[<a id="00-00-44">00:00:44</a>]  It's a it's the over 40 show

[<a id="00-00-48">00:00:48</a>]  Oh my god, so one second. Hey, it goes both ways

[<a id="00-00-53">00:00:53</a>]  but the thing about the over 40 show welcome to the growth show the growth note because

[<a id="00-00-59">00:00:59</a>]  compared to most Swiss audiences

[<a id="00-01-02">00:01:02</a>]  When we get the right people at the show they come drunk and they come to love and they look they just like make make me

[<a id="00-01-10">00:01:10</a>]  Love at whatever shit you still can you say horrible stuff? Oh you can

[<a id="00-01-15">00:01:15</a>]  but you've got to feel the crowd because

[<a id="00-01-20">00:01:20</a>]  You'll get some people that are down for everything and then you get those the the retarded people sit at the back and they just fold

[<a id="00-01-26">00:01:26</a>]  Their arms and then we because they're Swiss so we get Swiss people and the Swiss people like some fucking eggs pat

[<a id="00-01-34">00:01:34</a>]  How far is it from here?

[<a id="00-01-36">00:01:36</a>]  It's it's pretty close. It's prime. Tell me it's good back a little bit

[<a id="00-01-39">00:01:39</a>]  Is it like it's walkable, right?

[<a id="00-01-43">00:01:43</a>]  Yeah, okay. Let's walk into places. So that the number three tram you just follow that you get to

[<a id="00-01-50">00:01:50</a>]  I've seen the details. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like we're in LA

[<a id="00-01-54">00:01:54</a>]  It's my my favorite sketch by the way on SNL is Kelly

[<a id="00-01-58">00:01:58</a>]  Californians, I don't do I remember that one the California's is when they constantly talk about which way they drove to wherever they had to go

[<a id="00-02-06">00:02:06</a>]  Oh, that's funny. I forgot about that

[<a id="00-02-08">00:02:08</a>]  This is Swiss Californians

[<a id="00-02-14">00:02:14</a>]  Oh, which which line you took is that what yeah, so you take the tram line three and then you

[<a id="00-02-21">00:02:21</a>]  you change at the

[<a id="00-02-24">00:02:24</a>]  interchange with the 33

[<a id="00-02-27">00:02:27</a>]  The funny thing is there's one or two tram lines that are only there

[<a id="00-02-32">00:02:32</a>]  Because they have to be there. There's a number seven tram

[<a id="00-02-35">00:02:35</a>]  You only ever tired people on that tram. It's amazing. It's interesting because number seven is a

[<a id="00-02-42">00:02:42</a>]  Fucking most diverse area of New York City. It's the seven line to fly on the coast of flushing. Yeah

[<a id="00-02-48">00:02:48</a>]  Ah, see this fuck you go enough of those. No, but

[<a id="00-02-51">00:02:51</a>]  Yeah, it's a famous. It's you know, there's like movies about that shit. Yeah, this guy's he knows

[<a id="00-02-58">00:02:58</a>]  No shit, he doesn't need to know but that's why I was never successful in anything

[<a id="00-03-03">00:03:03</a>]  My brain is full with a bullshit information

[<a id="00-03-07">00:03:07</a>]  So what we're doing that we're gonna first of all, I want to

[<a id="00-03-12">00:03:12</a>]  Thank Ben. What's Ben's last name De La Haye without him. I wouldn't be here and

[<a id="00-03-18">00:03:18</a>]  Have you guys been so supportive? That is absolutely true and you guys are very very helpful

[<a id="00-03-23">00:03:23</a>]  And you guys are also amazingly great at criticizing Wow. Is this the podcast where we suck each other's dick for a while?

[<a id="00-03-31">00:03:31</a>]  No criticizing things like that. So

[<a id="00-03-34">00:03:34</a>]  Criticizing I mean a good feedback, you know

[<a id="00-03-38">00:03:38</a>]  Oh, but in New York at the seller or that

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  places like that man, it's

[<a id="00-03-46">00:03:46</a>]  It's fucking pretty vicious man

[<a id="00-03-48">00:03:48</a>]  Every time you think they're really nice the third one is like something really personal and like oh, oh, oh, so they go for that

[<a id="00-03-55">00:03:55</a>]  Wow, you did a really good set. Yeah, especially when you insulted that woman in the third row

[<a id="00-03-59">00:03:59</a>]  Can you take that cell phone slightly more away from there? Yeah

[<a id="00-04-02">00:04:02</a>]  But I mean, yeah, I think

[<a id="00-04-06">00:04:06</a>]  Your son was wonderful. We did a podcast who's I was surprised how

[<a id="00-04-11">00:04:11</a>]  Comfortable he was at that age, you know

[<a id="00-04-15">00:04:15</a>]  there are funny generation now and he's he's I

[<a id="00-04-18">00:04:18</a>]  Mean, it's really because they get so much input. It's like all the shit that we had to learn

[<a id="00-04-26">00:04:26</a>]  Yeah, it's all available to them on

[<a id="00-04-30">00:04:30</a>]  Online YouTube and Instagram and tick-tock. It's a vanish but disadvantage - I think yeah, because they're not really living

[<a id="00-04-38">00:04:38</a>]  I said there's a difference between like like seeing someone with an opinion and then actually having an experience yourself. Mm-hmm

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  but

[<a id="00-04-48">00:04:48</a>]  Yeah, I mean, he's also confident because he's done some comedy. It was less so a year ago

[<a id="00-04-54">00:04:54</a>]  Yeah, but now he's been on stage a few times

[<a id="00-04-57">00:04:57</a>]  Yeah, that help if you done stuff like that and actually seeing so many shows you probably have some idea, you know

[<a id="00-05-04">00:05:04</a>]  But I still actually know why he wanted to talk to you so much. Like he I thought was a joke to be honest

[<a id="00-05-10">00:05:10</a>]  Yeah, and I was very sincere. That's kind of exactly how is it possible that anything that come out of you could be so sincere?

[<a id="00-05-18">00:05:18</a>]  Hey, I got the most sincere come that you can imagine it just

[<a id="00-05-24">00:05:24</a>]  It goes it's on a mission it gets to where it's got to go

[<a id="00-05-28">00:05:28</a>]  No, I mean, I mean I surprised myself like I

[<a id="00-05-34">00:05:34</a>]  Was talking with him a bit today, we're both working so we didn't have a proper conversation as I

[<a id="00-05-40">00:05:40</a>]  Tell me why you want to do this and he didn't tell me the root cause

[<a id="00-05-46">00:05:46</a>]  yeah, but my gut says maybe it's something because I've talked about you and

[<a id="00-05-53">00:05:53</a>]  He kind of wants to be part of this part of my life, yeah

[<a id="00-05-58">00:05:58</a>]  then

[<a id="00-06-00">00:06:00</a>]  And I didn't know you guys want to leave I just figured you guys gonna sit in the couch or something

[<a id="00-06-04">00:06:04</a>]  I don't know you guys were leaving. Yeah, and like we get time off but I did tell him that

[<a id="00-06-09">00:06:09</a>]  He had I don't know if it's a friend or some colleagues and like that's weird spending time with your dad

[<a id="00-06-14">00:06:14</a>]  but I told him like man, I

[<a id="00-06-16">00:06:16</a>]  Wish I could spend I

[<a id="00-06-19">00:06:19</a>]  Wish I could have spent time with my dad when I was 18 years old, you know

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  because I was separated from my dad when I was 10 or 11 and

[<a id="00-06-25">00:06:25</a>]  Put them pretty much that's it. I mean something like once or twice, you know, I don't know maybe half a dozen time whatever but

[<a id="00-06-32">00:06:32</a>]  It doesn't matter what people think, you know, you got it I just told him like

[<a id="00-06-37">00:06:37</a>]  The last one and two minutes of your life you really gonna say like god

[<a id="00-06-42">00:06:42</a>]  I'm glad I did all those over times for Mercedes and

[<a id="00-06-45">00:06:45</a>]  I'm glad I fuck all those women that didn't care for me and I'm glad I listened to all the people told me they was

[<a id="00-06-51">00:06:51</a>]  Weird I spent time with my dad stupid faggot, you know

[<a id="00-06-55">00:06:55</a>]  That's it, you know, honestly, I a I start to realize that now. Yeah

[<a id="00-07-03">00:07:03</a>]  I'm lucky enough that my dad is around. He's

[<a id="00-07-07">00:07:07</a>]  Yeah, he's still full of life at this point he's about to get

[<a id="00-07-11">00:07:11</a>]  Well, he's a couple of years away from

[<a id="00-07-14">00:07:14</a>]  Retiring but how does he about?

[<a id="00-07-18">00:07:18</a>]  That is about 63 64. That's crazy. That's only like nine years difference with me, you know, right? Yeah

[<a id="00-07-25">00:07:25</a>]  yeah, and I

[<a id="00-07-27">00:07:27</a>]  Know that he will never properly return there. He will always work. That's a good thing

[<a id="00-07-33">00:07:33</a>]  I don't think retirement stopping is that's gonna kill it

[<a id="00-07-37">00:07:37</a>]  Yeah, because because it's like it's you can you can retire as long as you have some kind of purpose

[<a id="00-07-42">00:07:42</a>]  Well, it is what happened to his dad. So when his dad retired

[<a id="00-07-47">00:07:47</a>]  He immediately went into deep sickness like Parkinson's. Yeah, and it was downhill from there now

[<a id="00-07-55">00:07:55</a>]  You could say a Parkinson's is you know, it would have happened either way

[<a id="00-07-59">00:07:59</a>]  But I do feel it had like that the trigger was there of like oh

[<a id="00-08-04">00:08:04</a>]  Pension now, there's nothing. Yeah. Yeah, but it's one of those things of life. It's like

[<a id="00-08-10">00:08:10</a>]  You learn over time. It used to be went when I was when I was 18 as Ben's age

[<a id="00-08-16">00:08:16</a>]  Like I could lie around all day doing nothing. I think if I do that now I'm like my body is just

[<a id="00-08-23">00:08:23</a>]  Yeah, things hurt. So I do could you at least move and

[<a id="00-08-28">00:08:28</a>]  And that's the point. It's like the the

[<a id="00-08-31">00:08:31</a>]  On a sense of happiness you talk about happiness. Oh happiness is not not doing anything

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  and being inactive is not happiness and

[<a id="00-08-43">00:08:43</a>]  Like I feel like in the West the simplistic model of how we're supposed to live our lives as you go work

[<a id="00-08-48">00:08:48</a>]  Yeah, you retire and then you fuck all and drink cocktails by the beach or something. Yeah, that's like a path to self-destruction

[<a id="00-08-56">00:08:56</a>]  What's interesting here? There was a the Swiss girlfriend. I had she had this

[<a id="00-09-01">00:09:01</a>]  She had this little office and these dudes in the room next to her

[<a id="00-09-06">00:09:06</a>]  two guys who were

[<a id="00-09-09">00:09:09</a>]  Scientists they both retired and yeah, they rented this office to carry on doing scientific research

[<a id="00-09-16">00:09:16</a>]  Yeah, and I thought that's and that's the sort of thing because you got an active brain. You can't just like

[<a id="00-09-22">00:09:22</a>]  Decide okay. Now I'm just gonna think about clouds. Yeah, I think there are some people that can do that and I'm kind of jealous

[<a id="00-09-31">00:09:31</a>]  Like people that go on cruises

[<a id="00-09-36">00:09:36</a>]  Yeah, but comedians go on cruises as well and I know what you mean I think that would drive me crazy

[<a id="00-09-42">00:09:42</a>]  I don't think it's a fun thing for me. Yeah, hell no, it's it's my worst fucking nightmare. Yeah, a good friend of mine

[<a id="00-09-47">00:09:47</a>]  recently went on the cruise and I

[<a id="00-09-50">00:09:50</a>]  Dearly love him, but fuck me dead. It's

[<a id="00-09-54">00:09:54</a>]  it's basically like

[<a id="00-09-57">00:09:57</a>]  You go for fat dinners every night

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  you were spending time with people that you never chose to hang out with and

[<a id="00-10-05">00:10:05</a>]  Then you party on the boat with exactly the same people and you get shit face from 9 a.m. You know

[<a id="00-10-12">00:10:12</a>]  Fucking I love to get shit face from 9 a.m. Don't get me wrong, but

[<a id="00-10-18">00:10:18</a>]  - to me. It's just why I would want a cinema where they're playing Titanic on a loop

[<a id="00-10-24">00:10:24</a>]  If you're on a cruise ship, have you ever done a cruise ship?

[<a id="00-10-27">00:10:27</a>]  Oh, yeah, no, no, but I want to say you you'd say something really interesting and

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  dead-on in my opinion because that's that's something I was talking to your son because

[<a id="00-10-36">00:10:36</a>]  We were all I mean we were in once teenagers

[<a id="00-10-39">00:10:39</a>]  but

[<a id="00-10-41">00:10:41</a>]  He see when I don't know what was it like for you

[<a id="00-10-44">00:10:44</a>]  But my biggest problem back then when I was teenager like boredom like nothing to do

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  and of course I could hit back at a hands like wouldn't you get a go to live read or something or get a job or

[<a id="00-10-54">00:10:54</a>]  Well, I'll make you do stuff like clean the house or something, right?

[<a id="00-10-59">00:10:59</a>]  But that's like if you're bored you go always find something to do

[<a id="00-11-02">00:11:02</a>]  because of the

[<a id="00-11-05">00:11:05</a>]  social media

[<a id="00-11-07">00:11:07</a>]  Your son's generation replace boredom with anxiety. Yeah, and

[<a id="00-11-11">00:11:11</a>]  Anxiety is a much difficult monster to deal with boredom

[<a id="00-11-17">00:11:17</a>]  You go always figure out something interesting to do and you could kill it, you know if you want it

[<a id="00-11-21">00:11:21</a>]  It's a it's it's something that you have to make a choice over

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  Yeah, and then remember yesterday I said that but the most of the young people are dealing with Judaism or the Gavarian Judaism

[<a id="00-11-32">00:11:32</a>]  which is kind of a lot of psychoanalysis because Jews are obsessed with

[<a id="00-11-36">00:11:36</a>]  psychoanalysis

[<a id="00-11-38">00:11:38</a>]  That's the real religion of Jews, you know

[<a id="00-11-40">00:11:40</a>]  And I mean we live in like you guys live in Switzerland where you have Carl you and Freud living here for God's sake

[<a id="00-11-47">00:11:47</a>]  You know, what's the ratio of the population to therapists? It's like one in four. Let's have a look. Is it that high?

[<a id="00-11-54">00:11:54</a>]  It's really the Swiss people love their therapy and that in the cut your country is shaped with all those mountains around

[<a id="00-12-01">00:12:01</a>]  sometimes they look like brain or something that the country shape is like a

[<a id="00-12-05">00:12:05</a>]  like a

[<a id="00-12-07">00:12:07</a>]  That's true. Actually. Yeah. Yeah, like a diagram of the brain brain and you have all this mental shit over here

[<a id="00-12-14">00:12:14</a>]  And in the you have all this therapist and you have all this like like like extreme Protestant

[<a id="00-12-21">00:12:21</a>]  Preachers 500 years ago. I don't know it's like

[<a id="00-12-24">00:12:24</a>]  Hippocampus and I don't know. It's really weird shaping like almost like a brain part of the brain or something, you know, but

[<a id="00-12-32">00:12:32</a>]  Because because these kids know so many stuff about

[<a id="00-12-36">00:12:36</a>]  trigger

[<a id="00-12-38">00:12:38</a>]  PTSD because I didn't know any of that shit now, but it's we are teaching that language though as well

[<a id="00-12-43">00:12:43</a>]  I know but because they know those words they think everything is PTSD and trigger right? Yeah, and that's not good either

[<a id="00-12-49">00:12:49</a>]  Okay, so what do you reckon the ratio of?

[<a id="00-12-51">00:12:51</a>]  occupational therapists in Switzerland is

[<a id="00-12-54">00:12:54</a>]  Population give it give us a ratio. So I said one in four one in four. Yeah, you're way too way too high

[<a id="00-13-03">00:13:03</a>]  One in a thousand

[<a id="00-13-07">00:13:07</a>]  Yoshi one out of fifty one out of fifty every 10,000 inhabitants

[<a id="00-13-13">00:13:13</a>]  3.2

[<a id="00-13-17">00:13:17</a>]  Okay, but what does that mean compared to other countries that's the that's what it really important to know

[<a id="00-13-22">00:13:22</a>]  Yeah, but it's a ratio of patients

[<a id="00-13-24">00:13:24</a>]  Therapists is everything. I mean, New York City. I don't know that sounds like

[<a id="00-13-28">00:13:28</a>]  I'm sure New York City is pretty fucking high

[<a id="00-13-31">00:13:31</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  The thing the thing is on this up. My son doesn't have the he never got into the whole workness

[<a id="00-13-38">00:13:38</a>]  No, but he seemed like a too smart for that. Yeah, I'm going to trade school. There are more practical people, you know

[<a id="00-13-44">00:13:44</a>]  Yeah, I know. So it's a fun the funny thing is he's doing this apprenticeship. I'll just say whatever Mercedes. Yeah, and

[<a id="00-13-52">00:13:52</a>]  He's in an old-school male environment. He tells me some of the stuff that's anti walk. There's no women

[<a id="00-14-00">00:14:00</a>]  Well, yeah, they're all these are mechanics. Yeah, you can imagine. It's just racism and misogyny. Yeah

[<a id="00-14-05">00:14:05</a>]  Okay. Okay. Sorry. I'm being the Jamie here on this one

[<a id="00-14-10">00:14:10</a>]  so

[<a id="00-14-14">00:14:14</a>]  Which country do you reckon has the highest density when it comes to therapists per

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  inhabitants

[<a id="00-14-22">00:14:22</a>]  psychotherapists

[<a id="00-14-23">00:14:23</a>]  Interesting oddly. I don't think is it Israel because they're they're real

[<a id="00-14-27">00:14:27</a>]  Fighters and shit there too, but I'm going I mean, okay America would be over space, but it's not the whole country

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  You know that America the way America trees as in the USA now, I'm going I'm putting my Germany

[<a id="00-14-42">00:14:42</a>]  No, I'm gonna go to Scandinavia. Oh

[<a id="00-14-44">00:14:44</a>]  No, Argentina

[<a id="00-14-47">00:14:47</a>]  Why why Argentina?

[<a id="00-14-49">00:14:49</a>]  222 psychologists per 100,000. Oh, that's right. All those Nazis like the Argentine

[<a id="00-14-55">00:14:55</a>]  They have Wow, I would have never guessed Argentina wasn't Argentina where Mengele ended up as well. Yeah

[<a id="00-15-04">00:15:04</a>]  Yeah, I think so. Yeah

[<a id="00-15-09">00:15:09</a>]  Either Argentina or you might have been like Europe way one of those kind of a pair of ways one of those kinds of places

[<a id="00-15-13">00:15:13</a>]  I think yeah, definitely South America. There's a lot of Germans in Brazil as well. Do you know about the Arctic Nazis? Yeah

[<a id="00-15-21">00:15:21</a>]  This is one of my favorite. No, this is not one of those podcasts Harry. This is very great. This come very quickly

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  It makes me laugh every time so apparently there's a bunch of

[<a id="00-15-34">00:15:34</a>]  German submarines are unaccounted for okay to okay the conspiracy theories is that it's like a hundred of them

[<a id="00-15-40">00:15:40</a>]  They all went down to the South

[<a id="00-15-43">00:15:43</a>]  the South Pole the South Pole the South Antarctic where yeah and

[<a id="00-15-48">00:15:48</a>]  And that there's an underground like ice cave

[<a id="00-15-51">00:15:51</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-15-52">00:15:52</a>]  Where they're living and that they found UFO technology and the UFO is actually the Arctic Nazis

[<a id="00-15-59">00:15:59</a>]  Okay, it's and I like I watched some retarded conspiracy theory

[<a id="00-16-04">00:16:04</a>]  It's it's like the creativity where you go with linking this to your you're talking about the sheer

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  Fantasy that went into creating this stuff. Yeah is incredible. This is a conspiracy. Yeah. Yeah

[<a id="00-16-17">00:16:17</a>]  Yeah, I know they've got a whole story because there was apparently

[<a id="00-16-20">00:16:20</a>]  some

[<a id="00-16-22">00:16:22</a>]  U.s. Mission to visit the Antarctic in 47 after the war. Yeah, and they were they were greeted with a sea Kyle

[<a id="00-16-31">00:16:31</a>]  or no, they had the stories they had to turn back and they don't know it's

[<a id="00-16-35">00:16:35</a>]  A cover of what and the real story is is there was nothing there and they were running out of fuel and food

[<a id="00-16-42">00:16:42</a>]  So that's a good idea to go home, but but the conspiracy theories like the Arctic Nazis

[<a id="00-16-47">00:16:47</a>]  Send them away

[<a id="00-16-51">00:16:51</a>]  I just love that. Yeah. Yeah interesting knowledge. You know had no idea I thought you know America would be

[<a id="00-16-59">00:16:59</a>]  No, but maybe not America when you're saying do you think about the Midwest as well?

[<a id="00-17-03">00:17:03</a>]  Like this is this is why America to me is always so fast. I have Jesus

[<a id="00-17-08">00:17:08</a>]  Yeah, yeah

[<a id="00-17-12">00:17:12</a>]  Joel Osteen, so it's

[<a id="00-17-14">00:17:14</a>]  The crazy thing about the United States is like all on the coasts

[<a id="00-17-18">00:17:18</a>]  you obviously have this kind of like hyper aware and

[<a id="00-17-22">00:17:22</a>]  What do you walk a hyper woke and everything is extremes and that's mostly on the cold one West Coast and maybe in upper

[<a id="00-17-31">00:17:31</a>]  East Coast, but when you go south you have like North and South Carolina and places like that

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  They're not necessarily like woke people. I don't know for sure

[<a id="00-17-39">00:17:39</a>]  What's the most fucked up place in America that you did comedy Idaho?

[<a id="00-17-44">00:17:44</a>]  What are we fucked up now like place where you're like, wow, this is this place is a mess or this is like the crowd

[<a id="00-17-50">00:17:50</a>]  It was really weird. I can't say that because remember what my uncle said how to deal with racist people become a bigger racist

[<a id="00-17-57">00:17:57</a>]  So they have no impact on me. No, I don't mean like more like aggressive heckling

[<a id="00-18-03">00:18:03</a>]  I just like a place we just saw what the fuck am I doing here?

[<a id="00-18-06">00:18:06</a>]  Do you ever have or just well, I mean that show when I open for Jim Norton in

[<a id="00-18-11">00:18:11</a>]  Atlantic City where three thousand people booing me. It wasn't it wasn't fun

[<a id="00-18-15">00:18:15</a>]  But I wasn't even like a physical thread. Why were they already booing you?

[<a id="00-18-21">00:18:21</a>]  Because I was a bitch-ass comic. I was trying to do like a

[<a id="00-18-24">00:18:24</a>]  La positive feel-good comedy and they fucking hated that you did feel-good comedy. Well, this is 2005 or something

[<a id="00-18-32">00:18:32</a>]  So we're you were trying to find out who you were. It doesn't work. It's I don't have that work

[<a id="00-18-38">00:18:38</a>]  Do you remember any of the jokes? No. Oh, man

[<a id="00-18-41">00:18:41</a>]  But yeah, it was one of those like soon as a couple people booed everybody start booing like yeah. Yeah. How long did you do?

[<a id="00-18-50">00:18:50</a>]  I still did like 10 minutes. I was supposed to do 15 minutes or something, but I was getting booed the whole time

[<a id="00-18-55">00:18:55</a>]  But they blew me after the show nine hours later when I was walking out of the hotel walking across the casino to my rental

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  Car, there was still 20 or 30 guys from the show like staying

[<a id="00-19-06">00:19:06</a>]  Seven eight hours later. They saw me they start booing me in the middle of the casino

[<a id="00-19-09">00:19:09</a>]  Yeah, but I I needed that I deserve to get booed. I

[<a id="00-19-14">00:19:14</a>]  Showed up and not gave what they want. So I fucking deserved it. And okay, hopefully I learned from that

[<a id="00-19-22">00:19:22</a>]  Apropos one little detail apropos Jim Norton's might need to be added to that

[<a id="00-19-27">00:19:27</a>]  I just saw a little reel that he put on his Instagram. Okay with his tranny wife on some podcast

[<a id="00-19-33">00:19:33</a>]  Uh-huh, and it hit me then what she's a machine or he is about

[<a id="00-19-37">00:19:37</a>]  She's she wants to be a bigger star than Jim Norton. He's oh, well, I mean that's isn't that anybody in show business?

[<a id="00-19-44">00:19:44</a>]  No, no, it's it's like it because okay, he's got money

[<a id="00-19-48">00:19:48</a>]  He she I mean, but she's she's writing him not for the money for she's about to launch a career

[<a id="00-19-54">00:19:54</a>]  She's over Kelly out thing. She's gonna be the next

[<a id="00-19-57">00:19:57</a>]  Kim

[<a id="00-19-59">00:19:59</a>]  Action Robert Kelly once asked like hey Jimmy, you want to go to cigar bar and smoke some cigars after the show

[<a id="00-20-05">00:20:05</a>]  And then she's gonna dump Jim Norton and he's gonna come running to you, man

[<a id="00-20-09">00:20:09</a>]  So Robert Kelly asked him. Hey, Jimmy, you want to go in and go to cigar bar smoke singers now

[<a id="00-20-15">00:20:15</a>]  I'm gonna go home have a nice dinner and suck my wife's cock. So

[<a id="00-20-18">00:20:18</a>]  You know

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  That's Jimmy and she's she does have bigger dick than him. So it's only fair that she should be bigger star

[<a id="00-20-30">00:20:30</a>]  Oh

[<a id="00-20-32">00:20:32</a>]  Just lovely and I didn't you matter I met her in 2017 when they were having some issues, but I made her Norway

[<a id="00-20-39">00:20:39</a>]  She's Norwegian. I just happen to be there. So I ended up opening for Jim

[<a id="00-20-42">00:20:42</a>]  That wasn't the original plan. I was there for some other thing. I find out like oh Jim Sears could I open for him?

[<a id="00-20-48">00:20:48</a>]  He just let me open because I'm already there. He doesn't have to pay for my

[<a id="00-20-51">00:20:51</a>]  Lodging and flying so but we were she were having some legal issues, but you know

[<a id="00-20-58">00:20:58</a>]  Guys nice lady. Can I ask you sorry I have to get away from a

[<a id="00-21-02">00:21:02</a>]  Trans conversation on this one. Yeah

[<a id="00-21-05">00:21:05</a>]  You were saying before you wanted to

[<a id="00-21-08">00:21:08</a>]  Subject you were booed because you didn't give the audience what they want. Yeah, I sucked. I find that like last night

[<a id="00-21-15">00:21:15</a>]  But I find that interesting how you phrased that it's not that

[<a id="00-21-20">00:21:20</a>]  You bombed because your jokes were bad

[<a id="00-21-24">00:21:24</a>]  You didn't give the audience what they wanted joke was bad. I'm not I'm not

[<a id="00-21-29">00:21:29</a>]  I'm not a known person and I didn't give them what they want and they also think booing somebody's funny

[<a id="00-21-35">00:21:35</a>]  And it is it is funny. It is funny, especially the next morning. I find. Yes. That's like the best call back

[<a id="00-21-42">00:21:42</a>]  I've ever heard of and and these experiences are necessary, you know, I I think

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  But when you say you didn't give the audience what they wanted I want to drill into that was also stupid not knowing

[<a id="00-21-55">00:21:55</a>]  West Coast audiences are far different from the West Coast

[<a id="00-21-58">00:21:58</a>]  Yeah, so but this is fascinating because when you say this it's like you're not doing what you want to do

[<a id="00-22-04">00:22:04</a>]  You do what the audience wants to do. Well

[<a id="00-22-06">00:22:06</a>]  look

[<a id="00-22-08">00:22:08</a>]  They didn't come to see you. So they went to see Jim and you're some annoyance that they don't want to see

[<a id="00-22-14">00:22:14</a>]  Not only that I didn't while there was like something different original

[<a id="00-22-19">00:22:19</a>]  So what they really want is like quick short something that it make them happy and I did none of those things

[<a id="00-22-25">00:22:25</a>]  And and I got booed and I deserve to get booed because I was terrible and and I bump

[<a id="00-22-33">00:22:33</a>]  But bombing is kind of funny in a way because um, do you ever watch that bad?

[<a id="00-22-39">00:22:39</a>]  Magazines five versus five. Yeah

[<a id="00-22-41">00:22:41</a>]  Yeah, it's like me

[<a id="00-22-44">00:22:44</a>]  Just blowing myself up

[<a id="00-22-48">00:22:48</a>]  But

[<a id="00-22-49">00:22:49</a>]  Yeah, I I've done so many shitty shows and I have some good shows, but those shitty was it's so memorable

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  I can't really remember all the good ones

[<a id="00-22-57">00:22:57</a>]  I'm not sometimes people say man you were so good that I don't remember any of it the bad ones

[<a id="00-23-01">00:23:01</a>]  I always remember man. They're just oh they stick with you. Yeah those but

[<a id="00-23-05">00:23:05</a>]  Those better ones fine. If you learn something from it, you know, what was the first gig you ever did? Hi. Oh

[<a id="00-23-11">00:23:11</a>]  It was a country key

[<a id="00-23-15">00:23:15</a>]  18 and what's a country key? What is that?

[<a id="00-23-19">00:23:19</a>]  Contiki is probably the longest running open mic in Zurich

[<a id="00-23-23">00:23:23</a>]  Is that a name of the police? No, it's yeah

[<a id="00-23-26">00:23:26</a>]  Yeah, yeah, that's like a Polynesian stuff. It is it is a sticky bar. Oh, okay. It's a wee but

[<a id="00-23-34">00:23:34</a>]  and

[<a id="00-23-36">00:23:36</a>]  It's it's a strange place because it's a Tiki bar where all the stoners go

[<a id="00-23-42">00:23:42</a>]  Yeah, but also all the fans of a specific football club

[<a id="00-23-46">00:23:46</a>]  Which is bizarre. It's an FC Z

[<a id="00-23-49">00:23:49</a>]  How somehow anyway, but

[<a id="00-23-53">00:23:53</a>]  They started open mics there in I want to say 2017. Yeah, you're in credit to the guy. So I'm it is a Turkish

[<a id="00-24-02">00:24:02</a>]  American comedian he's I mean comedian. He wasn't if you say I made you don't have to say Turkish. It's understood

[<a id="00-24-08">00:24:08</a>]  okay, and he saw that thing and he

[<a id="00-24-12">00:24:12</a>]  Yeah, he kind of created the scene here together with Ben

[<a id="00-24-15">00:24:15</a>]  Yeah, Ben in a different way, but but I'm it was the first guy to get a weekly show running

[<a id="00-24-20">00:24:20</a>]  gave us all spots and that's cool and

[<a id="00-24-23">00:24:23</a>]  Yeah, I really I really enjoy this because when I used to live in Sweden the same kind of

[<a id="00-24-29">00:24:29</a>]  Even that there is a there is a mid during stand-up there, too

[<a id="00-24-32">00:24:32</a>]  And I like when they were doing different shows in different part of the country in Sweden things like that

[<a id="00-24-37">00:24:37</a>]  I didn't make any money, but it's kind of fun to see different parts of the cup of course like and

[<a id="00-24-43">00:24:43</a>]  You meet all these people during stand-up and they're missed

[<a id="00-24-47">00:24:47</a>]  since fall some like middle of Sweden we did a show like ten years ago made me laugh because

[<a id="00-24-53">00:24:53</a>]  it's a

[<a id="00-24-55">00:24:55</a>]  American country bar in middle of nor in Sweden and everyone Swedish and what's what was funny is I was the only American

[<a id="00-25-01">00:25:01</a>]  And somebody oh, are you Native American?

[<a id="00-25-06">00:25:06</a>]  No, but could be a Native American for you tonight, but yeah, it's just it's it's fun

[<a id="00-25-09">00:25:09</a>]  You know and I don't let like yeah, Yoshi desu. Yeah, all right

[<a id="00-25-14">00:25:14</a>]  I got a dickish question a little bit inside comedy what then every other thing that you say stick is gonna be worse

[<a id="00-25-20">00:25:20</a>]  So when you talk about like your comedy career, they say what career go ahead

[<a id="00-25-26">00:25:26</a>]  Whatever your comedy evolution. Yeah, Harry likes to use the big words

[<a id="00-25-32">00:25:32</a>]  There's this magic moment where you find find your voice. Yeah, people saying that so you find your voice

[<a id="00-25-38">00:25:38</a>]  Yeah, have you found your voice?

[<a id="00-25-40">00:25:40</a>]  You know I was talking to my friend Maria yesterday and

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  She was somebody I know for 20 years in LA and she

[<a id="00-25-52">00:25:52</a>]  comedian and I can't even repeat some of the shit she say because she's a tiny little Jewish lady, but

[<a id="00-25-59">00:25:59</a>]  Whoo, she she was comfortable with the n-words and you know on and on but she told me

[<a id="00-26-06">00:26:06</a>]  nuclear yes, and

[<a id="00-26-09">00:26:09</a>]  She told me she knew from the day one that no matter what happened I will have interesting career, you know, and

[<a id="00-26-17">00:26:17</a>]  She had a heart attack and she still recovering. I miss her a lot, but

[<a id="00-26-26">00:26:26</a>]  When I have shows where when I make people like that laugh

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  Those ones that I'm really really I'm proud of them because they're very cynical comedians and then like man

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  I gotta admit that that shit was hilarious. Even the audience didn't like it

[<a id="00-26-39">00:26:39</a>]  Because let's be honest audience are like women. They don't know what they want

[<a id="00-26-42">00:26:42</a>]  They don't though

[<a id="00-26-45">00:26:45</a>]  You know, it's very true. Yes in my mind, but I feel like I'm like North Korean dictator

[<a id="00-26-51">00:26:51</a>]  I'll give you exactly what you need, you know

[<a id="00-26-53">00:26:53</a>]  But people get mad and they get upset because they give a shit about the audience here

[<a id="00-26-57">00:26:57</a>]  But that's a that's a problem of the North Korean dictator. Sometimes you don't give them enough. Yes

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  But yeah

[<a id="00-27-08">00:27:08</a>]  as far as boys I

[<a id="00-27-10">00:27:10</a>]  Have to say I'm really surprised by the Tuesday show

[<a id="00-27-14">00:27:14</a>]  Because I did 21 22 shows

[<a id="00-27-17">00:27:17</a>]  There was four or five shows I thought holy fuck man

[<a id="00-27-24">00:27:24</a>]  I've got something here. You did

[<a id="00-27-26">00:27:26</a>]  I don't know. I don't know why why some nights

[<a id="00-27-32">00:27:32</a>]  Did you did you did you ever read Plato's?

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  Work when he talked about Socrates. He said sometimes these voices come to his head

[<a id="00-27-42">00:27:42</a>]  He doesn't know where that come from

[<a id="00-27-44">00:27:44</a>]  Bob Dylan also talked about that like when he wasn't young things just came easy for him, you know

[<a id="00-27-50">00:27:50</a>]  I'm not talented. So like I don't really have way to engage with that

[<a id="00-27-54">00:27:54</a>]  I don't know if you want to call this spirit or something, but

[<a id="00-27-56">00:27:56</a>]  Those nights when when I'm relaxed and I'm not putting too much pressure and I have the right audience

[<a id="00-28-03">00:28:03</a>]  It is surprising it does like wow

[<a id="00-28-05">00:28:05</a>]  Yeah, because you allow yourself to go loosey-goosey you're not playing for someone that I'm not forcing it

[<a id="00-28-12">00:28:12</a>]  Yeah, yeah, I think it's it's the worst. I forced it last night

[<a id="00-28-18">00:28:18</a>]  It's the worst when you feel like you play for someone that's not even in their room. Yeah

[<a id="00-28-23">00:28:23</a>]  Even like Tuesday, I thought I think I'm not exactly sure what I'm gonna

[<a id="00-28-28">00:28:28</a>]  But I'm gonna cook a couple of them slowly and kind of gently tell them

[<a id="00-28-32">00:28:32</a>]  They're with me from

[<a id="00-28-35">00:28:35</a>]  First first minute, you know, I mean, I mean the difference is they like

[<a id="00-28-39">00:28:39</a>]  The setup of the show the script. Oh, yeah. Also we told them this is like a storytelling thing, you know

[<a id="00-28-45">00:28:45</a>]  And and this guy, you know, he's a pervert and he's got this horrible past like they knew

[<a id="00-28-52">00:28:52</a>]  Yeah, so

[<a id="00-28-54">00:28:54</a>]  Yeah, okay

[<a id="00-28-56">00:28:56</a>]  But a couple of stories even like yesterday a couple of the stories before I did the edgy stuff

[<a id="00-29-01">00:29:01</a>]  It cut them off guard, you know, it just

[<a id="00-29-03">00:29:03</a>]  It's wonderful when they when they hear something horrible. They just they just let autopilot with stereotype thinking

[<a id="00-29-12">00:29:12</a>]  Oh, he's just gonna do the typical like porn jokes or something. But when you sorry, what is the typical porn joke?

[<a id="00-29-18">00:29:18</a>]  I mean, there's a lot of like dumb over micros have it like have you watched this gonna pour, you know

[<a id="00-29-23">00:29:23</a>]  It's all kinds of dumb shit, you know, but when I listen to them like, okay

[<a id="00-29-26">00:29:26</a>]  You're repeating like a thousand other idiots saying the same thing, but I think I'm a little too much

[<a id="00-29-32">00:29:32</a>]  and

[<a id="00-29-35">00:29:35</a>]  I'd like to be a little bit more dignified, but that culture, you know, yeah

[<a id="00-29-42">00:29:42</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-29-43">00:29:43</a>]  What's that? I got it. It's the whole thing about being I got you up. You go

[<a id="00-29-48">00:29:48</a>]  Maybe the darkest funny is dating app joke. I've heard

[<a id="00-29-52">00:29:52</a>]  Oh, man, don't talk about it. Oh, no. No, it's fine

[<a id="00-29-57">00:29:57</a>]  But but but yeah, I mean I

[<a id="00-30-00">00:30:00</a>]  Don't remember how I said it. I told it Russell Peter once and that motherfucker told John Cleese

[<a id="00-30-08">00:30:08</a>]  He couldn't stop laughing, but I can't even remember what it was. It was something about

[<a id="00-30-13">00:30:13</a>]  Isn't it interesting?

[<a id="00-30-15">00:30:15</a>]  After Sandy Hook next day on Craigslist. There was abundant sale of used baby see

[<a id="00-30-23">00:30:23</a>]  for the vehicles

[<a id="00-30-25">00:30:25</a>]  Wait, what you know, there's a there's an extra seat for bigsters. Yeah, there was a baby see

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  Yeah, they were selling a lot of used ones next day after Sandy Hook

[<a id="00-30-34">00:30:34</a>]  true and

[<a id="00-30-36">00:30:36</a>]  I don't remember the way I said it but I

[<a id="00-30-40">00:30:40</a>]  Don't I I don't remember how I said it I stole Russell one that he told John Cleese

[<a id="00-30-45">00:30:45</a>]  He told me he couldn't stop laughing. I

[<a id="00-30-48">00:30:48</a>]  Noticed a pattern I noticed that on Craigslist

[<a id="00-30-53">00:30:53</a>]  Babysitters on sale. I don't know what you know, what's going on?

[<a id="00-30-56">00:30:56</a>]  But you be commitment to those mums, but like let's clear out all the shits immediately

[<a id="00-31-03">00:31:03</a>]  Finally, we got rid of I I mean we wanted our son to be that's like that's like but but I'm not doing it because I'm

[<a id="00-31-10">00:31:10</a>]  Mocking the dead. It's it's just that there are

[<a id="00-31-14">00:31:14</a>]  Gray individuals like cops medics doctors nurse they deal with that when they're when they keep hearing terrible things all the time

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  Mentally, they can't function, you know

[<a id="00-31-25">00:31:25</a>]  So they have to have dark humor because it's something that will sustain their ability to continue to do good things

[<a id="00-31-30">00:31:30</a>]  You know, it doesn't mean you make you joke about these things you you're happy that people are dead

[<a id="00-31-35">00:31:35</a>]  It's not that it's hard to explain to young person. Well people to understand that because they really don't have real major problems

[<a id="00-31-42">00:31:42</a>]  Yeah, but it's it's in the neighborhood of the shortest joke, right?

[<a id="00-31-45">00:31:45</a>]  The shortest joke is an advert

[<a id="00-31-51">00:31:51</a>]  Baby shoes. Oh, yeah, never born. Yeah

[<a id="00-31-56">00:31:56</a>]  It's it's in that neighborhood where it goes like, okay, it's a really really dark topic. Yes

[<a id="00-32-05">00:32:05</a>]  but

[<a id="00-32-06">00:32:06</a>]  You know, you have to overcome these sort of things and I find actually people that went through trauma. Yes

[<a id="00-32-13">00:32:13</a>]  Their sense of humor is usually

[<a id="00-32-16">00:32:16</a>]  Much more interesting. Yeah, it really is defense mechanism

[<a id="00-32-22">00:32:22</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-32-22">00:32:22</a>]  You know everything because life is fucked and especially when you go through these sort of things

[<a id="00-32-26">00:32:26</a>]  When you go through a war zone when you go through all that sort of stuff

[<a id="00-32-29">00:32:29</a>]  When you talk to to people that experience this

[<a id="00-32-34">00:32:34</a>]  They have to have this sort of defense when I wasn't Afghanistan first time

[<a id="00-32-38">00:32:38</a>]  2012 and obviously, I don't speak Pashtun or Dari. So I my friend saw

[<a id="00-32-45">00:32:45</a>]  Provided driver security guard and

[<a id="00-32-49">00:32:49</a>]  In the translator

[<a id="00-32-53">00:32:53</a>]  so we were going and

[<a id="00-32-55">00:32:55</a>]  You know, I don't speak the language, but I told can you ask the transfer? Can you tell them something?

[<a id="00-33-01">00:33:01</a>]  Can you ask them something? Sure. So I asked them if you have to kill me, how would you kill me, right?

[<a id="00-33-06">00:33:06</a>]  And then they were talking next 40 minutes. It was like

[<a id="00-33-08">00:33:08</a>]  Because they they started laughing because that's a really funny question like it's so dark like if you have to kill me

[<a id="00-33-15">00:33:15</a>]  How would you do it? Like maybe this motherfucker got elaborate the way he would have killed me

[<a id="00-33-20">00:33:20</a>]  But it's it's that kind of human like do I want to get killed of course not but

[<a id="00-33-25">00:33:25</a>]  They're in the stressful job one way to make connection with the people. It's humor, you know, and

[<a id="00-33-31">00:33:31</a>]  When I went pinch

[<a id="00-33-33">00:33:33</a>]  Policharki prison, which is the biggest prison in Afghanistan

[<a id="00-33-36">00:33:36</a>]  My friend Kimberly Motley. She's

[<a id="00-33-39">00:33:39</a>]  African-american half Korean lady. She's the only lawyer practicing law in

[<a id="00-33-44">00:33:44</a>]  Afghanistan as a foreigner and

[<a id="00-33-47">00:33:47</a>]  I got to know her we hit it off and couple this lady message was hey

[<a id="00-33-53">00:33:53</a>]  Would you like to go Policharki the biggest prison in Afghanistan? I said yes, you know, I went you know

[<a id="00-33-58">00:33:58</a>]  And and then when we went and the men you're the worst person to say yes to things. Well, it's just an ego

[<a id="00-34-05">00:34:05</a>]  Well, I mean, of course, it's like she's not gonna ask a black person. Okay, you want to go to prison

[<a id="00-34-09">00:34:09</a>]  You're not gonna ask black people like you want to go present because I mean even though it's their natural habitat

[<a id="00-34-23">00:34:23</a>]  Anyway, so I went I went to policharki prison so she had a three clients and she had to talk individually one of them

[<a id="00-34-30">00:34:30</a>]  But I met them all together at one time when she was getting ready to talk individually. They're all Western

[<a id="00-34-35">00:34:35</a>]  I can't remember their names, but they were like what one American one British one Australian. Let's compare notes here

[<a id="00-34-40">00:34:40</a>]  So I was in a supermax

[<a id="00-34-42">00:34:42</a>]  before

[<a id="00-34-44">00:34:44</a>]  So you in Colorado know in the business I visited a supermax

[<a id="00-34-49">00:34:49</a>]  These supermax in Colorado not the supermax in Colorado. No, no, I was in Pelican Bay. Okay, so

[<a id="00-34-54">00:34:54</a>]  Let's compare. I just that's the last show I did in America in Christian City. That's where they really yes

[<a id="00-35-00">00:35:00</a>]  Okay, so how is the biggest prison in?

[<a id="00-35-04">00:35:04</a>]  Tell me about what is the circumstance where you went Pelican Bay because I wanted to go

[<a id="00-35-09">00:35:09</a>]  Okay, so visit not to stay there. Yeah, clearly. No one really wants to stay there

[<a id="00-35-15">00:35:15</a>]  I had a partner at one point and she was very involved with

[<a id="00-35-21">00:35:21</a>]  Helping people in prison. She was a wife

[<a id="00-35-25">00:35:25</a>]  We cut that I

[<a id="00-35-30">00:35:30</a>]  Was told not to say, oh, yeah

[<a id="00-35-32">00:35:32</a>]  So this motherfucker

[<a id="00-35-35">00:35:35</a>]  You know, he look like one of the leader for that but for the story

[<a id="00-35-39">00:35:39</a>]  That's an important detail because it makes it much more interesting. Okay, cool

[<a id="00-35-44">00:35:44</a>]  so

[<a id="00-35-46">00:35:46</a>]  That there are

[<a id="00-35-49">00:35:49</a>]  people on death row in Pelican Bay, yes, and

[<a id="00-35-51">00:35:51</a>]  My ex-partner she was involved in

[<a id="00-35-55">00:35:55</a>]  Keeping engaged with these people like through writing letters and all that stuff like pen pal shit. Yeah

[<a id="00-36-03">00:36:03</a>]  and

[<a id="00-36-05">00:36:05</a>]  we

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  went to

[<a id="00-36-08">00:36:08</a>]  California and we did a trip

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  This is so bad we did it we did trip to the wine country. Yes from San Francisco and that's basically off the road

[<a id="00-36-19">00:36:19</a>]  Drove to Napa Valley and on the way to Napa Valley. We went to Pelican Bay. Yeah, it's a middle of nowhere

[<a id="00-36-27">00:36:27</a>]  It's a really not an easy drive through mountains and forests and shit like that. Yeah, I ended up in the wrong entrance. Yeah

[<a id="00-36-34">00:36:34</a>]  Can happen to anyone I was driving

[<a id="00-36-39">00:36:39</a>]  I was driving a bright red. Yeah, it's charger and

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  At the delivery entrance of Pelican Bay at the security guard just stared at me like what the fuck are you doing here?

[<a id="00-36-52">00:36:52</a>]  We had to show our passports like you guys are so lost. No, we have an appointment

[<a id="00-36-57">00:36:57</a>]  It's like oh you have to go all the way around. Yeah

[<a id="00-37-00">00:37:00</a>]  So she had to talk one of the inmates she met one of the inmates and was not allowed into the prison. Yes

[<a id="00-37-07">00:37:07</a>]  But here's the thing this is why I'm asking this so you met all of the guys that your lawyer friends

[<a id="00-37-13">00:37:13</a>]  Met in the same room

[<a id="00-37-15">00:37:15</a>]  There it was like inside of the prison, but it's like like a court where I'll sign

[<a id="00-37-21">00:37:21</a>]  But there's also a bunch of different fences separating other prisoners there, too

[<a id="00-37-25">00:37:25</a>]  I'm gonna make common a poly track in a second

[<a id="00-37-27">00:37:27</a>]  But Pelican Bay was interesting because two things one in in training day

[<a id="00-37-32">00:37:32</a>]  When Denzel Washington was threatening all those black people in the name you better shut the fuck up. I'll send you Pelican Bay

[<a id="00-37-38">00:37:38</a>]  They shut the fuck up, you know had the reputation and I'm pretty sure we used to get letters from Pelican Bay for Buttman magazine

[<a id="00-37-44">00:37:44</a>]  Hell yes, because we used to get letter from inmates all over the country. Well, we were getting

[<a id="00-37-51">00:37:51</a>]  We were getting

[<a id="00-37-54">00:37:54</a>]  inmate

[<a id="00-37-55">00:37:55</a>]  inmate letters from prison that allow pornography and

[<a id="00-37-59">00:37:59</a>]  But I remember my friend Don she was working downstairs and I heard her scream and the reason why she cream

[<a id="00-38-05">00:38:05</a>]  I think it was from Pelican Bay, but

[<a id="00-38-07">00:38:07</a>]  The fan is such a big fan of Buttman magazine he jacked up into tissue sent it as like a fan letter

[<a id="00-38-15">00:38:15</a>]  So we call we call the president like hey, we can't have this guy send letters like that again, you know

[<a id="00-38-20">00:38:20</a>]  Like blah blah blah. We also get letters from inmates for fans, but they also do fan art

[<a id="00-38-28">00:38:28</a>]  They will do art like drawing like girl with a big-ass order for Buttman magazine beautiful

[<a id="00-38-32">00:38:32</a>]  And if they're good, we'll print them providing that they didn't commit any sex crimes

[<a id="00-38-36">00:38:36</a>]  So like if they commit murder, okay murders, okay, but guffaw if you rape somebody we can't use your artwork

[<a id="00-38-42">00:38:42</a>]  So like I used to but prison letters are so easy because

[<a id="00-38-48">00:38:48</a>]  You learn so much about fantasy because this is a ground zero what's going on in the country you have

[<a id="00-38-57">00:38:57</a>]  criminals

[<a id="00-38-58">00:38:58</a>]  talking to other criminals

[<a id="00-38-59">00:38:59</a>]  They're doing terrible things and the only time they have any moment for themselves when they're sleeping and they're manufacturing this fantasy

[<a id="00-39-08">00:39:08</a>]  because they're in prison and they're doing with all the unpleasant things and these fantasies are very very interesting to me because

[<a id="00-39-14">00:39:14</a>]  There's been many times when you have the wrong

[<a id="00-39-17">00:39:17</a>]  Roommates where two guys with similar sexual fantasies. Believe me once they get out. They're trying to do shit together. It's a bad news for

[<a id="00-39-26">00:39:26</a>]  society, yes, because

[<a id="00-39-28">00:39:28</a>]  Toolbox killers, they're both were inmates and like someplace in San Luis Obispo or something and there's plenty other times

[<a id="00-39-34">00:39:34</a>]  I mean may I remind you that Stalin and

[<a id="00-39-37">00:39:37</a>]  Hitler both went to prison. They have too much free time to think about things, you know

[<a id="00-39-42">00:39:42</a>]  They developed some of the terrible things in prison

[<a id="00-39-45">00:39:45</a>]  It's present. It's not as thing to deter crime as you think it is. Sometimes they become bigger criminal or it's a fucking Petri dish

[<a id="00-39-54">00:39:54</a>]  Yeah, it's it's completely fucking insane

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  Yeah, and the dead, you know

[<a id="00-39-59">00:39:59</a>]  Like this is why I'm so interested also how how it is dealt with in in Afghanistan. Yeah, where it is the biggest prison

[<a id="00-40-08">00:40:08</a>]  Holly Chalkett was the biggest present dick could they execute most people there?

[<a id="00-40-12">00:40:12</a>]  it was under control of Soviets and then other people took over but the

[<a id="00-40-16">00:40:16</a>]  Kimberly's clients were English British America and I cannot move but I just know one had something to do with murder

[<a id="00-40-23">00:40:23</a>]  Tax evasion and drugs and murder the Holy Trinity the murder is getting the least amount of time, you know, and I think I

[<a id="00-40-31">00:40:31</a>]  Don't know which one got more time

[<a id="00-40-33">00:40:33</a>]  Drugs or tax evasion, but anyway, they're there so they see me with her and they don't trust me

[<a id="00-40-39">00:40:39</a>]  But soon as Kimberly said, oh he works in porn. They're all cool, you know, right pornography

[<a id="00-40-45">00:40:45</a>]  you know is a

[<a id="00-40-48">00:40:48</a>]  Definitely trustworthy venture because

[<a id="00-40-53">00:40:53</a>]  It's a business where you show your asshole pussy and dick and like, you know

[<a id="00-40-57">00:40:57</a>]  They're fucking and they're doing do such a raw thing like there's not a whole lot

[<a id="00-41-00">00:41:00</a>]  We really hide, you know, and when I tell them I work with Batman or whatever like one of the guys

[<a id="00-41-05">00:41:05</a>]  Oh, I love Batman magazine, whatever. So, you know, it's um

[<a id="00-41-08">00:41:08</a>]  You know working porn does have advantage. It's like that show in Generation Kill in

[<a id="00-41-14">00:41:14</a>]  HBO yes the jocks that the

[<a id="00-41-18">00:41:18</a>]  Reported that who were embedded with those guys. He really soon. Yes, but before that he was working for hustler

[<a id="00-41-24">00:41:24</a>]  Really? Yes, it always started with a hustler and I met him. I didn't realize I

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  Didn't realize I made him until a couple months ago because um, he was in Seattle during WTO riots

[<a id="00-41-37">00:41:37</a>]  I was working that day. So I remember a guy walked in like, oh, yeah, I used to write for hustler blah blah

[<a id="00-41-42">00:41:42</a>]  I'm here for reporting item then

[<a id="00-41-44">00:41:44</a>]  He killed himself like eight months ago and then that writer. Yeah, and I'm blanking off son his name, but he

[<a id="00-41-52">00:41:52</a>]  Incredible writer in fact one other thing he wrote he was hanging out with David Foster Wallace one of the greatest American modern writer

[<a id="00-42-02">00:42:02</a>]  he and this writer went to

[<a id="00-42-05">00:42:05</a>]  1998

[<a id="00-42-07">00:42:07</a>]  AVN porn a war show porn convention and they were hanging out with my evil angel colleague even a year before I went there

[<a id="00-42-15">00:42:15</a>]  For the first time and when I read it's crazy because his name is Evan, right? That's right, Evan, right and

[<a id="00-42-21">00:42:21</a>]  When he read the section that short story he wrote about his porn experience in Vegas

[<a id="00-42-26">00:42:26</a>]  They mentioned everybody that worked with evil angel. I would have mentioned if I work the year prior to that, you know, but

[<a id="00-42-33">00:42:33</a>]  Yeah, so everyone right he was saying like all this Marines trusted him right away

[<a id="00-42-38">00:42:38</a>]  But like I don't we don't fucking trust you man fucking media and stuff like that

[<a id="00-42-42">00:42:42</a>]  But we're for hustler like what so like like she said like yeah, I used to write I forgot

[<a id="00-42-47">00:42:47</a>]  Yeah, because that's in the first episode. That's the whole conversation. Yeah, that's right

[<a id="00-42-53">00:42:53</a>]  Yeah, so when you work for porn like you're a different kind of person like you know a lot about porn shit

[<a id="00-42-58">00:42:58</a>]  You're more honest and I tell you this

[<a id="00-43-01">00:43:01</a>]  Army boys as soon as the uniform is on

[<a id="00-43-05">00:43:05</a>]  Porn it's bigger than cigarettes. It's what you trade. Do you know? Do you know who was sending these a great American?

[<a id="00-43-14">00:43:14</a>]  men

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  Protecting America who was sending them so many fucking free DVDs. You're looking at that guy

[<a id="00-43-22">00:43:22</a>]  That's my patriotic duty to send free porn to this

[<a id="00-43-25">00:43:25</a>]  American men who are fighting for freedom and liberty and

[<a id="00-43-29">00:43:29</a>]  It's just I sing all this amazing porn because just boys just remember what you're fighting for

[<a id="00-43-34">00:43:34</a>]  I

[<a id="00-43-37">00:43:37</a>]  Even had some of the girls sign like be safe, you know

[<a id="00-43-40">00:43:40</a>]  Send them sign autograph and things like that because that's something I learned from porn shop

[<a id="00-43-44">00:43:44</a>]  Like, you know these customers like I give them extra service by like remembering their names having porn start signing poster

[<a id="00-43-50">00:43:50</a>]  Bring them back to Washington and I never I never talked about this but in uniform is the only time

[<a id="00-43-56">00:43:56</a>]  When I watched porn with other dudes. Yeah, I have a quick question. Did you also do comedy in Afghanistan?

[<a id="00-44-03">00:44:03</a>]  We were thinking about talking but it was little I don't know we just gonna make it happen, but I don't know if I

[<a id="00-44-11">00:44:11</a>]  Would hear this much when I was hanging out with all the expats in

[<a id="00-44-14">00:44:14</a>]  2012 2013

[<a id="00-44-17">00:44:17</a>]  2019 when I was in the porn stories, they couldn't stop laughing

[<a id="00-44-22">00:44:22</a>]  Because they have dark humor but they love hang on expats living in Afghanistan, yeah

[<a id="00-44-27">00:44:27</a>]  NGO they could be

[<a id="00-44-31">00:44:31</a>]  Spies business people, but they are not in the army bases there. No, they're in city in Kabul

[<a id="00-44-40">00:44:40</a>]  Fucking hell. Yeah, that's why when I showed up

[<a id="00-44-44">00:44:44</a>]  They thought I was fine because nobody believed like where you do stand-up comedy and do medical testing and you're a comic and pornography

[<a id="00-44-51">00:44:51</a>]  None of this sounds like just like no way. We don't believe it. You're spying, you know

[<a id="00-44-55">00:44:55</a>]  Spy seem more believable than all the other bullshit idea which country for though

[<a id="00-45-01">00:45:01</a>]  So that's that yeah

[<a id="00-45-10">00:45:10</a>]  So those kind of dark yellow humor is necessary because the people that complain they most likely have easy life

[<a id="00-45-17">00:45:17</a>]  But the people that appreciate those humor, they're they're doing stuff like life and death all the fucking time

[<a id="00-45-22">00:45:22</a>]  They don't have time to be fucking woke

[<a id="00-45-25">00:45:25</a>]  They're not know we

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  This is these guys are fighting fucking wars, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-45-31">00:45:31</a>]  They're not gonna be warned about tranny jokes because I said that but it's not just that and this is the aesthetic of like

[<a id="00-45-36">00:45:36</a>]  Of like army or like putting yourself into that sort of situation. I served in the Swiss army, which

[<a id="00-45-41">00:45:41</a>]  Isn't really engaged in anything really nobody's still something. It's still yes, but if you are

[<a id="00-45-47">00:45:47</a>]  If you're spending a week on week, yeah with just the boys it is not good energy for any society

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  It is homoerotic at best but vile at the worst and I literally have this memory

[<a id="00-46-04">00:46:04</a>]  one of our

[<a id="00-46-07">00:46:07</a>]  Staff sergeants just go like boys boys boys

[<a id="00-46-11">00:46:11</a>]  Come to my office and it was like there was like four of us

[<a id="00-46-15">00:46:15</a>]  I was I

[<a id="00-46-18">00:46:18</a>]  was a dispatcher at the time

[<a id="00-46-20">00:46:20</a>]  and we were

[<a id="00-46-22">00:46:22</a>]  Coordinating logistics doesn't mind doesn't matter but there was there was a bunch of us. We were

[<a id="00-46-27">00:46:27</a>]  Looking after other guys in the field. Yeah, we have office jobs. Yeah, so this this staff sergeant is like boys come over come over

[<a id="00-46-35">00:46:35</a>]  it's like and his laptop is open and there's just this the wildest porn running like

[<a id="00-46-42">00:46:42</a>]  Full-screen just there. It's like guys his charge of you guys. He's showing you porn

[<a id="00-46-46">00:46:46</a>]  he's in charge of us and he's showing his porn and he just goes like

[<a id="00-46-49">00:46:49</a>]  Guys, I just want to say this this should win an Oscar watch this and he hits the spacebar

[<a id="00-46-56">00:46:56</a>]  And there's just the most wild anal scene that I have seen up until this point

[<a id="00-47-03">00:47:03</a>]  This Oscar so he sits in at the desk

[<a id="00-47-07">00:47:07</a>]  Watching this there's four of us standing behind him goes like yeah, that's that's pretty good

[<a id="00-47-13">00:47:13</a>]  But then I mean, it's really a thing

[<a id="00-47-19">00:47:19</a>]  It's like the CIA is trying to figure out how to control or they need to if they all work in porn

[<a id="00-47-26">00:47:26</a>]  Yeah, or the diplomatic service same again. You say like I represent America and I work for evil angel

[<a id="00-47-34">00:47:34</a>]  Yeah, like everyone did. Do you know how many problems we could fix with?

[<a id="00-47-37">00:47:37</a>]  Like I've heard like I used to put like messages in the porn movies and things like that

[<a id="00-47-44">00:47:44</a>]  But stop Simon what now?

[<a id="00-47-46">00:47:46</a>]  That they would they would put messages in porn and deliver to each other sending online and things like that

[<a id="00-47-54">00:47:54</a>]  No, this is true. So you did that?

[<a id="00-47-56">00:47:56</a>]  Well, it was that

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  Wow, did I did I

[<a id="00-48-02">00:48:02</a>]  Did I talk about this? I

[<a id="00-48-04">00:48:04</a>]  Can't tell which starts at all, but like somebody asked me what you like after doing all so many movies

[<a id="00-48-09">00:48:09</a>]  Do you used to have fantasy? Have I talked about that?

[<a id="00-48-11">00:48:11</a>]  No on go

[<a id="00-48-14">00:48:14</a>]  Well, I told him like well, of course recently I told you my fetish is like girls showing up in time

[<a id="00-48-20">00:48:20</a>]  you don't talk and I start being bitch, but

[<a id="00-48-24">00:48:24</a>]  Dude

[<a id="00-48-26">00:48:26</a>]  Beyond time. Yeah

[<a id="00-48-28">00:48:28</a>]  You don't have to take your clothes

[<a id="00-48-30">00:48:30</a>]  Just show up on time. Shut the fuck up. Yeah, exactly you go. Would you want to meet then?

[<a id="00-48-35">00:48:35</a>]  Yes, and then they actually arrive on time. Oh, yes

[<a id="00-48-38">00:48:38</a>]  Yes

[<a id="00-48-41">00:48:41</a>]  Fantasy I told like 10 12 years ago was I was telling the audience like I should have thought I should have said this story

[<a id="00-48-46">00:48:46</a>]  Yes, so when when when the u.s. Marines and Navy CEOs killed bin Laden, you know about about Pakistan

[<a id="00-48-53">00:48:53</a>]  They killed him took his body, but they also found a bunch of porno in his to laptop to laptop and hard drive and

[<a id="00-49-02">00:49:02</a>]  the guy who shot him claimed like they went to closet they found bunch of VHS and DVDs and also a

[<a id="00-49-07">00:49:07</a>]  Laptop and heart, you know, I remember this story. So my fantasy is that I prayed to God one of the movie

[<a id="00-49-14">00:49:14</a>]  He was watching is the movie I worked on

[<a id="00-49-16">00:49:16</a>]  And my movie is so good as was he as he's jacking after my movie

[<a id="00-49-22">00:49:22</a>]  He doesn't even hear the Navy Seals walking up the stair to kill him. Yeah, and then

[<a id="00-49-26">00:49:26</a>]  They shoot him kill him and you know, and my movie has some contributing factor of killing bit long

[<a id="00-49-35">00:49:35</a>]  That was my fantasy, right?

[<a id="00-49-37">00:49:37</a>]  but when I say stuff like this like military people and I

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  Send DVDs and stuff like that

[<a id="00-49-44">00:49:44</a>]  They really appreciate it, you know

[<a id="00-49-45">00:49:45</a>]  Because a lot of times they don't follow politics like they don't even they still don't know why they went to

[<a id="00-49-50">00:49:50</a>]  Iraq and Afghanistan. No, and most of those guys are young like army boys are between 19 and

[<a id="00-49-56">00:49:56</a>]  25 yeah

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  18 to 25. Yeah. Yeah 18 to 25 some of them are 16

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  No, sometimes they're underage, but if the parents give them permission to do what they were allowed, but it's fucking nuts

[<a id="00-50-13">00:50:13</a>]  Yeah, so but this is exactly what happens and in generation kill actually I find that quite nice because they treat

[<a id="00-50-21">00:50:21</a>]  Jocks magazine. Yes as as currency. Yes, and this is the thing

[<a id="00-50-26">00:50:26</a>]  Armies all over world soldiers all over the world. It's not US Army. It is every soldier all over the world

[<a id="00-50-34">00:50:34</a>]  It's the same fucking stupid cunt. It's just a young lad. Yeah horny as fuck giving a gun and

[<a id="00-50-41">00:50:41</a>]  Harry was successfully making coffee. There's not a coffee. There's a tea, but I'll take a

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  Take a cup

[<a id="00-50-50">00:50:50</a>]  No, no, but my man magazine wait wait wait, that's good. I want to I want to finish that point then. All right, so

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  Soldiers all over the world are the same person. Yes, horny young men

[<a id="00-51-05">00:51:05</a>]  Yes, given a gun doing something stupid that they don't really understand

[<a id="00-51-10">00:51:10</a>]  But in the end there is no girls around

[<a id="00-51-14">00:51:14</a>]  So what you do is you check off in the fucking toilet stall and you shared the porn

[<a id="00-51-19">00:51:19</a>]  That's what you do. And those man isn't very very part of popular. Look, I know young man the pervert ladies

[<a id="00-51-27">00:51:27</a>]  You want to call them pervert? That's fine, too

[<a id="00-51-29">00:51:29</a>]  But there's also other factor too

[<a id="00-51-32">00:51:32</a>]  They're young kids from audible America

[<a id="00-51-36">00:51:36</a>]  Iowa, Nebraska, Texas

[<a id="00-51-39">00:51:39</a>]  They're go they're sent to places because they join most of the time because they have little to no opportunities

[<a id="00-51-44">00:51:44</a>]  But it's not just like a perverted jack-in-the-box it's like they're scared they might die

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  To to to have prospect to be a some sweetheart

[<a id="00-51-54">00:51:54</a>]  You know what? I mean? I'd rather it's like a human thing

[<a id="00-51-58">00:51:58</a>]  But I'd rather have a good wank before going into a war zone than a good shit

[<a id="00-52-03">00:52:03</a>]  Yes, if Bush comes to shop, you know what I mean? It's

[<a id="00-52-06">00:52:06</a>]  But they're they're terrified man, and when I talk to them, they put brave heart, but and you know, they will keep fighting for their

[<a id="00-52-13">00:52:13</a>]  Buddies in the same unit, but believe me it's still scary. I mean I can't imagine the terror

[<a id="00-52-21">00:52:21</a>]  One of the greatest like one of the great statistics I ever heard. Yeah in World War one

[<a id="00-52-27">00:52:27</a>]  Less than 20% of the soldiers on each side were actually shooting to kill

[<a id="00-52-33">00:52:33</a>]  yeah now and and because of that what it actually led to was a

[<a id="00-52-39">00:52:39</a>]  Major upgrade in military training to brainwash people to kill. Yes

[<a id="00-52-44">00:52:44</a>]  Because they're like fuck half of like less than 20% of our soldiers actually trying to kill the guys on the other side

[<a id="00-52-51">00:52:51</a>]  Most people were shooting above the heads of the enemy that tells you something

[<a id="00-52-55">00:52:55</a>]  fundamentally positive about humanity and

[<a id="00-53-00">00:53:00</a>]  It just makes me this is the stuff that makes me a revolutionary is

[<a id="00-53-04">00:53:04</a>]  We just need to kill a bunch of powerful people and then most of the problems in this planet go away

[<a id="00-53-10">00:53:10</a>]  Now we're officially cancelled from YouTube. No, I mean we can edit this but whatever it's just like I feel conflicted

[<a id="00-53-17">00:53:17</a>]  What you I know what you're saying and you know, I know what you're saying. You're about understanding. I'm also about solutions because I'm half German

[<a id="00-53-24">00:53:24</a>]  I I understand what you're saying as long as you're not talking about final solutions because then it becomes fucking gnarly. I know what you're saying

[<a id="00-53-31">00:53:31</a>]  And I might be contradicting what I'm saying

[<a id="00-53-35">00:53:35</a>]  We have to learn to manage these people with these tendencies and doing terrible things

[<a id="00-53-40">00:53:40</a>]  But the problem is there are some useful psychopath, you know

[<a id="00-53-44">00:53:44</a>]  Yeah, people who don't pack and they're kind of cold and ruthless like so for example brain surgeon

[<a id="00-53-50">00:53:50</a>]  Yeah, he's a fucking arrogant piece of shit peach tree everybody fucking shitty, but he's able to his job because he's so fucking arrogant

[<a id="00-53-57">00:53:57</a>]  Thank God he's so good at doing this difficult procedures. Yeah, or you have psychopathic

[<a id="00-54-01">00:54:01</a>]  F-15 pilot he's terrible. He's a terrible father. He cheats. He's a scumbag this and that but he's an absolute killer

[<a id="00-54-10">00:54:10</a>]  Absolute killer and you there's a place for people like that

[<a id="00-54-13">00:54:13</a>]  And I think it's not like your son asked me

[<a id="00-54-16">00:54:16</a>]  Is there any way ever to end or any rape and like?

[<a id="00-54-20">00:54:20</a>]  It's like asking me. Is there any way to completely eliminate all crimes or crimes?

[<a id="00-54-25">00:54:25</a>]  We don't live in utopia and we can learn to manage you and lower it

[<a id="00-54-30">00:54:30</a>]  We create a condition where people would feel less inclined to commit crimes and stuff like that

[<a id="00-54-34">00:54:34</a>]  But I don't think that's realistic either

[<a id="00-54-36">00:54:36</a>]  So what I'm saying is like we need to educate young people about fantasy and things like that and learn to live with these people

[<a id="00-54-43">00:54:43</a>]  But I mean there is time places for I mean Tom Brady and Michael Jones

[<a id="00-54-48">00:54:48</a>]  They're psychopaths while they're playing the game absolute sacrifice and there are

[<a id="00-54-52">00:54:52</a>]  Wall Street guys, they're psychopathic, but they're good at what they do. You know what I mean? So what?

[<a id="00-54-58">00:54:58</a>]  How much do you tolerate?

[<a id="00-55-01">00:55:01</a>]  Psychopathy without not hurting a lot of people I dead. I don't know. I don't know how to Michael Michael Jordan

[<a id="00-55-07">00:55:07</a>]  You know what? I'm trying to say. Yeah, exactly the Michael Jordan example. Actually, I find quite pertinent on this one because

[<a id="00-55-13">00:55:13</a>]  Looking at his story

[<a id="00-55-15">00:55:15</a>]  Basketball was kind of a sideshow

[<a id="00-55-18">00:55:18</a>]  He was great at basketball and that's how he made his money. Yeah, but ultimately he's a private equity investor

[<a id="00-55-26">00:55:26</a>]  And he's a killer in the business. Yeah, he's a killer

[<a id="00-55-30">00:55:30</a>]  Yes, as an investor and the majority of his money he made through investments. Yeah, not through basketball

[<a id="00-55-38">00:55:38</a>]  That I didn't figure that's fascinating because I just saw whatever the movie with about the trainers and

[<a id="00-55-44">00:55:44</a>]  They make it seem like his wife is the smart business. Hey mother. Oh the mother. Yes. Yeah

[<a id="00-55-51">00:55:51</a>]  But you know, what's funny is that magic Johnson have this great personality and like a likable guy, but I think

[<a id="00-55-58">00:55:58</a>]  He's probably equally if he's an economist through and through

[<a id="00-56-03">00:56:03</a>]  but he had to be good but

[<a id="00-56-08">00:56:08</a>]  But so did but man hang out with him when he got he

[<a id="00-56-12">00:56:12</a>]  Magic chance have smile and personable and things like that, but I don't think it's like a nice guy letting him push it around

[<a id="00-56-17">00:56:17</a>]  You know, I mean, I heard you you motherfucker

[<a id="00-56-21">00:56:21</a>]  Yeah, so

[<a id="00-56-27">00:56:27</a>]  You got

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  Like in Japan, you know, I grow up with Yakuza and in my western effort, how could you have like legalized mob like well

[<a id="00-56-38">00:56:38</a>]  What would you rather have?

[<a id="00-56-40">00:56:40</a>]  Disorganized psychopath or organized one in groups. So, you know, well exactly we still have the same thing. They're called policemen over here

[<a id="00-56-47">00:56:47</a>]  And these people need a job. It's

[<a id="00-56-50">00:56:50</a>]  Have you seen just the cops in Zurich?

[<a id="00-56-53">00:56:53</a>]  hot women

[<a id="00-56-56">00:56:56</a>]  There are nothing compared to the cops in America though in terms of the worst scenario, I'm sure I'm sure they don't they're not perfect

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  But I'm just saying they have worse scenario when American cops do something horrible versus what you guys do worse

[<a id="00-57-10">00:57:10</a>]  I think they're still gonna be better. No, but you don't educate your fuckers. That's the other problem

[<a id="00-57-21">00:57:21</a>]  - we fucking this is your uniform and then go and shoot black people. Yeah, that's kind of what you guys do - Swiss details

[<a id="00-57-29">00:57:29</a>]  about the police, okay as an outsider and number one is that they

[<a id="00-57-32">00:57:32</a>]  every

[<a id="00-57-34">00:57:34</a>]  30% of the police on the street are hot blonde women and it's they're insanely hot

[<a id="00-57-40">00:57:40</a>]  There's some of it like model level homeless. Yes, that's a detail

[<a id="00-57-44">00:57:44</a>]  The other thing is is that the Swiss police I believe I don't know where I got this from

[<a id="00-57-50">00:57:50</a>]  Were trained by the New York police force

[<a id="00-57-53">00:57:53</a>]  So if you look at the gear that they say Rick is very cast

[<a id="00-57-56">00:57:56</a>]  You know at least in Zurich and Zurich so in this city, they were trained by the police in New York

[<a id="00-58-01">00:58:01</a>]  They got way too much gear. They're ready to go and there's nothing happening

[<a id="00-58-06">00:58:06</a>]  Yeah, hilarious, but they have itchy trigger fingers like motherfuckers. Yeah, and whatever so first of May

[<a id="00-58-12">00:58:12</a>]  Stones are thrown in Switzerland. That's the rule. So first I mean first of May is

[<a id="00-58-19">00:58:19</a>]  It's Labor Day Labor Day Labor Day the big Labor Day demonstrations

[<a id="00-58-24">00:58:24</a>]  They happen every first of May and without fail because it's May Day. Yeah, yeah communist day or whatever

[<a id="00-58-30">00:58:30</a>]  Yeah, so exactly and in Switzerland, especially in Zurich. It's really bad. Yeah, it's mostly rich kids

[<a id="00-58-37">00:58:37</a>]  No, it's mostly

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  Italians that travel here for the first of May also true

[<a id="00-58-44">00:58:44</a>]  So there is a community in Europe that travels for these sort of celebrations. Let's call it and

[<a id="00-58-50">00:58:50</a>]  The police in Zurich wait for that day

[<a id="00-58-54">00:58:54</a>]  So did they have to have the water cannons they have like the the trucks that come around. I was in London in 2012

[<a id="00-59-01">00:59:01</a>]  Let me guess it's it's their Super Bowl. It's actually

[<a id="00-59-04">00:59:04</a>]  100% I was in London in 2012 when the riots happened and

[<a id="00-59-08">00:59:08</a>]  It was it was crazy where you can see you look across London

[<a id="00-59-13">00:59:13</a>]  And there's just like pi pillars of smoke coming up from every corner of the city

[<a id="00-59-19">00:59:19</a>]  Yeah, and you suddenly didn't know it's like can we go to that restaurant? Sorry because I'm I'm that guy

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  It's the most middle-class conversation he has like well the city is on fire, but can we still have our car I

[<a id="00-59-40">00:59:40</a>]  Don't want to suggest which pub is safe. I don't want to suggest the cops are bad in America

[<a id="00-59-44">00:59:44</a>]  They're vast majority is a company good men and women

[<a id="00-59-48">00:59:48</a>]  Absolutely, and they're a situation the poorly trained or racist or whatever terrible things that happen to black folks

[<a id="00-59-55">00:59:55</a>]  So their worst scenario if you take those samples, I don't know that's still comfortable what happened in Switzerland

[<a id="01-00-02">01:00:02</a>]  That's all no, but absolutely it isn't but this is the point. I'm trying to make so

[<a id="01-00-07">01:00:07</a>]  When when I'm I'm in London in 2012 the riots are happening

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  Yeah, and it's bananas like you see it on the television screen how people are looting and there there's fires everywhere in Zurich

[<a id="01-00-19">01:00:19</a>]  No, this is in London. Oh

[<a id="01-00-21">01:00:21</a>]  So this is my point. Yes, I know how the Swiss cops react to the new thing. Yeah, and it's

[<a id="01-00-28">01:00:28</a>]  fucking vicious

[<a id="01-00-30">01:00:30</a>]  Like they go after the bastards in a fucking heartbeat it but is it also true because they get so little opportunity to do

[<a id="01-00-37">01:00:37</a>]  That's exactly right. I say that's exactly they're ready to go and

[<a id="01-00-41">01:00:41</a>]  There's there's all the tear gas in the world. Yeah that you can ever buy because we have the fucking money

[<a id="01-00-47">01:00:47</a>]  So they have all the shit

[<a id="01-00-49">01:00:49</a>]  I see and they have all the water cannons and they did push them all together and then it's it's a fucking nightmare

[<a id="01-00-58">01:00:58</a>]  I went to school in a place. That was kind of lefty in in a place called national tell

[<a id="01-01-04">01:01:04</a>]  He's a high school college. That was

[<a id="01-01-06">01:01:06</a>]  High in between like a baccalaureate it's it's like yeah after high school, so I

[<a id="01-01-15">01:01:15</a>]  Have friends that came to school after demonstrations with proper like

[<a id="01-01-23">01:01:23</a>]  Their their chest was shot to shit from rubber bullets. Oh, and that wasn't that was a Saturday

[<a id="01-01-29">01:01:29</a>]  That's a Saturday so these guys they they are fucking going for it

[<a id="01-01-35">01:01:35</a>]  Yeah, and I was just looking at the London Police Department at that point is like what the fuck are you on about? Yeah

[<a id="01-01-41">01:01:41</a>]  They didn't know how to

[<a id="01-01-44">01:01:44</a>]  De-escalation do you want to de-escalate when someone throws a fucking Molotov cocktail? Yeah, really I

[<a id="01-01-52">01:01:52</a>]  Mean, I mean, that's yeah, I mean it's also thing the English for the English police force when I was

[<a id="01-01-58">01:01:58</a>]  When I would live there

[<a id="01-02-00">01:02:00</a>]  The default level what but you go to the Notting Hill Carnival and the police are dancing in the thing

[<a id="01-02-07">01:02:07</a>]  It's like and it was cool, but it's nothing hell like a nice area in London beautiful

[<a id="01-02-12">01:02:12</a>]  Yeah, but there's nothing your carnival. It's a scar festival. It's all okay. It's just like

[<a id="01-02-18">01:02:18</a>]  between

[<a id="01-02-22">01:02:22</a>]  Jamaican and and rap and a bunch of other music. Can I do something?

[<a id="01-02-26">01:02:26</a>]  When black people from overseas visit United States, especially like English black people cop kind of

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  Become ease, you know, cuz they just they sound such a gentleman like a proper upper-class people, you know

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  Like I like you can't hit five people that talk like that. There's some so proper

[<a id="01-02-49">01:02:49</a>]  But get OS people get always the bad worst treatment, but that's a that's a crazy thing like the power of your voice

[<a id="01-02-56">01:02:56</a>]  Yeah, because wait, isn't that what June is about?

[<a id="01-03-00">01:03:00</a>]  Yeah, literally, I really like the way black people London talk. It's like it's so cool. Like it's so proper

[<a id="01-03-08">01:03:08</a>]  But it's you know, I'm talking about it. Just like the son of a

[<a id="01-03-11">01:03:11</a>]  If like a policeman grabs your arm, you're like, yeah, you're like yo get the fuck on me. This is like

[<a id="01-03-18">01:03:18</a>]  Well, how dare you put your your hand? Yes fingers upon me

[<a id="01-03-23">01:03:23</a>]  That is immediately because there's an implied layer of I have a fucking army that of lawyers

[<a id="01-03-29">01:03:29</a>]  They're gonna come and fuck you up if you do. I also love when the black people speak French

[<a id="01-03-33">01:03:33</a>]  It's really sexy. But the one that makes me laugh when when when black people speak German the language of area

[<a id="01-03-40">01:03:40</a>]  It's very confusing

[<a id="01-03-44">01:03:44</a>]  Wow

[<a id="01-03-45">01:03:45</a>]  We dug a hole did you because when I hit when I hear black people speak Japanese, they're so sweet. What is so nice

[<a id="01-03-52">01:03:52</a>]  What's your opinion on German porn? Like what's the German country?

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  That's that's it's misleading because what they do is they picked all the extreme stop saying that's all they watch was just misleading

[<a id="01-04-04">01:04:04</a>]  Just like Japanese that there's plenty on that the regular porn that they don't really talk about

[<a id="01-04-09">01:04:09</a>]  it's kind of like, you know when they interview like

[<a id="01-04-11">01:04:11</a>]  when they say like wow, you know like

[<a id="01-04-14">01:04:14</a>]  nine out of ten

[<a id="01-04-16">01:04:16</a>]  Doctors recommend this medication, but what happens they interview like hundred doctors

[<a id="01-04-20">01:04:20</a>]  They just take this block and said nine out of ten. It's very yeah

[<a id="01-04-23">01:04:23</a>]  So when they say German porn they pick this corner of the weird stuff and that's all the Germans make it's misleading

[<a id="01-04-29">01:04:29</a>]  And they do it's basically that the sample is always Berlin

[<a id="01-04-32">01:04:32</a>]  Yeah, they just kind of mislead people, you know, I mean believe me America makes a lot of weird shit to you

[<a id="01-04-38">01:04:38</a>]  Yeah, I would describe German porn as it's it's it's people that you don't want to watch having sex doing extra

[<a id="01-04-46">01:04:46</a>]  That's not true. No, I mean

[<a id="01-04-48">01:04:48</a>]  I've seen plenty of like wow

[<a id="01-04-50">01:04:50</a>]  Really because they're gonna say like like you have to show like the American professional

[<a id="01-04-55">01:04:55</a>]  Yeah, there's a commitment to but there's a lot of amateur. I mean amateur shit, too, you know, but

[<a id="01-05-01">01:05:01</a>]  Like I told you before

[<a id="01-05-04">01:05:04</a>]  Branded took me like a literally the shit videos where they're shitting on people, you know, so I went

[<a id="01-05-09">01:05:09</a>]  Tuesdays and

[<a id="01-05-12">01:05:12</a>]  And they were so different from Japanese shit porn

[<a id="01-05-16">01:05:16</a>]  Because Japanese like I told you before Japanese like shit that is smooth to kind of bounce off your chest

[<a id="01-05-21">01:05:21</a>]  Where's Germans like there's chunky monkey to kind of stick on your body. You know what I mean?

[<a id="01-05-25">01:05:25</a>]  Okay

[<a id="01-05-27">01:05:27</a>]  Zag a zag into a dark place. So I listened to some of Yoshi didn't put cut. Oh, no

[<a id="01-05-34">01:05:34</a>]  You don't do that. Why why I should have never done them. Why?

[<a id="01-05-41">01:05:41</a>]  So I heard Brandon on that podcast. Oh god, rest in peace. Oh, why did you listen to that one?

[<a id="01-05-49">01:05:49</a>]  I just began from number one and he was on he was on a few of the early episodes. He's great. He's wonderful

[<a id="01-05-55">01:05:55</a>]  So who would you be willing to tell us about Brandon?

[<a id="01-05-58">01:05:58</a>]  What's the story of Brandon Brandon was somebody I made first year in the porn convention and I recognized him

[<a id="01-06-04">01:06:04</a>]  But he was the first friend I made that became very close to you and in 2019. He killed himself

[<a id="01-06-08">01:06:08</a>]  Do you know why?

[<a id="01-06-12">01:06:12</a>]  I had a I'm not gonna mention who but I had a conversation with somebody but Brandon did tell me three four years

[<a id="01-06-17">01:06:17</a>]  when he was dating this girl from

[<a id="01-06-20">01:06:20</a>]  Ireland like

[<a id="01-06-22">01:06:22</a>]  Hahaha, I think once I've run out of money, she's gonna take my kid away and see me again. Well, that's exactly what happened

[<a id="01-06-30">01:06:30</a>]  Wow, I

[<a id="01-06-35">01:06:35</a>]  Mean I mean did I tell you did I tell you that was worth it? No, no, no, but do you remember the story?

[<a id="01-06-41">01:06:41</a>]  I told you I

[<a id="01-06-43">01:06:43</a>]  Think I told you one of you today was just the one didn't I where I

[<a id="01-06-48">01:06:48</a>]  I think I was I think I was um, I can't remember it was stuck someplace in San Diego

[<a id="01-06-54">01:06:54</a>]  I'm trying to drive back

[<a id="01-06-58">01:06:58</a>]  LA for some reason and

[<a id="01-07-00">01:07:00</a>]  Traffic is terrible. So I pulled over into movie theater and then I've seen everything except ratatouille. So I watched that and

[<a id="01-07-08">01:07:08</a>]  then

[<a id="01-07-11">01:07:11</a>]  It's great Pixar movie or whatever at the tail end of it

[<a id="01-07-14">01:07:14</a>]  There was this montage where one of the bad character

[<a id="01-07-19">01:07:19</a>]  somebody mean

[<a id="01-07-22">01:07:22</a>]  The food and the taste and smell reminding him childhood and he started thinking about his dad and then when I saw that it kind

[<a id="01-07-30">01:07:30</a>]  of hit me hard because I was taking my dad to you and then I didn't realize I

[<a id="01-07-34">01:07:34</a>]  Never as I start crying. Well something weird happened. There was a little boy sitting next to me saw me crying

[<a id="01-07-41">01:07:41</a>]  So he touched my hands. Everything's gonna be okay. Jesus Christ. I don't need to have a child touching my hand

[<a id="01-07-46">01:07:46</a>]  Can you imagine if the dad see like there's a guy my son is touching somebody?

[<a id="01-07-52">01:07:52</a>]  Like some Asian guy's hand and they did he find out later. He worked for porn. Is that what you want?

[<a id="01-07-58">01:07:58</a>]  So I kind of freaked out and told Brandon about it and afterwards, you know

[<a id="01-08-03">01:08:03</a>]  I don't really him never talked about that

[<a id="01-08-06">01:08:06</a>]  But when you work in porn all the time watching shit all the time you get suck a time watching fucking porn

[<a id="01-08-11">01:08:11</a>]  You know what? I mean?

[<a id="01-08-13">01:08:13</a>]  You really want to see something sweet and gentle and we used to go watch Pixar movies, you know

[<a id="01-08-18">01:08:18</a>]  So isn't it weird like two porn guys?

[<a id="01-08-20">01:08:20</a>]  Watching Pixar movies now because those movies especially like Toy Story 1 2 and fucking number 3

[<a id="01-08-27">01:08:27</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="01-08-31">01:08:31</a>]  We get stuff from those things that you can't get it from porn. I mean we care about each other in porn

[<a id="01-08-36">01:08:36</a>]  but you know, it's just

[<a id="01-08-38">01:08:38</a>]  Have you seen Toy Story 3?

[<a id="01-08-40">01:08:40</a>]  Probably fucking it's a tearjerker man, it's just make you cry and

[<a id="01-08-46">01:08:46</a>]  So Brandon was like that and he was my closest friend and

[<a id="01-08-52">01:08:52</a>]  He we watch so much Pixar movie every time they're out like he'll do that gangbang and then after where we go see Pixar

[<a id="01-08-59">01:08:59</a>]  Movie or whatever. We watched so many of it by the time he had a kid

[<a id="01-09-03">01:09:03</a>]  He knew all the books to read to her and although it was like Pixar movie to watch with her and whatever issue

[<a id="01-09-08">01:09:08</a>]  He had about sex and women or whatever. I think those Pixar movie and having a kid

[<a id="01-09-13">01:09:13</a>]  Even though he wasn't like rich or anything like that. I think it put him in a good place

[<a id="01-09-18">01:09:18</a>]  Mm-hmm, you know like you have kids no matter how much difficult thing can happen to you in life

[<a id="01-09-23">01:09:23</a>]  You look at your kids and your kids are wonderful. I'm sure because your son threw me to the point

[<a id="01-09-28">01:09:28</a>]  It's something to give you a purpose, right?

[<a id="01-09-31">01:09:31</a>]  Well soon as the money run out and this lady this is allegedly what I heard from a couple people

[<a id="01-09-36">01:09:36</a>]  When this Pixar shit watching books raising a little girl

[<a id="01-09-42">01:09:42</a>]  Made him happier and when that fucking kid is taken away from you it's end of the world, you know, and I think

[<a id="01-09-51">01:09:51</a>]  Sometime when something happened where you just can't deal it with it

[<a id="01-09-55">01:09:55</a>]  You all you do is you want to kill yourself, but if you could have just held on for that 15 20 30 minutes

[<a id="01-10-00">01:10:00</a>]  Just stay calm

[<a id="01-10-02">01:10:02</a>]  Maybe you could withstand but yeah, I just I can't imagine losing a kid. I don't have a kid, you know

[<a id="01-10-07">01:10:07</a>]  Yeah, that's I mean I played that scenario through a little bit in my head. It's unimaginable

[<a id="01-10-14">01:10:14</a>]  It's unimaginable. Yeah, I've been very lucky by two healthy kids

[<a id="01-10-18">01:10:18</a>]  And I mean one thing is like you see parents with kids that are disabled and you have to deal with that for life

[<a id="01-10-25">01:10:25</a>]  But if you lost one, but so I mean so you knew Brandon for like 10 years

[<a id="01-10-30">01:10:30</a>]  No, no. No, I know him from 1999 and then he died in 2019 20 years

[<a id="01-10-35">01:10:35</a>]  He's the closest we used to go traveling stuff going museums, which watch a lot of movies and stuff

[<a id="01-10-40">01:10:40</a>]  But he does a lot of harsh hard physical shit, you know

[<a id="01-10-45">01:10:45</a>]  He's he's one of his famous one is slap happy when the slap the shit out of girls face and fuck them, you know, fuck's sake

[<a id="01-10-51">01:10:51</a>]  He doesn't hate women because afterwards when he's dating them, he's always that passive one

[<a id="01-10-56">01:10:56</a>]  He have this attractive porn gurus just pushing him around

[<a id="01-10-59">01:10:59</a>]  He's really not good at with that

[<a id="01-11-01">01:11:01</a>]  But when it comes to fucking, you know, he's in total control just like we are in control when we do shows

[<a id="01-11-06">01:11:06</a>]  Okay, you fuck say I mean, here's the thing in me being an idiot like can I ask them that before you ask?

[<a id="01-11-14">01:11:14</a>]  How did you like to see any of you with Brandon?

[<a id="01-11-17">01:11:17</a>]  Or was it the kind of dumb

[<a id="01-11-22">01:11:22</a>]  Oh

[<a id="01-11-24">01:11:24</a>]  Do you remember how much how much did you listen to here's what I got through the first three episodes

[<a id="01-11-30">01:11:30</a>]  I would love to oh wow, you're this that many. Yeah. Yeah, and

[<a id="01-11-33">01:11:33</a>]  But his his it okay it reminded me two things number one is

[<a id="01-11-43">01:11:43</a>]  When people are talking like we're doing a good job of like balancing between us

[<a id="01-11-50">01:11:50</a>]  You know that you're the focus of this conversation

[<a id="01-11-52">01:11:52</a>]  No one is when you get a bunch of retards on with my friends. Yeah

[<a id="01-11-57">01:11:57</a>]  One person will usually dominate the conversation all that anyone else talks

[<a id="01-12-02">01:12:02</a>]  okay, and and on on this podcast was annoying me is

[<a id="01-12-07">01:12:07</a>]  The the female porn stars like oh, this is I've got attention. They may not shut the fuck up

[<a id="01-12-13">01:12:13</a>]  It wasn't me Brandon in the porn girl

[<a id="01-12-16">01:12:16</a>]  Yeah, I don't remember. I don't remember anything. I don't remember any of this one of them was kind of funny, but it's just like

[<a id="01-12-22">01:12:22</a>]  like there was one point you answer a really interesting question and then

[<a id="01-12-28">01:12:28</a>]  Someone else said some and then ADHD and it's like she avoided answering

[<a id="01-12-33">01:12:33</a>]  Yeah question and that shit drives me nuts because it's just like it's like comedians at the moment you get into anything real

[<a id="01-12-41">01:12:41</a>]  They crack a joke and kill the so I was evasive action. I find it a little bit irritating

[<a id="01-12-47">01:12:47</a>]  But but there was something there. Yeah, and and

[<a id="01-12-50">01:12:50</a>]  like Brandon

[<a id="01-12-53">01:12:53</a>]  He's a very thoughtful guy. He really was. Oh, I mean, I didn't I didn't get that much out of what was it?

[<a id="01-12-59">01:12:59</a>]  So tell them tell us more about Brandon. What's like his what's what's his story if you're willing to share?

[<a id="01-13-04">01:13:04</a>]  No, he was he was probably the most honest person. I work with where did he come from like he's American

[<a id="01-13-10">01:13:10</a>]  No, he's Canadian. He's from Calgary if I remember, right? Okay, and I

[<a id="01-13-15">01:13:15</a>]  Got like him in this black

[<a id="01-13-18">01:13:18</a>]  Performing name sledgehammer Malcolm

[<a id="01-13-21">01:13:21</a>]  Yeah cops killed him about 10-11 years ago, but he he was such a gentle guy sweet guy man

[<a id="01-13-32">01:13:32</a>]  He was a wonderful guy I

[<a id="01-13-36">01:13:36</a>]  Love I don't I can't think of one time when I made a black person porn

[<a id="01-13-40">01:13:40</a>]  They're just cool people, you know because think about it your black person in America

[<a id="01-13-45">01:13:45</a>]  So there's like a racial stuff going but within black community

[<a id="01-13-47">01:13:47</a>]  They don't like that shit because a lot of black people are religious people. So they're like minority about minority

[<a id="01-13-53">01:13:53</a>]  You know I'm saying so and there's such a sweet people man. And

[<a id="01-13-56">01:13:56</a>]  That's why

[<a id="01-14-00">01:14:00</a>]  So you ready? That's why when Brandon died or sledgehammer and I even though I didn't know him

[<a id="01-14-07">01:14:07</a>]  I was sad for George Floyd. I don't know if you know he did porn. I don't know if you knew that

[<a id="01-14-11">01:14:11</a>]  yeah, they call him Houston Floyd and

[<a id="01-14-14">01:14:14</a>]  It's one of the reason why?

[<a id="01-14-17">01:14:17</a>]  avian got in trouble because

[<a id="01-14-20">01:14:20</a>]  One of the reporters said something like rest in peace George Floyd, you know fellow whatever

[<a id="01-14-25">01:14:25</a>]  Colleague did porn or whatever and a lot of black and white activists that you guys are fucking motherfucker

[<a id="01-14-31">01:14:31</a>]  They thought we're being disrespectful that look man. I I'm pro porn and he is one of our colleague

[<a id="01-14-37">01:14:37</a>]  But they didn't take it that way

[<a id="01-14-39">01:14:39</a>]  so something about the George Floyd thing with porn was mentioned where it led to no more awards for

[<a id="01-14-46">01:14:46</a>]  You know racial porn categories because they see that's why are you shitting? No

[<a id="01-14-51">01:14:51</a>]  and you know, there's a many black performers like

[<a id="01-14-56">01:14:56</a>]  Listen to steal he said like hey man. Those are more give me careers. You're giving black people less of a war of possibility

[<a id="01-15-04">01:15:04</a>]  But you know interesting

[<a id="01-15-07">01:15:07</a>]  Black woman didn't like that war at all because whenever they say interracial it usually means black guy and a white woman

[<a id="01-15-14">01:15:14</a>]  Yeah, to me that was always bizarre because like I fucking Asian woman. It's not really interracial

[<a id="01-15-18">01:15:18</a>]  To me this was always bizarre and the interracial porn context was always very American. Yeah in Europe. No one gave a fuck

[<a id="01-15-25">01:15:25</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="01-15-27">01:15:27</a>]  But so yeah, so there was something

[<a id="01-15-29">01:15:29</a>]  This is a progress. You have less of war for black people, you know, like that's not cool, you know, like

[<a id="01-15-35">01:15:35</a>]  But I mean, okay, I think I didn't know we're gonna have this really weird conversation from Brandon to but bring it back to like it

[<a id="01-15-42">01:15:42</a>]  like like I

[<a id="01-15-44">01:15:44</a>]  Mean to me what you're telling me that's something that's something unimaginable

[<a id="01-15-48">01:15:48</a>]  Like you know someone for 20 years and then they kill themselves. Is that your best friend? I'm feeling emotion for

[<a id="01-15-55">01:15:55</a>]  Yeah, I thought I thought he was mad at me

[<a id="01-15-58">01:15:58</a>]  So I went I went to double and flew in for a day July 3rd

[<a id="01-16-02">01:16:02</a>]  2019 I was trying to find his place because I thought that was the first time he's never respond to my messages and I didn't

[<a id="01-16-08">01:16:08</a>]  Understand and I thought did I say something on the audio conversation?

[<a id="01-16-11">01:16:11</a>]  I was trying I didn't realize he killed himself three four months before that

[<a id="01-16-15">01:16:15</a>]  That's why he wasn't responding to my messages, you know, and he's always been supporting me

[<a id="01-16-19">01:16:19</a>]  Even when I got fired from evil angel that guy

[<a id="01-16-23">01:16:23</a>]  Kevin Moore who has something to do with me getting fired

[<a id="01-16-25">01:16:25</a>]  Brandon hated that guy because he's such a phony bastard, you know, Brandon was like a he definitely had like big

[<a id="01-16-32">01:16:32</a>]  Notion what's right and wrong and

[<a id="01-16-36">01:16:36</a>]  If you think he's your scumbag, he doesn't even have anything to do with you

[<a id="01-16-40">01:16:40</a>]  He's a straight shooter as you get, you know, and but

[<a id="01-16-44">01:16:44</a>]  He has sex addiction. He didn't have a lot of confidence outside of the business and he always dated women who were just mean to him

[<a id="01-16-52">01:16:52</a>]  Well, I can mean man. I didn't understand that shit

[<a id="01-16-55">01:16:55</a>]  What would you do you know much about like his story before he got into Portland like Russian Calvary when the college?

[<a id="01-17-03">01:17:03</a>]  He went to Canadian Navy. He's a well-read guy

[<a id="01-17-06">01:17:06</a>]  He works really hard

[<a id="01-17-07">01:17:07</a>]  But he had this addiction kind of thing and he started going to avian like maybe four or five years before me

[<a id="01-17-13">01:17:13</a>]  He started doing small roles, but he's got a huge dick and he could perform

[<a id="01-17-16">01:17:16</a>]  But I don't he just never had the kind of confidence that was necessary to make it big in the business

[<a id="01-17-22">01:17:22</a>]  He wanted my boss Chris Norman offer him a deal with evil angel

[<a id="01-17-27">01:17:27</a>]  And I know that doesn't mean anything to any of you, but that is a huge deal back then like for a male performer

[<a id="01-17-33">01:17:33</a>]  I guess no no getting a directorial job with evil angel is the best job ever because at the evil angel I'm like

[<a id="01-17-40">01:17:40</a>]  Working with a porn company you actually own your movies and evil angel only take commission

[<a id="01-17-46">01:17:46</a>]  So it's such a big brand. They were offering him a director. Yes

[<a id="01-17-50">01:17:50</a>]  He didn't want to take it because I'm not good enough or whatever and then and I kept telling the brand and he got mad

[<a id="01-17-56">01:17:56</a>]  At me when I brought it up because I was fighting for him

[<a id="01-17-58">01:17:58</a>]  But but that's the only time I made him mad

[<a id="01-18-00">01:18:00</a>]  I never brought it again because I can't force something on him, but yeah, he may wish to hang out. We should go like

[<a id="01-18-07">01:18:07</a>]  We used to have like a Sunday morning breakfast, so it's like me him

[<a id="01-18-15">01:18:15</a>]  Manuel Manuel Ferreira one of the biggest European movies porn star he come date my friend Dave Johnson

[<a id="01-18-21">01:18:21</a>]  Couple other guys in porn, you know, maybe Peter

[<a id="01-18-25">01:18:25</a>]  Warren with AVN editor

[<a id="01-18-28">01:18:28</a>]  So we have all these people we just show up and like we're just kind of joke around and like sometimes I ask like so

[<a id="01-18-33">01:18:33</a>]  Did you work with this girl like yeah, but she was fucking bitch

[<a id="01-18-36">01:18:36</a>]  And like, you know, we're doing a lot of gossiping about porn and stuff like that

[<a id="01-18-39">01:18:39</a>]  And what was funny like every time we sit in the corner at this diner

[<a id="01-18-42">01:18:42</a>]  Everybody wants a near and just kind of hang out with the one I hear what Manuel and Steve Holmes and the German porn star

[<a id="01-18-48">01:18:48</a>]  You know, like these are the people like, you know

[<a id="01-18-50">01:18:50</a>]  We're hanging out, you know, like yeah, where do you think the the backstabbing and bitching is worse comedy or porn?

[<a id="01-18-57">01:18:57</a>]  That's a great comedy for sure

[<a id="01-19-00">01:19:00</a>]  Little bitches every single one. Yeah, because they're worse man, but so

[<a id="01-19-10">01:19:10</a>]  You've you find out he's hung himself, yeah

[<a id="01-19-14">01:19:14</a>]  Like I mean, I know the story about your dad. It was like how well, how do you think 2019 did to me?

[<a id="01-19-23">01:19:23</a>]  branding and Brody within a couple months of just hanging and my dad and then

[<a id="01-19-29">01:19:29</a>]  You're close to Bert. You're kind of close to Brody as well. I mean all this fake people say they were friend with Brody

[<a id="01-19-36">01:19:36</a>]  I've known him for like 25 years, you know, and we talked and he'll I always made him laugh because

[<a id="01-19-41">01:19:41</a>]  Yoshi, what do you think of this one? That guy's a fucking motherfucker. Fuck that bitch, you know

[<a id="01-19-45">01:19:45</a>]  Like I because he can't get straight answer in the Hollywood

[<a id="01-19-48">01:19:48</a>]  Stand-up comedy show business, you know, because people always worry like even if even if they don't like somebody that person might be somebody

[<a id="01-19-55">01:19:55</a>]  So you always keep that shit yourself, but I was saying something like what about this?

[<a id="01-20-00">01:20:00</a>]  I hope he and his family died on Christmas, you know, that's my position about people like that

[<a id="01-20-05">01:20:05</a>]  So they know where they stand with me, you know

[<a id="01-20-07">01:20:07</a>]  That's what Brody was like that stuff. But yeah, it's um

[<a id="01-20-11">01:20:11</a>]  You know, I just think when that happened that year

[<a id="01-20-14">01:20:14</a>]  With my dad with my dad is like it's really weird because did he kill himself or did somebody murder him, you know

[<a id="01-20-21">01:20:21</a>]  And you just never know

[<a id="01-20-23">01:20:23</a>]  That's that's that's like

[<a id="01-20-26">01:20:26</a>]  like 2019 then that's a dark year for you like you're like

[<a id="01-20-30">01:20:30</a>]  It was difficult

[<a id="01-20-34">01:20:34</a>]  Weirdly

[<a id="01-20-36">01:20:36</a>]  Colbert kind of gave me a little

[<a id="01-20-38">01:20:38</a>]  Moment of

[<a id="01-20-42">01:20:42</a>]  Clarity and time I got a little healthier. It's weird Colbert was actually kind of time when I got healthier because

[<a id="01-20-49">01:20:49</a>]  My friend Stan Chan and he's like Karen. I was ready to go to Phoenix to New York

[<a id="01-20-54">01:20:54</a>]  Hey, you know, it's kind of dangerous was it was why don't you just stay here and that I've standard for four months

[<a id="01-20-58">01:20:58</a>]  that was four months where I have really nice bed in the back house where I don't even bother them and I

[<a id="01-21-04">01:21:04</a>]  was able to live, you know, so I got healthier and

[<a id="01-21-07">01:21:07</a>]  That was great, but

[<a id="01-21-11">01:21:11</a>]  In terms of my friends, you know

[<a id="01-21-15">01:21:15</a>]  like anytime

[<a id="01-21-18">01:21:18</a>]  especially like somebody I know but

[<a id="01-21-20">01:21:20</a>]  I'm I am a little sensitive like Jake my friend Jason Riles like whenever comedian pass away

[<a id="01-21-25">01:21:25</a>]  It does even if I don't know them like I just feel like their colleague

[<a id="01-21-30">01:21:30</a>]  You know and in porn is another one like I know people think I'm joking

[<a id="01-21-34">01:21:34</a>]  But like soon as I heard George Floyd was a dead porn like he I have a more priority

[<a id="01-21-39">01:21:39</a>]  Having empathy for him over other one. I know he did some bad things

[<a id="01-21-42">01:21:42</a>]  I didn't realize until later on like he hit women and shit like that. I don't like that but

[<a id="01-21-46">01:21:46</a>]  You know, I think I just I still don't understand like

[<a id="01-21-50">01:21:50</a>]  Dude, you have handcuffs around. He's not a threat. So why are you standing on top of him?

[<a id="01-21-55">01:21:55</a>]  Like you kind of like a like a bear or something, you know, he's trying to think I mean

[<a id="01-22-00">01:22:00</a>]  It's a reflect on the comedy scene here

[<a id="01-22-03">01:22:03</a>]  We haven't been around that long like the comedy in Switzerland is like eight years old and nobody says that's just insane

[<a id="01-22-09">01:22:09</a>]  And nobody we know none of the because it's like it's between it's like 75 comedians now

[<a id="01-22-17">01:22:17</a>]  Like there's probably about 70. I don't know the face. I've seen some did you say about seven to eight years?

[<a id="01-22-24">01:22:24</a>]  It's been around seven to eight years. Yeah, the English comedy scene. Okay

[<a id="01-22-28">01:22:28</a>]  It's really five years because that two years in Colbert really shouldn't count true. Yeah. Yeah, actually what's five years?

[<a id="01-22-34">01:22:34</a>]  It's fucking nothing. It's high school, bitch. So nobody nobody's yet died on this scene. I've also I thought about oh god

[<a id="01-22-41">01:22:41</a>]  I've seen because I'm probably the first that's gonna die

[<a id="01-22-45">01:22:45</a>]  I have I have a weird feeling that you won't be no you won't really no

[<a id="01-22-49">01:22:49</a>]  No, I'll bet you a bitch because it's gonna be someone really young overdose. It's gonna be overdosed

[<a id="01-22-55">01:22:55</a>]  Or they're doing it for all the wrong reason things doesn't go out and they take it really really hard

[<a id="01-23-00">01:23:00</a>]  That has happened already a couple times in Austin, Texas, you know

[<a id="01-23-03">01:23:03</a>]  When you're when you're young you just get even small things seem big, you know

[<a id="01-23-08">01:23:08</a>]  Have you have you have you had somebody talking shit about you in podcast or Twitter and you think everybody knows believe me?

[<a id="01-23-15">01:23:15</a>]  999 percent of word don't know that whatever you think you're upset. Oh, I've had I've had I've been the most hated male in this

[<a id="01-23-22">01:23:22</a>]  city about it has nothing to do with comedy and

[<a id="01-23-25">01:23:25</a>]  No, it actually did because I put a video making fun of it, you know

[<a id="01-23-31">01:23:31</a>]  Put this in context. All right, so how many?

[<a id="01-23-36">01:23:36</a>]  No, the 3,000 women in that group. So you told me I told you about this this like I'll be dating the same guy

[<a id="01-23-46">01:23:46</a>]  It's a it's the most ridiculous female thing that I've ever heard

[<a id="01-23-49">01:23:49</a>]  but we spoke about this on the previous episode, but it was in a

[<a id="01-23-53">01:23:53</a>]  To me the interesting episode of that in terms of this like yeah, am I going to commit self-harm? I'm gonna have a crisis

[<a id="01-24-00">01:24:00</a>]  There's a beautiful thing. I think it's sort of like a message of hope. Yeah people

[<a id="01-24-06">01:24:06</a>]  Past 50 the level to which I don't give a fuck

[<a id="01-24-12">01:24:12</a>]  Because I I know like death is not that far away. I mean, okay

[<a id="01-24-17">01:24:17</a>]  I'm more than here here. I agree with you and and I don't need to hurry it up with like actually

[<a id="01-24-24">01:24:24</a>]  Directly killing myself. I'm probably gonna die

[<a id="01-24-27">01:24:27</a>]  Like drowning in bomb vomit or whatever. My lungs kill me, but yeah, whatever it is

[<a id="01-24-35">01:24:35</a>]  It's just it's just I'm enjoying this bit while it's still there

[<a id="01-24-40">01:24:40</a>]  You haven't enjoyed life as much as and and having three thousand angry bitches

[<a id="01-24-46">01:24:46</a>]  Yeah, just made me smile in a certain way because it's like none of that means anything

[<a id="01-24-52">01:24:52</a>]  It's like it's all here and now and and once you've got past halfway through your life

[<a id="01-24-57">01:24:57</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="01-24-58">01:24:58</a>]  You realize how retarded all that shit is and I know Harry he's not worried about dangerous like his his response

[<a id="01-25-04">01:25:04</a>]  Oh my god, three thousand people know me

[<a id="01-25-08">01:25:08</a>]  Yeah, yeah, but but yeah, I like

[<a id="01-25-11">01:25:11</a>]  But the thing is yeah, you get what I'm saying, it's like it's like

[<a id="01-25-16">01:25:16</a>]  what I think is I mean to me what really surprised me is ever here someone who's like

[<a id="01-25-23">01:25:23</a>]  Okay, I can't understand if you if you're if you're a really painful disease

[<a id="01-25-29">01:25:29</a>]  Yeah, and suicide you're 60 plus people that commit suicide in later life that that is like what the fuck

[<a id="01-25-37">01:25:37</a>]  You made it this far

[<a id="01-25-39">01:25:39</a>]  Can you just climb on a little bit longer? No, I think there's a sense of control of going out on your own terms

[<a id="01-25-45">01:25:45</a>]  Yeah, but not even that I mean, I can't get it. Do you want to become a vegetable?

[<a id="01-25-50">01:25:50</a>]  I'm

[<a id="01-25-53">01:25:53</a>]  Like I'll put me up on stage when I'm halfway gone

[<a id="01-25-56">01:25:56</a>]  I'm still gonna like try probably still the same jokes as well. I like Stephen Hawkins like cracking stand-up comedy

[<a id="01-26-03">01:26:03</a>]  I couldn't understand what Christian saying because what's the point if you lose your money like you're just existing, but you don't even remember anything

[<a id="01-26-09">01:26:09</a>]  You know, but I have a pact with my family as soon as any one of us has

[<a id="01-26-14">01:26:14</a>]  A vegetable state. Yeah, mom is gonna pull the plug. That's I

[<a id="01-26-20">01:26:20</a>]  Disagree with this because you're vegetarian

[<a id="01-26-22">01:26:22</a>]  Ha ha ha because if I don't have like cuz I got a smart brain if I don't have my smart brain

[<a id="01-26-29">01:26:29</a>]  Like going I look at you do all this shit and then I can be a like half stupid person

[<a id="01-26-35">01:26:35</a>]  I might actually enjoy life more moment by moment. Oh, I see what you're saying

[<a id="01-26-39">01:26:39</a>]  It's like why do you have to end it just because you're comparing it to how it used to be

[<a id="01-26-45">01:26:45</a>]  Okay, but we are gonna ending it now

[<a id="01-26-47">01:26:47</a>]  This is a good point. I'll give you I'll give you that I see both of your points. Yeah

[<a id="01-26-53">01:26:53</a>]  Wow a podcast where males agreed

[<a id="01-27-00">01:27:00</a>]  I

[<a id="01-27-02">01:27:02</a>]  Just I was not that was pretty funny, but that shit with Pelican Bay that made me laugh like oh, I didn't know you went there
