[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  you talk finish talking about I have question for you and now I feel like I'm

[<a id="00-00-09">00:00:09</a>]  being hostage well you got to tell them why you're talking about because we were

[<a id="00-00-40">00:00:40</a>]  some kind of success yeah that's like a 90% of comedians

[<a id="00-00-53">00:00:53</a>]  here's my physics and this also comes from study is this idea of biorhythms

[<a id="00-01-03">00:01:03</a>]  was popular in the 80s is that if you look over a period of two weeks that

[<a id="00-01-09">00:01:09</a>]  your emotional state and other states are going up and down like a sine wave

[<a id="00-01-13">00:01:13</a>]  and that's right now most people I think they've been through the x-axis is way

[<a id="00-01-36">00:01:36</a>]  lower but don't you think sometimes people without a trauma they were born

[<a id="00-01-51">00:01:51</a>]  like that you there's just naturally melancholy like Jewish or Irish or

[<a id="00-02-08">00:02:08</a>]  Armenian or groups of people who's been yeah yeah

[<a id="00-02-17">00:02:17</a>]  most people yeah over the course of a month they'll still pay their bills sure

[<a id="00-02-29">00:02:29</a>]  if you if your level is lower because you're coping with like a real drama

[<a id="00-02-35">00:02:35</a>]  that the torment you at night maybe it wakes you up at 3 a.m. and you're sweating

[<a id="00-02-41">00:02:41</a>]  that means okay I know what you mean because some people are functional and

[<a id="00-03-06">00:03:06</a>]  they're at their best on stage or if their athlete in the field of competition

[<a id="00-03-12">00:03:12</a>]  but outside of it they're not functional at all okay yeah

[<a id="00-03-42">00:03:42</a>]  oh wow to be fair your weather has changed quite a bit last 24 hours to

[<a id="00-04-06">00:04:06</a>]  right it should have been to complete sold out because his talent demands it

[<a id="00-04-23">00:04:23</a>]  he's a funny guy and it was a wonderful show yeah my god so he's worse than me

[<a id="00-04-42">00:04:42</a>]  because I don't want to do that shit either yeah I don't want to send that

[<a id="00-04-54">00:04:54</a>]  stuff but you asked me to three times a fucking so I will send you something yeah

[<a id="00-05-05">00:05:05</a>]  yeah yeah I don't want to mention my friend well it's a friend I haven't seen

[<a id="00-05-24">00:05:24</a>]  what he's performing tomorrow and they're having a hard time selling tickets but

[<a id="00-05-39">00:05:39</a>]  yeah when he comes to Switzerland he puts a theme of a show like he's got the

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  show that's my marketing problem because my show is called rape and this is not

[<a id="00-06-17">00:06:17</a>]  it's a very tough so isn't it problem is Japanese pronouncing like lepu so it

[<a id="00-06-29">00:06:29</a>]  doesn't sound like it doesn't down we say lepu it doesn't sound exactly what

[<a id="00-06-36">00:06:36</a>]  it sounds like yeah well I mean we can't R&L is very difficult for us so the the

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  word with anything with R we it sounds like a L in Japanese so we don't say

[<a id="00-06-49">00:06:49</a>]  rape who say lepu it's hilarious but what's what's funny is the who get mad

[<a id="00-07-06">00:07:06</a>]  it's usually like white liberals and Japanese Americans who don't know

[<a id="00-07-11">00:07:11</a>]  anything about their heritage in the language but real Japanese they don't

[<a id="00-07-14">00:07:14</a>]  give a fuck at all they don't care

[<a id="00-07-18">00:07:18</a>]  that's funny I mean even if even if you think that's racist like first thing you

[<a id="00-07-41">00:07:41</a>]  have to remember it's funny yeah so you talk about your dad you talk about your

[<a id="00-07-54">00:07:54</a>]  mom and you grow with your mom and did you have a fairly happy childhood and

[<a id="00-08-00">00:08:00</a>]  then what was your like high school and college experience college if any

[<a id="00-08-07">00:08:07</a>]  so yeah so I was high school or college so your mom is English but she learned to

[<a id="00-08-30">00:08:30</a>]  speak German I see yeah okay

[<a id="00-08-55">00:08:55</a>]  yes

[<a id="00-08-58">00:08:58</a>]  this sounds like a Suzuki method it's a type of musical training where you let

[<a id="00-09-17">00:09:17</a>]  kids play certain musical instrumental in point to the point where they're

[<a id="00-09-21">00:09:21</a>]  having fun but before they get too much fun they take away the instrument and

[<a id="00-09-25">00:09:25</a>]  they're kind of deprived when they want it back and that's how they get them

[<a id="00-09-29">00:09:29</a>]  hooked on like a piano lesson and things like that yeah when it comes to

[<a id="00-09-33">00:09:33</a>]  education in Asia it's not about enriching and make you a better person

[<a id="00-09-37">00:09:37</a>]  it's trying to make you do well in school that you're getting great college

[<a id="00-09-43">00:09:43</a>]  and university so the parents could brag about it but they don't really care

[<a id="00-09-46">00:09:46</a>]  about actual learning or being rude like traditional European gentlemen of 19th

[<a id="00-09-52">00:09:52</a>]  century you know you have there was a guy named Peter Drucker right he was a

[<a id="00-09-56">00:09:56</a>]  big management guru and for last century and I'm sure now business school they

[<a id="00-10-03">00:10:03</a>]  read Peter Drucker's principle of management well what's interesting I

[<a id="00-10-06">00:10:06</a>]  think Peter Drucker's from Austria Vienna Vienna Austria and not only was

[<a id="00-10-12">00:10:12</a>]  he well educated successful businessman but he is a man of 19th century he was

[<a id="00-10-16">00:10:16</a>]  well educated in so many different discipline you know oh what happened it

[<a id="00-10-21">00:10:21</a>]  wasn't recording yes so I don't think most Asian parents care about that sort

[<a id="00-10-41">00:10:41</a>]  of being rude public speaker and being a gentleman of a high culture and things

[<a id="00-10-47">00:10:47</a>]  like that it's it's like present somebody like you did a good job raising

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  a kid your kid is a sophisticated person but do they actually care about certain

[<a id="00-10-56">00:10:56</a>]  tragedy in ancient Greece or Shakespeare and things like that I don't

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  think so I've never had a conversation with Asian parents about that they like

[<a id="00-11-03">00:11:03</a>]  their kids being seen as well educated especially like medical school and

[<a id="00-11-08">00:11:08</a>]  things like that you know engineering law school and things like that I mean you

[<a id="00-11-12">00:11:12</a>]  know I give this example all the time Asian parents if given a choice of if

[<a id="00-11-18">00:11:18</a>]  they have a daughter possible scooters person one is is a guy who owns a

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  garbage company makes five million dollars a year collecting garbage versus

[<a id="00-11-30">00:11:30</a>]  candidate number two make a half a million dollars a year but it's a doctor

[<a id="00-11-34">00:11:34</a>]  I would imagine most Asian parents would pick the doctor even though he's making

[<a id="00-11-40">00:11:40</a>]  you know the garbage guys making ten times more than that it's a combination

[<a id="00-11-45">00:11:45</a>]  of things right like and I think it's probably true for these Instagram only

[<a id="00-11-49">00:11:49</a>]  fan girls giving the opportunity like a guy worth a billion dollars or the guy

[<a id="00-11-55">00:11:55</a>]  worth 10 billion but he's famous online in the world the girls probably pick

[<a id="00-12-00">00:12:00</a>]  somebody with money but fame is like a bigger thing I think first of all you

[<a id="00-12-21">00:12:21</a>]  should first of all my advice to you is if you're gonna say misogynistic thing

[<a id="00-12-26">00:12:26</a>]  just say it but don't tell them it is don't say just say it because it might

[<a id="00-12-31">00:12:31</a>]  not be and and and and then you might end up

[<a id="00-12-54">00:12:54</a>]  I mean you could go to like a talent village and there's a group of women go

[<a id="00-12-57">00:12:57</a>]  down the river every day and doing the laundry as a group too so you know I

[<a id="00-13-07">00:13:07</a>]  mean assuming that she's attractive looking yeah cuz growing up when I I'm

[<a id="00-13-29">00:13:29</a>]  sure you're old enough to remember Playboy magazines have a center for in

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  the which is the center of it to me I never really thought Playboy magazine as

[<a id="00-13-36">00:13:36</a>]  pornography my opinion it was like a resume because you put yourself in the

[<a id="00-13-42">00:13:42</a>]  magazine for suitable successful men see you and a guy the men of that level

[<a id="00-13-52">00:13:52</a>]  having their girl naked in that format is a prestigious thing you don't you

[<a id="00-14-00">00:14:00</a>]  don't want your future wife to have a naked picture in like some duty as gas

[<a id="00-14-05">00:14:05</a>]  station bathroom that's a different things you know so yeah to me that was

[<a id="00-14-11">00:14:11</a>]  like CV you know it's like a resume you know and the presenting yourself to

[<a id="00-14-15">00:14:15</a>]  successful men I don't think it that was any more different than this if you

[<a id="00-14-20">00:14:20</a>]  become a flight attendant and you're good looking you work in the first class

[<a id="00-14-24">00:14:24</a>]  because you won't meet suitable men who could afford to buy those expensive

[<a id="00-14-28">00:14:28</a>]  tickets and and that's okay it's all ladies it's okay to look great it's it's

[<a id="00-14-34">00:14:34</a>]  okay to work out make yourself presentable it's okay to want to be with

[<a id="00-14-39">00:14:39</a>]  somebody successful good for you I think that's great

[<a id="00-15-00">00:15:00</a>]  yeah yeah but can I ask you that why is that a bullshit though sure

[<a id="00-15-30">00:15:30</a>]  yeah because whether you say or not somebody's high value low value you know

[<a id="00-15-40">00:15:40</a>]  where your partner stand and she knows where you stand in the universe too you

[<a id="00-15-44">00:15:44</a>]  know because there's only truth in podcast yes

[<a id="00-16-11">00:16:11</a>]  very successful I didn't know who he was until recently he's got a lot of

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  interesting people in this podcast good-looking guy very very charming oh

[<a id="00-16-40">00:16:40</a>]  sure yeah but we do all kinds of terrible things in the world so that we

[<a id="00-17-04">00:17:04</a>]  could get women to yeah but don't you think that's impossible

[<a id="00-17-15">00:17:15</a>]  I think it is possible that we need a radical cultural change because it's all

[<a id="00-17-22">00:17:22</a>]  it's all just the bullshit that we get told when we're young and so you know

[<a id="00-17-30">00:17:30</a>]  you instinctively as a human you know you have a sense for what's the right

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  path but then between the ages of 12 and 30 yeah

[<a id="00-17-48">00:17:48</a>]  wait but that doesn't seem like a reality these young people are less

[<a id="00-18-08">00:18:08</a>]  sexual than the generation the generation to you know I was talking to

[<a id="00-18-22">00:18:22</a>]  my friend in Amsterdam and she's from Greece and she was telling me it's so

[<a id="00-18-29">00:18:29</a>]  weird Netherlands because women always have to make the first move and the guys

[<a id="00-18-33">00:18:33</a>]  are always hesitant like it's okay if I hold your hand and she was like Jesus

[<a id="00-18-37">00:18:37</a>]  Christ just hold my hand you know so that's that's interesting how women in

[<a id="00-18-42">00:18:42</a>]  that situation women are seen more masculine whereas guys I see more

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  feminine you know or cooperative and things like that I don't know what's

[<a id="00-18-51">00:18:51</a>]  going on to make it just so strange strange I mean don't go harass women

[<a id="00-18-57">00:18:57</a>]  either that's like the other extreme but it is strange I don't know what's going

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  on cuz that's what I keep hearing from people like they're very hesitant you

[<a id="00-19-05">00:19:05</a>]  know yeah yeah bill burr talk about that yeah

[<a id="00-19-35">00:19:35</a>]  yeah and I think because I work in sex business I it's not that I get a

[<a id="00-19-50">00:19:50</a>]  balanced view but a couple of my female friends were kind of stunned by this

[<a id="00-19-54">00:19:54</a>]  when I work with when I meet or when I have to work with transgender person the

[<a id="00-20-01">00:20:01</a>]  the rare ones is when a woman transition into a man you know because it's more

[<a id="00-20-07">00:20:07</a>]  often it's usually men turn into a woman whatever it's not my business but what

[<a id="00-20-13">00:20:13</a>]  was interesting with when I talked to a woman transition into a man because they

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  take male hormones and they're just shocked that they can't believe I'm on

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  urges that they get to have a sex now they have little bit more understanding

[<a id="00-20-27">00:20:27</a>]  of sympathy for men because it's not the men don't rape they obviously do that

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  secret assault they do terrible things but what she realized now he is that the

[<a id="00-20-36">00:20:36</a>]  vast majority of men choose not to do that even though after taking these

[<a id="00-20-41">00:20:41</a>]  hormones like the urge is so strong that women don't understand that it's it's

[<a id="00-20-47">00:20:47</a>]  actually many men are pretty decent about it and women don't understand that

[<a id="00-20-53">00:20:53</a>]  that the teasing that they do and the way they dress provocative that the men

[<a id="00-20-59">00:20:59</a>]  men are actually pretty decent about that you know and how difficult it is

[<a id="00-21-16">00:21:16</a>]  Sanchez and then it got me immediately thinking of that movie heats with

[<a id="00-21-22">00:21:22</a>]  Robert De Niro yeah there's a bit where De Niro's going like if the heat is

[<a id="00-21-29">00:21:29</a>]  around the corner you drop everything 30 seconds sure and it's it's there's this

[<a id="00-21-37">00:21:37</a>]  shift of mindset yeah and it's also that's a bad idea at the end of the day

[<a id="00-21-57">00:21:57</a>]  and in a practical you go to your buddies yeah one of your friends makes a

[<a id="00-22-14">00:22:14</a>]  joke about your girlfriend and then and you're like oh you fucking asshole and

[<a id="00-22-19">00:22:19</a>]  then you laugh because it was a funny joke and then and that's how we process

[<a id="00-22-24">00:22:24</a>]  trauma yeah I mean I mean maybe this is very immature on my part but I just

[<a id="00-22-30">00:22:30</a>]  don't think at the end of the day it's it's a practical thing to express your

[<a id="00-22-34">00:22:34</a>]  feelings because I think women don't care I think in general but if you look

[<a id="00-22-39">00:22:39</a>]  like Timothy Chalamet of course you could express your feeling and they will

[<a id="00-22-42">00:22:42</a>]  love that yeah they will they will always make exception to the rule if they

[<a id="00-22-46">00:22:46</a>]  said they don't like X Y & Z but they meet X Y & Z of exceptional level they

[<a id="00-22-53">00:22:53</a>]  will even make exception to that rule tool you know so I just I just think

[<a id="00-23-23">00:23:23</a>]  basically what you're saying I think it's like it's not practical to show

[<a id="00-23-28">00:23:28</a>]  your weakness to them yeah and even even if the guy's weak that he could make a

[<a id="00-23-52">00:23:52</a>]  provide for thing for you so make some women would tolerate that too yeah you

[<a id="00-23-58">00:23:58</a>]  know just like this I don't know did you see the new Sean Baker's movie Anora the

[<a id="00-24-02">00:24:02</a>]  main character in the movie is this Russian oligarch just spoil your son and

[<a id="00-24-07">00:24:07</a>]  in the beginning the character main character I know I think he is a prince

[<a id="00-24-12">00:24:12</a>]  the later one she find out that he's he might not be a prince after all you know

[<a id="00-24-18">00:24:18</a>]  but you know I I don't have a issue when people call them high value low value

[<a id="00-24-25">00:24:25</a>]  relationship what not you know I think I get it you you have to do what's best

[<a id="00-24-30">00:24:30</a>]  for you you know I'm more concerned if I have to I don't know anything about your

[<a id="00-24-45">00:24:45</a>]  kids but I'll be more concerned but your son because I think your daughter could

[<a id="00-24-48">00:24:48</a>]  handle herself

[<a id="00-24-51">00:24:51</a>]  but here's the thing I was interested in me is when if you if you talk to it's

[<a id="00-24-58">00:24:58</a>]  kind of fading away now yeah but the whole gender roles I know of Eastern

[<a id="00-25-06">00:25:06</a>]  East Germans who like raised in the communist system yeah and women work the

[<a id="00-25-12">00:25:12</a>]  same as men there was no question at all about like the whole gender rules so we

[<a id="00-25-18">00:25:18</a>]  have in America and in the West didn't even exist yeah and you when you come

[<a id="00-25-42">00:25:42</a>]  home you contribute to same amount of housing labor between the you know yeah

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  fundamentally what's interesting about that is if you meet some of the women

[<a id="00-25-55">00:25:55</a>]  that grew up in that time they like Angela Merkel I think she I think she

[<a id="00-26-03">00:26:03</a>]  was she grew up in East Germany yes and engineering major yeah yeah no bullshit

[<a id="00-26-14">00:26:14</a>]  she didn't I don't think she necessarily show a lot of her emotion and been

[<a id="00-26-17">00:26:17</a>]  sentimental she was very effective leader you know yeah no she was I saw

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  her October 31st 2017 I forgot the name of the town but it was a 500 year

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  anniversary of reformations I went there in that particular day and she was there

[<a id="00-26-39">00:26:39</a>]  among other European leaders there you know and there's this toughness and

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  firmness to her without being obnoxious you know yeah she just saved matter

[<a id="00-26-49">00:26:49</a>]  factory and I really like about that you know you go back to time of out of bond

[<a id="00-26-56">00:26:56</a>]  fist mark my kind of leader you know he practical leader yeah

[<a id="00-27-13">00:27:13</a>]  this reminds me why porn has changed my opinion about women to that

[<a id="00-27-43">00:27:43</a>]  whenever I see a guy watching porn for the first time apart relatively new to

[<a id="00-27-48">00:27:48</a>]  pornographic moral they always pick girls but the best-looking face and

[<a id="00-27-52">00:27:52</a>]  stuff like that but what I noticed when I got older watching like pornography I

[<a id="00-27-56">00:27:56</a>]  don't really care what the woman looked like I'm more concerned with what she is

[<a id="00-27-59">00:27:59</a>]  capable of doing with her body so she could be so cool traditionally not

[<a id="00-28-05">00:28:05</a>]  considered be traditionally beautiful I don't really care because pretty girls

[<a id="00-28-09">00:28:09</a>]  are boring bed - and I think I became I'm always like judging somebody by what

[<a id="00-28-15">00:28:15</a>]  what they are capable of doing you know and that superficial stuff I get kind of

[<a id="00-28-21">00:28:21</a>]  old you know what do you what do you mean so we're like

[<a id="00-28-51">00:28:51</a>]  early 90s yeah yeah he said one of those like a bondage fetish thing

[<a id="00-29-07">00:29:07</a>]  and it was extreme and she tried to drop it and it got stuck and then she's

[<a id="00-29-20">00:29:20</a>]  panicking yeah yeah but there's also a level of incredible ruthlessness to

[<a id="00-29-35">00:29:35</a>]  yourself I don't think you're making stuff up I'm not clear on the question

[<a id="00-29-56">00:29:56</a>]  okay but for some people that's a they get off on be humiliating themselves yeah

[<a id="00-30-11">00:30:11</a>]  you know there's a tape where bunch of Japanese girls are with their high heels

[<a id="00-30-16">00:30:16</a>]  stumping this Japanese guy's testicle with it it's not something I would do

[<a id="00-30-20">00:30:20</a>]  yeah but he gets off on it and girls like it you know

[<a id="00-30-25">00:30:25</a>]  I was to edit a too busy editing it so I had to I'm kidding

[<a id="00-30-45">00:30:45</a>]  yeah it's like that English girl that you're talking about she fucked bunch of

[<a id="00-31-00">00:31:00</a>]  guys or whatever and I have to say she's very attractive to me and I also watch

[<a id="00-31-09">00:31:09</a>]  wrestling so I understand she's trolling like upsetting people but she get her

[<a id="00-31-13">00:31:13</a>]  name out there now she's gonna make tons of money you know yeah I never thought

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  that when I travel across six thousand miles that one of the thing we'll be

[<a id="00-31-26">00:31:26</a>]  talking about that but go ahead you need to pause for a second because there are

[<a id="00-31-36">00:31:36</a>]  people listening to this have no idea what you're talking about okay you don't

[<a id="00-31-59">00:31:59</a>]  you don't think they were into it yeah

[<a id="00-32-09">00:32:09</a>]  I mean but the part of part of the things you're you're you're applying your

[<a id="00-32-34">00:32:34</a>]  standard and like I would never do that but I miss so many strange people who

[<a id="00-32-38">00:32:38</a>]  are into that kind of stuff so so to me to you that might be humiliating but to

[<a id="00-32-45">00:32:45</a>]  them seeing you open mic is a humiliating thing too if they consented

[<a id="00-32-54">00:32:54</a>]  to something that looks weird but that's what they're into I don't really

[<a id="00-32-57">00:32:57</a>]  question it because I don't I don't know what led them to liking that I wouldn't

[<a id="00-33-02">00:33:02</a>]  do it but if that's what they're into then maybe it's not a humiliating thing

[<a id="00-33-05">00:33:05</a>]  because we're putting our value onto them you know eating shit is not my

[<a id="00-33-09">00:33:09</a>]  number one priority but but if that's what you're into I don't really question

[<a id="00-33-16">00:33:16</a>]  because you know I think one other thing working at the porn company that I did

[<a id="00-33-21">00:33:21</a>]  there's a lot of times I'm sitting in the room like I'm watching like what the

[<a id="00-33-25">00:33:25</a>]  fuck is this then I'll call my colleagues and we sit down figure out

[<a id="00-33-28">00:33:28</a>]  ways this legal if it's legal like why do they do it it become like a symposium

[<a id="00-33-33">00:33:33</a>]  where I have conversation with other perverts in the room you know having

[<a id="00-33-36">00:33:36</a>]  this conversation like you know so that was that was revealing and even after

[<a id="00-33-42">00:33:42</a>]  hours when I was hanging out with my friends like you know like I see Steve

[<a id="00-33-46">00:33:46</a>]  Holmes a German guy like hey did you what did you work did you work with this

[<a id="00-33-49">00:33:49</a>]  person he was like yeah but we did this thing and it was fucking weird and what

[<a id="00-33-53">00:33:53</a>]  was if Steve say was weird and it's got to be weird you know so we have this

[<a id="00-33-57">00:33:57</a>]  constant conversation and then if you're a mixed martial artist and you're living

[<a id="00-34-06">00:34:06</a>]  it's like punching the shit out of someone and anybody found a mixed

[<a id="00-34-09">00:34:09</a>]  martial art they love that see somebody get knocked out but if you're not into

[<a id="00-34-14">00:34:14</a>]  that and and you just see group of people like cheering to see somebody get

[<a id="00-34-18">00:34:18</a>]  knocked out it's weird to them within that group of people who like mixed

[<a id="00-34-22">00:34:22</a>]  martial art it's great because even when I heard like women are fighting you let

[<a id="00-34-26">00:34:26</a>]  them women just beat the shit out of each other and and and I thought like that's

[<a id="00-34-30">00:34:30</a>]  wrong but when I watched it I you know what was weird I thought it was wrong

[<a id="00-34-34">00:34:34</a>]  not only did I liked it I thought it was more amazing compared when men are

[<a id="00-34-40">00:34:40</a>]  fighting because you know what's amazing when I'm when two women fight it it it

[<a id="00-34-45">00:34:45</a>]  just so interesting to me like a lady winning a match and she's crying right

[<a id="00-34-53">00:34:53</a>]  she knocked the other bitch out but she's crying because she's so happy that

[<a id="00-34-57">00:34:57</a>]  she won but women are more honest about their feelings so like even though she's

[<a id="00-35-01">00:35:01</a>]  masculine she could kick the shit out of me I I find that really interesting that

[<a id="00-35-07">00:35:07</a>]  they're able to do that because I think it's hard for men to be completely true

[<a id="00-35-11">00:35:11</a>]  to their feelings and if they are going to be true to their feelings what they

[<a id="00-35-15">00:35:15</a>]  usually like to do is just stay home by themselves and drink themselves you know

[<a id="00-35-19">00:35:19</a>]  I mean if I have those feelings I'd rather not show that just go home drink

[<a id="00-35-24">00:35:24</a>]  drink a beer or something and knock myself out you know but to me that the

[<a id="00-35-29">00:35:29</a>]  fighting wasn't the most amazing part with the women their honest reaction at

[<a id="00-35-32">00:35:32</a>]  the end of the match like I was really amazed by that oh yeah I don't think I

[<a id="00-35-45">00:35:45</a>]  would come watching it this just so it just it just only few percentage you

[<a id="00-35-52">00:35:52</a>]  know maybe one or two or three percent out of a hundred men crying looks

[<a id="00-35-57">00:35:57</a>]  dignified you know and it's a depends on circumstance too because if your mom

[<a id="00-36-01">00:36:01</a>]  died or your pro athlete whole fam career you're retiring that's one of the

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  few times I think it's okay for the guy to cry or winning a championship it's

[<a id="00-36-10">00:36:10</a>]  understandable but anything outside of that I just think you're not gonna get a

[<a id="00-36-15">00:36:15</a>]  universal approval for men crying I don't think we were providers and we

[<a id="00-36-21">00:36:21</a>]  were protecting people we don't have time to have reflecting our emotion you

[<a id="00-36-26">00:36:26</a>]  know we were supposed to be functional any given moment you know before you

[<a id="00-36-38">00:36:38</a>]  continue I just saw the new gladiator and to Paul Mascale I don't know if that's

[<a id="00-36-45">00:36:45</a>]  how you said anyway there's a conflict between him with the Denzel Washington

[<a id="00-36-55">00:36:55</a>]  character okay yeah and I was just all time I just like I just fucking saw this

[<a id="00-37-01">00:37:01</a>]  with Mike Tyson and you know fucking the pole kid kicking that shit out of Mike

[<a id="00-37-07">00:37:07</a>]  Tyson you know I don't wanna I don't want to keep seeing I like Denzel but

[<a id="00-37-11">00:37:11</a>]  he's 70 I think pushing 70 years old I don't I'm tired of these old guys doing

[<a id="00-37-16">00:37:16</a>]  actions you know like

[<a id="00-37-30">00:37:30</a>]  yeah you think so you thought he could have be him

[<a id="00-37-53">00:37:53</a>]  yeah yeah we'll talk about incredible

[<a id="00-38-23">00:38:23</a>]  character and one of the most entertaining performer I saw him do a

[<a id="00-38-28">00:38:28</a>]  live Vegas one-man show phenomenal and you know there's many many other great

[<a id="00-38-35">00:38:35</a>]  boxes obviously but I don't really know history of boxing well I just remember

[<a id="00-38-39">00:38:39</a>]  like Mike Tyson was my favorite boxer when I was a kid I never paying

[<a id="00-38-43">00:38:43</a>]  attention really I mean there was a match between Antonio Inoki Japanese

[<a id="00-38-48">00:38:48</a>]  wrestler and Ali in the mid 70s but outside of that Mike Tyson always been

[<a id="00-38-53">00:38:53</a>]  like the guy you just love you know just knocking motherfuckers out and he did a

[<a id="00-39-04">00:39:04</a>]  one-man show about his life and I saw him in Vegas is phenomenal I really

[<a id="00-39-08">00:39:08</a>]  enjoyed that a lot and and he's a survivor you know cuz every boxer is not

[<a id="00-39-13">00:39:13</a>]  gonna win every single match but they come from such a humbling terrible

[<a id="00-39-17">00:39:17</a>]  poor situation you know boxing is not a sports for upper class people you know

[<a id="00-39-22">00:39:22</a>]  it's usually desperate people fighting for their lives and for their family and

[<a id="00-39-27">00:39:27</a>]  talk about Mike Tyson he's been part of my life since 80s 90s 2000 2010 2020 you

[<a id="00-39-35">00:39:35</a>]  know incredible you know and we're very lucky to have him entertaining and and

[<a id="00-39-41">00:39:41</a>]  and somebody who works in sex business and reading deposition and what happened

[<a id="00-39-45">00:39:45</a>]  in Indianapolis I think he was innocent of the rape too you know and but he's a

[<a id="00-39-50">00:39:50</a>]  survivor you know we're very lucky to have him I think he's amazing guy I met

[<a id="00-39-54">00:39:54</a>]  him once and I like him

[<a id="00-40-02">00:40:02</a>]  yeah I'm just mad put a $30 on him and then you know I lost the fucking bed so

[<a id="00-40-27">00:40:27</a>]  yeah they're incredible they're incredible artists in my opinion they're

[<a id="00-40-48">00:40:48</a>]  good at self-promotion and he understand they both understand young

[<a id="00-40-52">00:40:52</a>]  people and in a culture and like amazing you know they're incredible success

[<a id="00-40-56">00:40:56</a>]  story so good for them yeah he went to the suicide forest I wasn't mad because

[<a id="00-41-12">00:41:12</a>]  you know thank you for finding my father and for those of you don't know my dad

[<a id="00-41-19">00:41:19</a>]  killed himself supposedly or he was murdered I have no idea but yeah when I

[<a id="00-41-26">00:41:26</a>]  do when I say stuff like that people think it's I didn't love my my dad or

[<a id="00-41-32">00:41:32</a>]  something like that it's a coping mechanism you know and I think sometime

[<a id="00-41-35">00:41:35</a>]  when I do my shows it's pretty dark but it's not for everyone obviously you know

[<a id="00-41-40">00:41:40</a>]  but the ones that like it like it they really fucking like it you know yeah

[<a id="00-42-10">00:42:10</a>]  and plus you know my backstory that's why yeah but you're saying the most

[<a id="00-42-29">00:42:29</a>]  stuff doesn't shock you what were you saying like there's something I say

[<a id="00-42-32">00:42:32</a>]  shock you yeah I don't know I'll be shocked depends on the color of the skin

[<a id="00-42-54">00:42:54</a>]  of the victim yeah my dad was so dark when they found his body because I went

[<a id="00-43-09">00:43:09</a>]  to police station saw that picture well I talked about it before it's about that

[<a id="00-43-25">00:43:25</a>]  he was there long enough that he could turn completely black he looked like

[<a id="00-43-28">00:43:28</a>]  Nightcrawler from the Marvel comic book he was that dark and the cop told me we

[<a id="00-43-32">00:43:32</a>]  highly recommend you look at the pictures well like I told the cop police

[<a id="00-43-36">00:43:36</a>]  officer like I flew in all the way from state you know and yeah did to look at

[<a id="00-43-43">00:43:43</a>]  the picture where this this was his final few moments and he ended up like

[<a id="00-43-49">00:43:49</a>]  that you just wonder like he was a baby at one moment something happened from

[<a id="00-43-56">00:43:56</a>]  that day to 63 years later to where he ended up like that you know and I didn't

[<a id="00-44-01">00:44:01</a>]  really know him because my parents got divorced and even if I live with my dad

[<a id="00-44-04">00:44:04</a>]  he was never the kind of person open his mouth and say thing and growing up people

[<a id="00-44-09">00:44:09</a>]  were saying like why do you have to say that and stuff in public you know I

[<a id="00-44-12">00:44:12</a>]  think I think when my family got mad at me for saying something public it's it's

[<a id="00-44-18">00:44:18</a>]  just like I think I might have gone overdrive saying too much stuff because

[<a id="00-44-22">00:44:22</a>]  none of them say anything you know they will only show emotion when they're

[<a id="00-44-26">00:44:26</a>]  angry but they wouldn't show other sensitive emotions you know so I don't

[<a id="00-44-34">00:44:34</a>]  know my brother doesn't really say anything he keep everything to himself

[<a id="00-44-37">00:44:37</a>]  and I say too much sometimes but I do make a lot of joke about something

[<a id="00-44-43">00:44:43</a>]  tragic happened because I think a lot of times how do you process when some

[<a id="00-44-47">00:44:47</a>]  terrible thing happened like that you know too much of that will hurt you

[<a id="00-44-52">00:44:52</a>]  emotionally and if you're traumatized emotionally it may impact you physically

[<a id="00-44-57">00:44:57</a>]  too you know so I kind of jujitsu by saying something terrible that happened

[<a id="00-45-03">00:45:03</a>]  with something terrible I will say to manage that you know and sometimes

[<a id="00-45-10">00:45:10</a>]  people say that's bullshit but I don't know I when you work at porn shop when

[<a id="00-45-15">00:45:15</a>]  you work at the restaurant you sometimes deal with people stay up late and work

[<a id="00-45-20">00:45:20</a>]  they usually have jobs where something terrible happened all the time whether

[<a id="00-45-23">00:45:23</a>]  they're police or social workers or nurse or doctors and things like that

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  and they say terrible things not because they don't care because they have to say

[<a id="00-45-31">00:45:31</a>]  terrible things so they could continue to do good work you know how could you

[<a id="00-45-36">00:45:36</a>]  withstand constant bad thing happening or seeing things you know so I think

[<a id="00-45-40">00:45:40</a>]  they're just jujitsu in that kind of managing districts terrible things you

[<a id="00-45-47">00:45:47</a>]  know. I mean there's in times in my life where I was going through something and you realize there's a kind of a tyranny of niceness in the world so as long as you're in a happy space you're fine at the moment like I even see this with, I did a comedy show on Wednesday and there's a female comedian there she's like oh how are you and I wasn't in a good space I wasn't I was like yeah it wasn't a bad it was just a comedy show.

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  When you guys have conversations, is it in English or is it in German?

[<a id="00-46-03">00:46:03</a>]  There is a, actually we're going to maybe take you to this, there's a Tuesday night German show we're having to make because this is actually very funny, very funny, very funny, very funny.

[<a id="00-46-11">00:46:11</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-46-15">00:46:15</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-46-18">00:46:18</a>]  When you guys have conversations, is it in English or is it in German?

[<a id="00-46-25">00:46:25</a>]  There is a, actually we're going to maybe take you to this, there's a Tuesday night German show we're having to make because this is actually very funny, very funny, very funny, very funny, very funny, very funny.

[<a id="00-46-32">00:46:32</a>]  When you guys have conversations, is it in English or is it in German?

[<a id="00-46-39">00:46:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-46-41">00:46:41</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-46-51">00:46:51</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-47-00">00:47:00</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-04">00:47:04</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-06">00:47:06</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-11">00:47:11</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-22">00:47:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-31">00:47:31</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-33">00:47:33</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-47-39">00:47:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-44">00:47:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-51">00:47:51</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  And this is what in German show, German language show.

[<a id="00-48-12">00:48:12</a>]  I see.

[<a id="00-48-17">00:48:17</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-19">00:48:19</a>]  Uh huh.

[<a id="00-48-33">00:48:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-37">00:48:37</a>]  Is it mostly like a set up punch line jokes or is it like a stories?

[<a id="00-48-44">00:48:44</a>]  But I have respect for that.

[<a id="00-48-46">00:48:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-53">00:48:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-05">00:49:05</a>]  Or you're extremely confident and you know what you're doing.

[<a id="00-49-07">00:49:07</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-11">00:49:11</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-13">00:49:13</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-17">00:49:17</a>]  Like Norm Macdonald have a history of starting something, it goes long time, you don't even know if he's, where is it, where is this story going?

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  And of course he has a really funny punch line at the end of it.

[<a id="00-49-28">00:49:28</a>]  And people know that, so that's okay.

[<a id="00-49-32">00:49:32</a>]  Yeah, yeah, but if they don't know you, they're just like, where the fuck this is going?

[<a id="00-49-36">00:49:36</a>]  So one of the first things you learn is you get your first laugh quick.

[<a id="00-49-40">00:49:40</a>]  So the audience say, okay, this guy seems to be funny.

[<a id="00-49-43">00:49:43</a>]  You know what he's doing?

[<a id="00-49-44">00:49:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-45">00:49:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-46">00:49:46</a>]  And, and so I'm on the show.

[<a id="00-49-47">00:49:47</a>]  I got bumped.

[<a id="00-49-48">00:49:48</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  And so, uh, but I did, I got, I got my first life simply by just sighing into the mic.

[<a id="00-49-56">00:49:56</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-57">00:49:57</a>]  And I got a laugh immediately.

[<a id="00-49-59">00:49:59</a>]  This guy comes on taking my spot and then he proceeds to spend two minutes to get to his first laugh.

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  Is he a traditional stand-up or more acting?

[<a id="00-50-09">00:50:09</a>]  Uh, he's a stand-up on Swiss German TV.

[<a id="00-50-12">00:50:12</a>]  I see.

[<a id="00-50-13">00:50:13</a>]  And he occasionally does English and we can call it some comedy drama.

[<a id="00-50-17">00:50:17</a>]  He also, he showed up to an open mic doing, um, uh, who's the, who's the, uh, famous director married his stepdaughter.

[<a id="00-50-30">00:50:30</a>]  Oh, Woody Allen.

[<a id="00-50-31">00:50:31</a>]  Woody Allen.

[<a id="00-50-32">00:50:32</a>]  And Woody Allen used to be a stand-up.

[<a id="00-50-33">00:50:33</a>]  This guy was stealing Woody Allen's material and doing it on open mics.

[<a id="00-50-38">00:50:38</a>]  Really?

[<a id="00-50-39">00:50:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-50-40">00:50:40</a>]  He didn't think people that they know that or?

[<a id="00-50-42">00:50:42</a>]  All the comedians knew it anyway.

[<a id="00-50-44">00:50:44</a>]  And so we, he got caught.

[<a id="00-50-46">00:50:46</a>]  So he really is in comic then.

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  He's got his own material.

[<a id="00-50-49">00:50:49</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-50-50">00:50:50</a>]  Took him two minutes to get to it.

[<a id="00-50-51">00:50:51</a>]  And then the motherfucker comes up to me after taking my spot and goes, I really liked your set.

[<a id="00-50-55">00:50:55</a>]  I loved how you got them to laugh straight away.

[<a id="00-50-58">00:50:58</a>]  And I wanted to yell me, yes, motherfucker.

[<a id="00-51-01">00:51:01</a>]  That's cause I put the fucking work in to do it and you stole my spot.

[<a id="00-51-05">00:51:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-51-06">00:51:06</a>]  Thank you for your compliment.

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  And the next thing you know, he's doing your material.

[<a id="00-51-13">00:51:13</a>]  Well, mine, uh, mine you can't really cause it's a lot about my name being Harry Fox.

[<a id="00-51-20">00:51:20</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-51-21">00:51:21</a>]  And, and, uh, I've got two dreams in comedy.

[<a id="00-51-25">00:51:25</a>]  Number one would be to tour all the bars in America called Harry's Bar and just perform.

[<a id="00-51-32">00:51:32</a>]  Cause that's actually, you could, you could do most of America on that.

[<a id="00-51-37">00:51:37</a>]  There's bars called Harry's Bar?

[<a id="00-51-40">00:51:40</a>]  They're all over America.

[<a id="00-51-42">00:51:42</a>]  Oh, but they're not national change.

[<a id="00-51-44">00:51:44</a>]  Just some guy named Harry.

[<a id="00-51-45">00:51:45</a>]  It's always, in every town there's a Harry's Bar.

[<a id="00-51-48">00:51:48</a>]  Huh.

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  And it, and I mean, it would just be a funny thing to do.

[<a id="00-51-53">00:51:53</a>]  The other, and this one is, is just a weird fetish, but I would, I would love to be able

[<a id="00-51-58">00:51:58</a>]  to kill in one of the black rooms in New York, which I don't think is possible.

[<a id="00-52-02">00:52:02</a>]  Why?

[<a id="00-52-03">00:52:03</a>]  Cause I don't, maybe it is, but it would take me to do something I'm not doing right now.

[<a id="00-52-10">00:52:10</a>]  Because, uh.

[<a id="00-52-12">00:52:12</a>]  I noticed that, that to, to, to, to be successful in stand up comedy, it's very similar with

[<a id="00-52-17">00:52:17</a>]  pornography.

[<a id="00-52-19">00:52:19</a>]  You have to go through black people.

[<a id="00-52-22">00:52:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-52-24">00:52:24</a>]  You know what I mean?

[<a id="00-52-26">00:52:26</a>]  The black guys are tough and then black, black performers are like, you know.

[<a id="00-52-32">00:52:32</a>]  You've done some, some, yeah.

[<a id="00-52-34">00:52:34</a>]  I don't know if it's right.

[<a id="00-52-35">00:52:35</a>]  Do you know how that's called black rooms?

[<a id="00-52-38">00:52:38</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-52-39">00:52:39</a>]  That's what it is.

[<a id="00-52-40">00:52:40</a>]  I've done them before.

[<a id="00-52-41">00:52:41</a>]  And then I've seen enough crazy stuff on stage.

[<a id="00-52-43">00:52:43</a>]  They go, especially if I'm bashing like white people, which is like pandering to them, but

[<a id="00-52-47">00:52:47</a>]  they love that kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-52-48">00:52:48</a>]  You know?

[<a id="00-52-49">00:52:49</a>]  So I got a pen, I got a shit on my, I got a shit on my rights basically.

[<a id="00-52-54">00:52:54</a>]  Uh, in a reasonable way.

[<a id="00-52-56">00:52:56</a>]  You don't want to go overboard like, you know, you being ridiculous or something like that.

[<a id="00-53-00">00:53:00</a>]  But, um, you know who's really good?

[<a id="00-53-02">00:53:02</a>]  It's Matt Rife.

[<a id="00-53-03">00:53:03</a>]  He's, he, I think he grew up with a lot of black people, so he's very comfortable around

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  them.

[<a id="00-53-08">00:53:08</a>]  You know?

[<a id="00-53-09">00:53:09</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-10">00:53:10</a>]  I mean, they're like any other people.

[<a id="00-53-12">00:53:12</a>]  They have sense of humor, you know, like if you, if you say something funny, they're cool

[<a id="00-53-16">00:53:16</a>]  with it, you know?

[<a id="00-53-17">00:53:17</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-18">00:53:18</a>]  I was thinking maybe the way to play it would be to lean into the, I am the patriarchy and

[<a id="00-53-24">00:53:24</a>]  I'm what everybody hates.

[<a id="00-53-26">00:53:26</a>]  I'm an old white man at this point.

[<a id="00-53-28">00:53:28</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-53-29">00:53:29</a>]  And I didn't get any benefits because I'm stupid, but.

[<a id="00-53-34">00:53:34</a>]  But there's plenty other white comic that don't do that, but they just know how to read

[<a id="00-53-39">00:53:39</a>]  the room and they do extremely well too.

[<a id="00-53-41">00:53:41</a>]  I think, I think sometimes when you would like death comedy jam or something, you think

[<a id="00-53-46">00:53:46</a>]  black audience a certain way, but like I've done plenty of room, like they're like, they're

[<a id="00-53-50">00:53:50</a>]  not like that at all.

[<a id="00-53-52">00:53:52</a>]  Like they're like regular people.

[<a id="00-53-55">00:53:55</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-56">00:53:56</a>]  I mean, those kind of like, uh, Martin Lawrence used to do those crazy room and like the whole

[<a id="00-54-00">00:54:00</a>]  room was like, you know, but Martin Lawrence would say some crazy as raunchy, funny stuff

[<a id="00-54-06">00:54:06</a>]  in the room go crazy.

[<a id="00-54-07">00:54:07</a>]  Like frenzy, right?

[<a id="00-54-08">00:54:08</a>]  It's funny show.

[<a id="00-54-09">00:54:09</a>]  He's, he, he know that room, you know, that too, but there's plenty of like quiet, respecting

[<a id="00-54-15">00:54:15</a>]  black people.

[<a id="00-54-16">00:54:16</a>]  Like just like regular people, you know?

[<a id="00-54-18">00:54:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-54-19">00:54:19</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-54-20">00:54:20</a>]  So it depends on the room or where you're at, you know, Apollo theater in New York city.

[<a id="00-54-25">00:54:25</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-54-26">00:54:26</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-54-27">00:54:27</a>]  But you can't lose because if you go up in bomb, it's kind of funny story.

[<a id="00-54-33">00:54:33</a>]  And if you do well, you did well, you know, but that's the thing with the standup comic.

[<a id="00-54-38">00:54:38</a>]  Like you're, it's a win-win situation.

[<a id="00-54-41">00:54:41</a>]  If you're talking about in the stage, if you did well, you did well.

[<a id="00-54-45">00:54:45</a>]  If you did bad, it's a funny story, you know?

[<a id="00-54-48">00:54:48</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-54-49">00:54:49</a>]  So, um, so you talk a little about your parents and you're working in UK.

[<a id="00-55-00">00:55:00</a>]  Why did you choose to come to Switzerland or did you meet somebody and you decided to move

[<a id="00-55-06">00:55:06</a>]  here?

[<a id="00-55-07">00:55:07</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-55-08">00:55:08</a>]  There's a part where there's also, I went to a Quaker boarding school, 11 and 18.

[<a id="00-55-13">00:55:13</a>]  We can, before we rushed to this, you know, you know who the Quakers are?

[<a id="00-55-18">00:55:18</a>]  Of course.

[<a id="00-55-19">00:55:19</a>]  Richard Nixon.

[<a id="00-55-20">00:55:20</a>]  Richard Nixon was a Quaker.

[<a id="00-55-22">00:55:22</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-55-23">00:55:23</a>]  Can't you tell when he was bombing all those people?

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-55-26">00:55:26</a>]  He was a Quaker.

[<a id="00-55-27">00:55:27</a>]  Well, he was brought up one.

[<a id="00-55-29">00:55:29</a>]  Orange County.

[<a id="00-55-30">00:55:30</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-55-31">00:55:31</a>]  So, so yeah, so like the English side of my family were Quakers.

[<a id="00-55-38">00:55:38</a>]  It's a variant of Protestantism, but, uh, there, I know there are very much like, uh,

[<a id="00-55-44">00:55:44</a>]  anti-war obviously, anti-violence.

[<a id="00-55-46">00:55:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-55-47">00:55:47</a>]  They had, there's a bunch of stuff.

[<a id="00-55-48">00:55:48</a>]  They're actually pretty interesting to say, like, I mean, I went, I was, it was a weak,

[<a id="00-55-53">00:55:53</a>]  the weak Quakers cause the strong ones all went to America, but the ones who stayed in

[<a id="00-55-59">00:55:59</a>]  America were either rich or not that.

[<a id="00-56-03">00:56:03</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-04">00:56:04</a>]  But, um, but basically, uh, the Quakers, they, uh, I don't know what it's like, uh, it's

[<a id="00-56-12">00:56:12</a>]  like when, you know, when you go, I kept thinking Amish, but that's not the same thing, you

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  know, there was some similarity, but it's a bit like, you know, when a musical genre

[<a id="00-56-25">00:56:25</a>]  goes back to basics, like you have disco and then you have rap.

[<a id="00-56-29">00:56:29</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-30">00:56:30</a>]  Uh, cause like disco is getting too fancy.

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-33">00:56:33</a>]  Too gay.

[<a id="00-56-34">00:56:34</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-35">00:56:35</a>]  Too.

[<a id="00-56-36">00:56:36</a>]  And, and I think that's where the Quakers come from.

[<a id="00-56-37">00:56:37</a>]  So they're like.

[<a id="00-56-38">00:56:38</a>]  You got too gay.

[<a id="00-56-39">00:56:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-40">00:56:40</a>]  The church got too gay.

[<a id="00-56-41">00:56:41</a>]  They're like, we can't be just working little boys all the time.

[<a id="00-56-42">00:56:42</a>]  We've got to get back to basics.

[<a id="00-56-43">00:56:43</a>]  And the way I think they began in the 18th century, some of the things they, they didn't

[<a id="00-56-44">00:56:44</a>]  have churches.

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  They had a meeting house.

[<a id="00-56-46">00:56:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-47">00:56:47</a>]  They, they didn't have, uh, any, they didn't like a dorm, not in the meeting house, just

[<a id="00-57-02">00:57:02</a>]  sure.

[<a id="00-57-03">00:57:03</a>]  Uh, they'd wear like boring clothes.

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  They were extremely honest.

[<a id="00-57-05">00:57:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-57-06">00:57:06</a>]  Like, like insanely honest.

[<a id="00-57-07">00:57:07</a>]  Like, I remember my grandmother telling me a story, a cousin of hers wanted to stay with

[<a id="00-57-08">00:57:08</a>]  another part of the family.

[<a id="00-57-09">00:57:09</a>]  And so he writes some a letter saying, can I come and visit this summer?

[<a id="00-57-22">00:57:22</a>]  And they write a letter back and say, uh, no, we don't really like you, so you can't

[<a id="00-57-30">00:57:30</a>]  stay.

[<a id="00-57-31">00:57:31</a>]  And that was a reply.

[<a id="00-57-32">00:57:32</a>]  It was like radical honesty.

[<a id="00-57-33">00:57:33</a>]  But what that led to, it led them to firstly, the Quakers invented the idea of price tags,

[<a id="00-57-34">00:57:34</a>]  of saying this is the price of something that is not negotiable, because they felt negotiating

[<a id="00-57-44">00:57:44</a>]  was lying.

[<a id="00-57-45">00:57:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-57-46">00:57:46</a>]  And then the other thing is that they became super successful in banking because people

[<a id="00-57-47">00:57:47</a>]  trusted them with money.

[<a id="00-57-48">00:57:48</a>]  And then that killed religion because they got too wealthy.

[<a id="00-57-57">00:57:57</a>]  Um, so from 11 to 18 years old, you were staying in like a Quaker facility?

[<a id="00-58-03">00:58:03</a>]  So I would be there for everything, except the holidays, I'd be home for Christmas, Easter,

[<a id="00-58-07">00:58:07</a>]  summer.

[<a id="00-58-08">00:58:08</a>]  It's a place that you could go to school to?

[<a id="00-58-13">00:58:13</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-14">00:58:14</a>]  I'd be sleeping there.

[<a id="00-58-15">00:58:15</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-16">00:58:16</a>]  And there was about 300 kids there.

[<a id="00-58-17">00:58:17</a>]  I was very homesick for the first sort of year or two.

[<a id="00-58-24">00:58:24</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-25">00:58:25</a>]  But then as I started to hit puberty, and you have your buddies.

[<a id="00-58-31">00:58:31</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-32">00:58:32</a>]  And it started to be.

[<a id="00-58-33">00:58:33</a>]  And this is where I realized also how these boarding schools breed spines, because they

[<a id="00-58-34">00:58:34</a>]  started to develop.

[<a id="00-58-35">00:58:35</a>]  Wait, I want to hear this.

[<a id="00-58-36">00:58:36</a>]  What's the theory?

[<a id="00-58-37">00:58:37</a>]  Um, you develop multiple personas very quickly.

[<a id="00-58-38">00:58:38</a>]  Because at boarding school, the beautiful thing is you can do bullshit, break the rules,

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  but you're not judged as a person, you're just punished for breaking the rules of the

[<a id="00-58-40">00:58:40</a>]  system.

[<a id="00-58-41">00:58:41</a>]  So as long as you don't get caught, you're fine.

[<a id="00-58-42">00:58:42</a>]  If you get caught, nobody tells you you're a horrible human being.

[<a id="00-59-06">00:59:06</a>]  They just say, "Now you're going to have to do this punishment you're going to do."

[<a id="00-59-22">00:59:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-23">00:59:23</a>]  And so I developed sort of teenage boy evil, and I was drinking and smoking weed and fucking

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  around.

[<a id="00-59-25">00:59:25</a>]  Where in the UK is this?

[<a id="00-59-26">00:59:26</a>]  Near Bristol.

[<a id="00-59-27">00:59:27</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-59-28">00:59:28</a>]  And I actually took my kids to see the school over the summer.

[<a id="00-59-29">00:59:29</a>]  And then I'd go home and I'd be like the nice, sweet boy that my family liked.

[<a id="00-59-30">00:59:30</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-31">00:59:31</a>]  And just play that role.

[<a id="00-59-37">00:59:37</a>]  And the extreme form of this is the type of schools that Prince Charles, like Eton is

[<a id="00-59-50">00:59:50</a>]  the famous boarding school in England.

[<a id="00-59-51">00:59:51</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-59-52">00:59:52</a>]  It's a military school where Duke Wellington learned to beat Napoleon.

[<a id="00-59-53">00:59:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-54">00:59:54</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-55">00:59:55</a>]  And also the spies come out of this and then they get recruited at Oxford and Cambridge.

[<a id="00-59-56">00:59:56</a>]  But it's because you're developing the ability to hide a bunch of stuff and give people what

[<a id="01-00-09">01:00:09</a>]  they want.

[<a id="01-00-10">01:00:10</a>]  So-

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  I'm sure in those situations you learn right away social status and how to maintain social

[<a id="01-00-17">01:00:17</a>]  status and stay in the right group and, yeah.

[<a id="01-00-21">01:00:21</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-22">01:00:22</a>]  And multiple things.

[<a id="01-00-23">01:00:23</a>]  I mean, one thing is-

[<a id="01-00-25">01:00:25</a>]  They don't have any boarding school in this fucking country.

[<a id="01-00-28">01:00:28</a>]  In Switzerland, though.

[<a id="01-00-30">01:00:30</a>]  This is where all the Kim Jong-un got sent.

[<a id="01-00-34">01:00:34</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-35">01:00:35</a>]  But, I mean, one of the interesting things to me was I got to see girls from a young

[<a id="01-00-48">01:00:48</a>]  age.

[<a id="01-00-49">01:00:49</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-50">01:00:50</a>]  We had separate dormitories.

[<a id="01-00-51">01:00:51</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-52">01:00:52</a>]  And what's fascinating to me is that I could spend, like, my friends at home-

[<a id="01-00-57">01:00:57</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-58">01:00:58</a>]  They only got to see girls during school hours.

[<a id="01-00-59">01:00:59</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-01-00">01:01:00</a>]  When they were wearing the makeup-

[<a id="01-01-01">01:01:01</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-01-02">01:01:02</a>]  And presenting themselves.

[<a id="01-01-03">01:01:03</a>]  I got to see girls from early morning through to evening.

[<a id="01-01-04">01:01:04</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-01-05">01:01:05</a>]  And also there were these two girls, or the two alpha girls, in my year.

[<a id="01-01-06">01:01:06</a>]  And I saw the evil shit that they were doing to each other.

[<a id="01-01-07">01:01:07</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-01-08">01:01:08</a>]  And it was fascinating.

[<a id="01-01-09">01:01:09</a>]  Because I wasn't- they weren't interested in me.

[<a id="01-01-10">01:01:10</a>]  I was a bit of a weird geeky kid.

[<a id="01-01-11">01:01:11</a>]  And they weren't interested in me.

[<a id="01-01-12">01:01:12</a>]  I was a bit of a weird geeky kid.

[<a id="01-01-13">01:01:13</a>]  And they weren't interested in me.

[<a id="01-01-14">01:01:14</a>]  And they weren't interested in me.

[<a id="01-01-15">01:01:15</a>]  And they weren't interested in me.

[<a id="01-01-16">01:01:16</a>]  And they weren't interested in me.

[<a id="01-01-17">01:01:17</a>]  I was a bit of a weird geeky kid.

[<a id="01-01-22">01:01:22</a>]  And these two girls, they had their two groups of dudes.

[<a id="01-01-26">01:01:26</a>]  And they would convince these dudes to fight-

[<a id="01-01-27">01:01:27</a>]  Each other.

[<a id="01-01-28">01:01:28</a>]  It's like, you see, they were two warring generals.

[<a id="01-01-29">01:01:29</a>]  And they were just- and what would happen is, like, we'd come up going crying, and all

[<a id="01-01-30">01:01:30</a>]  the guys going, "Oh, what's happened?

[<a id="01-01-31">01:01:31</a>]  What's happened?"

[<a id="01-01-32">01:01:32</a>]  "Oh, I don't want to tell you."

[<a id="01-01-33">01:01:33</a>]  "No, no.

[<a id="01-01-34">01:01:34</a>]  You should tell us."

[<a id="01-01-35">01:01:35</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-36">01:01:36</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-37">01:01:37</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-38">01:01:38</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-39">01:01:39</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-40">01:01:40</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-51">01:01:51</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-54">01:01:54</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-57">01:01:57</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-58">01:01:58</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-01-59">01:01:59</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-00">01:02:00</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-01">01:02:01</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-02">01:02:02</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-03">01:02:03</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-04">01:02:04</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-05">01:02:05</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-06">01:02:06</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-25">01:02:25</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-26">01:02:26</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-27">01:02:27</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-28">01:02:28</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-30">01:02:30</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-31">01:02:31</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-32">01:02:32</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-33">01:02:33</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-35">01:02:35</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-36">01:02:36</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-37">01:02:37</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-38">01:02:38</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-39">01:02:39</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-40">01:02:40</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-41">01:02:41</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-42">01:02:42</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-03-06">01:03:06</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-03-32">01:03:32</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-04-00">01:04:00</a>]  "Oh, well, you know, that bitch did the right thing."

[<a id="01-04-29">01:04:29</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-04-40">01:04:40</a>]  How much time is the second time we've done?

[<a id="01-04-50">01:04:50</a>]  I'm really fading.

[<a id="01-04-51">01:04:51</a>]  I'm feeling it.

[<a id="01-04-53">01:04:53</a>]  We could do another one tomorrow, but just maybe 30 minutes.

[<a id="01-04-56">01:04:56</a>]  I will ask you, like, after that Quaker, and then how did you end up here, and how did

[<a id="01-05-03">01:05:03</a>]  you get into comedy, and where you're at.

[<a id="01-05-06">01:05:06</a>]  Sorry, I'm fading.
