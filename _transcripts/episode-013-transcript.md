[<a id="00-01-12">00:01:12</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-01-13">00:01:13</a>]  Today this is because this is sponsored this podcast is sponsored by Vitamin Well and they

[<a id="00-01-22">00:01:22</a>]  make these drinks.

[<a id="00-01-23">00:01:23</a>]  There's actually a Coca-Cola company they just put a word on there.

[<a id="00-01-27">00:01:27</a>]  Are you just joking.

[<a id="00-01-28">00:01:28</a>]  And I just believe this word like reload and you drink it and you're reloaded.

[<a id="00-01-32">00:01:32</a>]  It's great for American school children.

[<a id="00-01-35">00:01:35</a>]  Yes they have one of those before any of skill shooting starts you got to get fuck and you

[<a id="00-01-45">00:01:45</a>]  got any recording.

[<a id="00-01-46">00:01:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-47">00:01:47</a>]  You got another one.

[<a id="00-01-48">00:01:48</a>]  Vitamin Well hide what's funny is also there's this other one always a recording it is oh

[<a id="00-02-03">00:02:03</a>]  I think you didn't do that shit so that's what I didn't actually the other one is the

[<a id="00-02-09">00:02:09</a>]  other vitamin company says basically it's a new Pepsi-Cola war you know the one there's

[<a id="00-02-17">00:02:17</a>]  Vitamin Well and some other companies selling these like water with flavor and they're clearly

[<a id="00-02-23">00:02:23</a>]  in like the two marketing teams at war with each other.

[<a id="00-02-27">00:02:27</a>]  So the other companies now also create one called Reload and just fucking water.

[<a id="00-02-34">00:02:34</a>]  Yeah but you can just imagine because you know how corporations are they call it Reload

[<a id="00-02-40">00:02:40</a>]  as well.

[<a id="00-02-41">00:02:41</a>]  How can we stop them.

[<a id="00-02-42">00:02:42</a>]  That's bullshit.

[<a id="00-02-43">00:02:43</a>]  Like we've worked ages to come up with the word Reload.

[<a id="00-02-48">00:02:48</a>]  Probably come up with a stupid word that they're making up so they can brand it Reloadish or

[<a id="00-02-54">00:02:54</a>]  something.

[<a id="00-02-55">00:02:55</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-02-56">00:02:56</a>]  It's pretty good.

[<a id="00-02-57">00:02:57</a>]  Speaking of Reload.

[<a id="00-02-58">00:02:58</a>]  You're going to Kiev soon.

[<a id="00-02-59">00:02:59</a>]  December 1st and it's been a bit of Reload for me because I think I think pretty much

[<a id="00-03-10">00:03:10</a>]  the same routine for the last six months it was really nice to come here I mean I wasn't

[<a id="00-03-14">00:03:14</a>]  sure what's going to happen and just like you didn't know when I show up like you don't

[<a id="00-03-19">00:03:19</a>]  really know someone until you stay with them and you've been very gracious host and both

[<a id="00-03-27">00:03:27</a>]  of you and but a bigger risk for him because I'm staying at his place you know you know

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  I could have been Klaus Kinski remember how he destroyed Werner Herzog's apartment but

[<a id="00-03-40">00:03:40</a>]  yeah I'll say this much I'm not a very hopeful person but I do feel a little bit of hopeful

[<a id="00-03-47">00:03:47</a>]  for next year and what we need what I need to do for next year.

[<a id="00-03-51">00:03:51</a>]  So you're feeling hopeful for you not for the world because that bitch is burning.

[<a id="00-04-00">00:04:00</a>]  It's not as bad as people think it is what's going on in the world because I've been places

[<a id="00-04-05">00:04:05</a>]  like Afghanistan and people surprise you like some of the most kindness people with so little

[<a id="00-04-12">00:04:12</a>]  resource will be going out away to make sure you're fed and things like that you know.

[<a id="00-04-16">00:04:16</a>]  I think what's going on in some of the world it's the West.

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  We are it's over for us with this this close to being fully over.

[<a id="00-04-27">00:04:27</a>]  I think I notice that people who read too much newspaper they follow that stuff too

[<a id="00-04-35">00:04:35</a>]  much.

[<a id="00-04-36">00:04:36</a>]  Watch TV about that stuff read less of the podcast and just hang out with the big same

[<a id="00-04-40">00:04:40</a>]  way.

[<a id="00-04-41">00:04:41</a>]  They were completely still shocked at 2024 Trump won whereas people we meet people who

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  are practical like even like engineers people who deal with the real thing with doctors

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  whatever they kind of you know they do pay attention to a little bit of media or whatever

[<a id="00-04-56">00:04:56</a>]  but they're busy with the real world shit.

[<a id="00-04-59">00:04:59</a>]  They were not completely surprised at all.

[<a id="00-05-01">00:05:01</a>]  So depends on what you're talking to you it's every time when people say it's end of the

[<a id="00-05-07">00:05:07</a>]  world I've been to those places you know I mean every time I went to Paris what it was

[<a id="00-05-11">00:05:11</a>]  it don't go to the black area and when I go to black area they say don't go to white area

[<a id="00-05-15">00:05:15</a>]  but I go both places no no issues you know a lot of it is terrible things just imaginary.

[<a id="00-05-20">00:05:20</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-21">00:05:21</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-22">00:05:22</a>]  But is there anti-semitism sure but is it as much as people claim in media fuck no no

[<a id="00-05-29">00:05:29</a>]  you know like most people even Afghanistan for pretending Muslims they have no idea what

[<a id="00-05-34">00:05:34</a>]  Jews look like.

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  They have no idea.

[<a id="00-05-36">00:05:36</a>]  Look they don't recognize those pointy ears and no no it's not pointy ears the horns it's

[<a id="00-05-46">00:05:46</a>]  the horns and they're unknowing.

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  No but I just think like whatever because I think look I read a lot but like the problem

[<a id="00-06-00">00:06:00</a>]  with my friends they're not A to Z when I say A to Z I used to go to library I would

[<a id="00-06-05">00:06:05</a>]  literally go to section A and go all the way to Z because I had no money I stayed all day

[<a id="00-06-10">00:06:10</a>]  reading different magazines and shit and newspapers you know so I wasn't I wasn't prejudiced about

[<a id="00-06-14">00:06:14</a>]  it but these days there's no algorithm when you go to library picking up magazines right

[<a id="00-06-20">00:06:20</a>]  like I'm gonna read everything I'm trying not to be biased I mean that's not why but

[<a id="00-06-25">00:06:25</a>]  like I don't know anything about this when I look at it you know so I just kind of go

[<a id="00-06-28">00:06:28</a>]  even like a wedding magazine right in a horse riding I have no interest but I figured like

[<a id="00-06-34">00:06:34</a>]  I should read it because my dad always said even if you meet a stupidest person that person

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  knows something that you don't know so why don't you talk to everyone who's it who's

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  a comedian I'm talking about last time the guy that did pimpology and this black comedian

[<a id="00-06-50">00:06:50</a>]  who was Patrice not Patrice nice oh uh Kat Williams Kat Williams yeah that means you're

[<a id="00-06-56">00:06:56</a>]  a bit like Kat Williams he's talking like I'm not sure well he the guys are practically

[<a id="00-07-03">00:07:03</a>]  a midget yeah I like I don't know who's I don't know who's shorter him or uh Kevin

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  Hart they're they're pretty close their egos are fucking massive though yeah yeah yeah

[<a id="00-07-15">00:07:15</a>]  they have to I saw Kat Williams one time I didn't know who he was um one of the men

[<a id="00-07-22">00:07:22</a>]  from Living Colors was there I said can I take pictures oh no you should take a picture

[<a id="00-07-27">00:07:27</a>]  with him his bigger star like oh really I took him but he didn't he didn't smile he

[<a id="00-07-31">00:07:31</a>]  didn't want to take a picture with Ching Chong that's beyond us but the thing the thing is

[<a id="00-07-34">00:07:34</a>]  he talks about that as well like he his childhood and then uh he left home and he's just reading

[<a id="00-07-41">00:07:41</a>]  he just said he he lived in a park and he'd go into the library all day and read yeah

[<a id="00-07-46">00:07:46</a>]  I think he exaggerated a number of books he read but I understand he's emotionally right

[<a id="00-07-50">00:07:50</a>]  about that stuff yeah yeah no he's undeniable I mean I wouldn't watch I wouldn't sit there

[<a id="00-07-55">00:07:55</a>]  and watch him just stand up because I don't I don't particularly I don't know unless it's

[<a id="00-07-59">00:07:59</a>]  like Patrice or like Chappelle Rock there's one other black comedian in Atlanta that nobody

[<a id="00-08-06">00:08:06</a>]  I forgot his name but he had this amazing thoughtful clever jokes I forgot his name

[<a id="00-08-12">00:08:12</a>]  but he's just phenomenal but other than that you know death comedy jam it's kind of fun

[<a id="00-08-17">00:08:17</a>]  I guess when you're young but uh it's just too loud you know because I got ringing shit

[<a id="00-08-22">00:08:22</a>]  so I don't like I don't like loudness for sake of loudness I don't like that kind of

[<a id="00-08-26">00:08:26</a>]  show so I don't listen but just talking quietly and podcast he's mesmerizing yeah he's captivating

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  man yeah sometimes I don't think people should read that much I know what you're saying with

[<a id="00-09-26">00:09:26</a>]  I was wrong about that shit you know like oh I'm wrong all the time yeah for sure I know

[<a id="00-09-33">00:09:33</a>]  that I'm wrong all the time I've been yeah taught by time and time again I'm not a great

[<a id="00-09-38">00:09:38</a>]  investor I have been wrong about the market many a time yeah um that's why I I don't do

[<a id="00-09-46">00:09:46</a>]  that anymore so I know that I'm wrong but it's youtube is this crazy place now where

[<a id="00-09-54">00:09:54</a>]  if you're wrong but if your theory sounds interesting yeah yeah you hit the fucking

[<a id="00-09-58">00:09:58</a>]  views uh I think I think to be reasonable you've got to look because you know I think

[<a id="00-10-03">00:10:03</a>]  maybe I was never I never auditioned for comedy seller and I was never part of it but when

[<a id="00-10-08">00:10:08</a>]  I used to go there like 15 18 years ago when I meet these great comedians just listen to

[<a id="00-10-13">00:10:13</a>]  them you just be careful what you say because soon as they say something stupid they're

[<a id="00-10-17">00:10:17</a>]  like vipers you know just going to be all over you so I think that helped me that like

[<a id="00-10-22">00:10:22</a>]  um don't assume everything I think is right because I think I've been wrong a lot of times

[<a id="00-10-27">00:10:27</a>]  sports betting really reminds you how wrong I am many times so um I think it's it's good

[<a id="00-10-35">00:10:35</a>]  to be humble but you just know but get this I want to I want to go into the sports betting

[<a id="00-10-40">00:10:40</a>]  because I I had a moment there where I really thought I'm invincible so a few years ago

[<a id="00-10-46">00:10:46</a>]  I met the guy um uk-based guy who literally lifts up sports betting and he basically said

[<a id="00-10-53">00:10:53</a>]  like I only need to be right slightly more than 50 that is true and then I'm making money

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  well it is it is actually a bit more than 51 percent because um the the margins for

[<a id="00-11-06">00:11:06</a>]  your bets um are quite high especially when you play on the on the end result anyway so

[<a id="00-11-15">00:11:15</a>]  I'm part of like a tipping competition for Australian rules yeah I have done that for

[<a id="00-11-20">00:11:20</a>]  years in 2016 I completely blew it out of the park I was like in the top 10 of Australia

[<a id="00-11-26">00:11:26</a>]  in the whole country of the whole country yeah yeah in one season I'm giving credit

[<a id="00-11-31">00:11:31</a>]  for that some swiss guy and I literally did it mathematically this was the 2016 season

[<a id="00-11-39">00:11:39</a>]  um my team won yeah um and I was kind of like riding that wave especially yeah and then

[<a id="00-11-46">00:11:46</a>]  the next year I was like all right now I have to place real money on this because I know

[<a id="00-11-48">00:11:48</a>]  how this shit works now fuck me I was humbled as you said yeah within the first seven rounds

[<a id="00-11-56">00:11:56</a>]  it was like fucked completely gone you know what happened um when the COVID started um

[<a id="00-12-03">00:12:03</a>]  I had a little money because government was sending money and stuff like that you know

[<a id="00-12-07">00:12:07</a>]  and then then then summer of 2000 um I had this really suspicious feeling because this

[<a id="00-12-13">00:12:13</a>]  is the first time in sports betting this COVID thing happened I don't think casinos were

[<a id="00-12-19">00:12:19</a>]  able to factor in all the different things to figure out the spread and things like that

[<a id="00-12-23">00:12:23</a>]  yeah so um I was locked up in medical study at the time like a week before the season

[<a id="00-12-28">00:12:28</a>]  started so I put like 200 250 dollars and I made a bet and uh for college of all sports

[<a id="00-12-35">00:12:35</a>]  I don't know anything about that but like I just uh I had this inkling that um how would

[<a id="00-12-42">00:12:42</a>]  it calculate because there's something like this that this skill has never happened and

[<a id="00-12-46">00:12:46</a>]  how would it know these things had how much impact in different teams and different sports

[<a id="00-12-50">00:12:50</a>]  and things like that you know so I put money and uh I've been up all night and by the time

[<a id="00-12-57">00:12:57</a>]  I got up and by the time they they had to wake me up to take blood draw I woke up there's

[<a id="00-13-02">00:13:02</a>]  like five thousand dollar there holy shit yeah I mean I don't even follow college sports

[<a id="00-13-07">00:13:07</a>]  and then next day um and after all they didn't know how to factor in too and it got to the

[<a id="00-13-14">00:13:14</a>]  point like maybe 25,000 something of course I made a really bad mistake I lost it all

[<a id="00-13-18">00:13:18</a>]  um because you start thinking but the reason I'm telling you is this it's like last night

[<a id="00-13-26">00:13:26</a>]  oh didn't like that joke it's like every joke I just gamble oh they laughed at that they

[<a id="00-13-30">00:13:30</a>]  must see I make this terrible mistake yeah okay they laughed at the first rape joke clearly

[<a id="00-13-37">00:13:37</a>]  they're like the second rate and of course a couple days later you know you're just the

[<a id="00-13-41">00:13:41</a>]  third rate joke like yeah but it is a it is kind of game thing too you know because I

[<a id="00-13-48">00:13:48</a>]  think uh you got to remind yourself it's like this disclaimer in financial documents or

[<a id="00-13-55">00:13:55</a>]  in average financial advertising past performance is not indicative of future performance yes

[<a id="00-13-59">00:13:59</a>]  that is true especially with sports betting because like not nothing nothing is true and

[<a id="00-14-04">00:14:04</a>]  I found it fascinating with the Trump election because the Trump election was the first political

[<a id="00-14-09">00:14:09</a>]  election where you were able to place bets that so they've never been in before too huh

[<a id="00-14-15">00:14:15</a>]  I thought it was only legalized for this election no no no um I remember um the odds for Biden

[<a id="00-14-22">00:14:22</a>]  like uh not quite a year before but it was like 25 to one or something like it was something

[<a id="00-14-30">00:14:30</a>]  crazy like that because he but what happened was by the time I remember that number he

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  went to North or South Carolina and behind the doors that's when he made a deal with

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  black leaders and look you support me I will put a black woman so like within the next

[<a id="00-14-46">00:14:46</a>]  thing you know it they were doing all kinds of dirty shit where he got nomination and

[<a id="00-14-50">00:14:50</a>]  you know the odds were great with 25 to one on I mean I don't remember the odds but before

[<a id="00-14-56">00:14:56</a>]  he went North or South Carolina I remember yeah so they were betting before you could

[<a id="00-15-00">00:15:00</a>]  bet on anything there's a bet for like George Clooney becoming president like hundred to

[<a id="00-15-04">00:15:04</a>]  one and shit like that for sure it's um I might have my this is why I'm wrong all the

[<a id="00-15-09">00:15:09</a>]  time so I might have my fans there was like a there was a bet I know I was really ashamed

[<a id="00-15-13">00:15:13</a>]  for a reason because I just gambled shit just following I mean this is the thing that's

[<a id="00-15-18">00:15:18</a>]  why I don't wear condoms I gamble that's more like a Russian roulette yeah yeah the condoms

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  are for gay homosexuals I think the thing the the thing with with anything involving

[<a id="00-15-33">00:15:33</a>]  numbers it should be pure logic and I think that's a mistake most people make because

[<a id="00-15-37">00:15:37</a>]  you start it's not logical at all you start off with a logical approach with no no much

[<a id="00-15-43">00:15:43</a>]  money then you start to get some success and you get the endorphins kicking that's where

[<a id="00-15-47">00:15:47</a>]  you get stupid and that's where you lose everything and it's the same that's you know we got crypto

[<a id="00-15-54">00:15:54</a>]  is rising up and I haven't looked at this thing for like months because it's like it's

[<a id="00-15-59">00:15:59</a>]  it's so depressing I was depressed but now I've got to check on it every like two hours

[<a id="00-16-03">00:16:03</a>]  to see what's going on and the fact that I'm doing that is just feeding this addictive

[<a id="00-16-09">00:16:09</a>]  loop where I'm gonna I'm gonna fuck this up it's irrational because Chinese like other

[<a id="00-16-16">00:16:16</a>]  Asian folks have a reputation really good with math and science they are for generous

[<a id="00-16-21">00:16:21</a>]  speaking especially the one that they sent over to West famously you guys are gonna stop

[<a id="00-16-28">00:16:28</a>]  accepting Chinese students at the ETH schools in places like that but it's funny Chinese

[<a id="00-16-33">00:16:33</a>]  are very really good with math when it except when you go to casino they become irrational

[<a id="00-16-38">00:16:38</a>]  like oh red is a good luck number is a good luck number so it's really weird there's a

[<a id="00-16-43">00:16:43</a>]  like emotional thing you know who's really was a really big sports gambler norm re yeah

[<a id="00-16-52">00:16:52</a>]  oh my god no one was a good degenerate sports gambler but but he was almost rushing when

[<a id="00-16-58">00:16:58</a>]  it comes to that because you know when you read Dostoevsky's book he's so religious and

[<a id="00-17-03">00:17:03</a>]  he was a heavy gambler too because to him gambling was almost like a spiritual thing

[<a id="00-17-09">00:17:09</a>]  leave a fate like okay the odds are really really against you like he's suffering and

[<a id="00-17-14">00:17:14</a>]  that's why I think I heard I even heard I don't know if it's true but somebody that

[<a id="00-17-18">00:17:18</a>]  already laying somebody one time when no one was going through a refrigerator he forgot

[<a id="00-17-23">00:17:23</a>]  he left the $25,000 in back because he didn't want to spend that money already or somebody

[<a id="00-17-28">00:17:28</a>]  famous said they went to the beach he just throw the money in the ocean like that it's

[<a id="00-17-32">00:17:32</a>]  what are you doing like well I'm gonna lose it anyway so so getting back into the Yoshi

[<a id="00-17-39">00:17:39</a>]  over Yoshi story so you were good at maths no I'm not but but you got you studied like

[<a id="00-17-46">00:17:46</a>]  after you finished school you got into economics right or you studied no no no I was good with

[<a id="00-17-51">00:17:51</a>]  math because a student in fourth grade in the United States were so behind but by the

[<a id="00-17-56">00:17:56</a>]  time I had like six or seven everybody caught up in Japan they just beat the shit out of

[<a id="00-18-00">00:18:00</a>]  you with that stuff yeah I studied econ not a mathematical part I really enjoyed the night

[<a id="00-18-07">00:18:07</a>]  different way of thinking in economics you know I remember with that teacher that I had

[<a id="00-18-12">00:18:12</a>]  I was dreading taking econ but I was taking an econ at McCord Air Force they had this

[<a id="00-18-16">00:18:16</a>]  loophole where even if you're not a state resident if you take a class at the military

[<a id="00-18-21">00:18:21</a>]  base you're you're paid same price as a state resident so I went so that first year moving

[<a id="00-18-27">00:18:27</a>]  back to Washington State I went to Air Force and it was a great experience I was hanging

[<a id="00-18-32">00:18:32</a>]  out with military people that sometime one of my student friend stood in my class he

[<a id="00-18-37">00:18:37</a>]  disappeared for a week what wait what did you call it oh I was busy bombing Iraq so

[<a id="00-18-43">00:18:43</a>]  like it's people like that right and how much they hate Clinton and that's where I kind

[<a id="00-18-46">00:18:46</a>]  of put me a little bit on the path of conservatism but how old were you this time I was 20 21

[<a id="00-18-54">00:18:54</a>]  22 but the econ really changed because they had an impact in comedy because he gave this

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  example one time oh man I wish I could remember teacher because he had a really profound profound

[<a id="00-19-08">00:19:08</a>]  impact I mean he had an example like look let's say you're CEO of Chrysler and you find

[<a id="00-19-15">00:19:15</a>]  out one of the vehicle have a bad break now to recall it's gonna cost five billion dollars

[<a id="00-19-20">00:19:20</a>]  but if you pretend that there's nothing wrong and you pay lawsuit with a gun that you have

[<a id="00-19-25">00:19:25</a>]  to lawsuit with when people got killed it only cost a billion dollars so you have to

[<a id="00-19-30">00:19:30</a>]  make a decision what to do and I was like fuck I'm not saying shit you know and they

[<a id="00-19-36">00:19:36</a>]  did that actually with the Fort Pinto yeah so it's it's econ is not really like mathematical

[<a id="00-19-41">00:19:41</a>]  it is but at the end of the day it's a way of thinking and that had a huge influence

[<a id="00-19-46">00:19:46</a>]  because this is the same way when Breaking Bad if you think about it that show it's really

[<a id="00-19-50">00:19:50</a>]  about two things in my opinion vanity and neoliberal policies because it's one of those

[<a id="00-19-57">00:19:57</a>]  weird shows where a powerful man didn't care about getting sex it's a really unusual in

[<a id="00-20-02">00:20:02</a>]  that regard it's his wife have an extramarital affair but it's vanity and he rationalized

[<a id="00-20-07">00:20:07</a>]  everything right so I think the reason why sometimes people get mad at my jokes it's

[<a id="00-20-13">00:20:13</a>]  not that they're just mean and dark there is some dark twisted black logic to it if

[<a id="00-20-19">00:20:19</a>]  you really think about it that that's the kind of joke I like to write you know you

[<a id="00-20-24">00:20:24</a>]  know that joke I do a set of Texas training certain juvenile as a dope if they could commit

[<a id="00-20-32">00:20:32</a>]  a terrible crime so like well if you're going to commit if you if you're going to try her

[<a id="00-20-36">00:20:36</a>]  as an adult why am I getting trouble for fucking her but that was more like econ economic way

[<a id="00-20-41">00:20:41</a>]  of thinking like you know so I I remember any sort of like decency or humanity out of

[<a id="00-20-47">00:20:47</a>]  it but like I put myself in like how could I break this social situation reconstruct

[<a id="00-20-54">00:20:54</a>]  to make people uncomfortable in the audience yeah did you finish a degree in economics

[<a id="00-20-59">00:20:59</a>]  I mean I got a degree but they were they were getting mad I have I had occasion calling

[<a id="00-21-04">00:21:04</a>]  somebody a communist or two at school and you gotta remember I went to the every green

[<a id="00-21-09">00:21:09</a>]  state college where Eric Weinstein got in trouble because they had an event in my school

[<a id="00-21-14">00:21:14</a>]  this is years after I graduated a day without a white people and he said okay and he said

[<a id="00-21-20">00:21:20</a>]  this is racist which it is so he fought this school and they finally made a deal where

[<a id="00-21-28">00:21:28</a>]  he and his wife left but they got they were both tenured professors at that point yeah

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  they got like a million close a million dollars and Eric's oh no no that they're very Weinstein

[<a id="00-21-40">00:21:40</a>]  and they're older brothers Eric Weinstein who's been on a bunch of podcasts so he was

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  a professor at the school I went but there's a mob mentality at every green state college

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  it's like no in Olympia Washington in that state it's very notorious school different

[<a id="00-21-55">00:21:55</a>]  grades you could make any sort of degree and courses and then but to me I thought when

[<a id="00-22-03">00:22:03</a>]  I was listening to this kids like it's fucking they're communists the whole time I was there

[<a id="00-22-07">00:22:07</a>]  so that's where I wasn't even thinking about standing up like I would disagree with these

[<a id="00-22-10">00:22:10</a>]  people and they could say shit because I wasn't a white person and what were you what are

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  you thinking about doing with your life at this point did you have any yeah like inkling

[<a id="00-22-23">00:22:23</a>]  which direction you want to go no I mean looking back I wish I didn't go to college I think

[<a id="00-22-29">00:22:29</a>]  it was a waste of time for me but no no inkling at all because because when you know when

[<a id="00-22-35">00:22:35</a>]  things got bad around the highest I graduate 88 in the early 1990 I moved to Washington

[<a id="00-22-40">00:22:40</a>]  State distinct I just couldn't go to school and work at the same time I wasn't making

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  enough and the people that I'm living with it wasn't fair to them because I was I wasn't

[<a id="00-22-50">00:22:50</a>]  able to pay a lot for rental I moved out to Washington but until 90 to 90 late 91 I was

[<a id="00-22-59">00:22:59</a>]  just taking courses but I think going to military base and dealing with people with real problems

[<a id="00-23-05">00:23:05</a>]  that made me more inclined to be practical about things and when I went to every green

[<a id="00-23-10">00:23:10</a>]  where many of the professor like literally communist Marxist you know and that's notorious

[<a id="00-23-16">00:23:16</a>]  I mean all that right people in 1999 in Seattle WTO the one of the first riots I was there

[<a id="00-23-23">00:23:23</a>]  and many of the anarchists are like from every green and so many from Oregon there's so many

[<a id="00-23-32">00:23:32</a>]  anarchist shit in state of Oregon so don't be surprised I wasn't surprised not really

[<a id="00-23-38">00:23:38</a>]  when the censorship and where you can talk about things and as a comedy things got really

[<a id="00-23-43">00:23:43</a>]  really bad that part of the country which is bizarre because isn't that liberalism in

[<a id="00-23-49">00:23:49</a>]  the nutshell it's like free speech and all that sort of stuff yes but they got perverted

[<a id="00-23-54">00:23:54</a>]  I think I mean everybody's also famous famous miss Michael Richard went there and the guy

[<a id="00-23-58">00:23:58</a>]  who created Simpson went there Linda Barry not a funny cartoonist went there they were

[<a id="00-24-02">00:24:02</a>]  very very funny people but when my friend Tana Minou who is Brody Stevens best friend

[<a id="00-24-09">00:24:09</a>]  they used to have a public access show they were doing it way before Tom Green you know

[<a id="00-24-14">00:24:14</a>]  when we went up to WTO that was the beginning when I noticed something was not weird in

[<a id="00-24-19">00:24:19</a>]  the country you know holy shit can you imagine I've never seen anything like that where there's

[<a id="00-24-25">00:24:25</a>]  literally 40 to 50 60,000 angry people in downtown Seattle but they're angry for all

[<a id="00-24-30">00:24:30</a>]  kinds of different reasons like labor thing or environmental issues or register was a

[<a id="00-24-35">00:24:35</a>]  bunch of nuns for something and growth hormone and anti-pharmacy, anti-corporation and there

[<a id="00-24-41">00:24:41</a>]  are so many anarchists from Reed colleges where Steve Jobs went he didn't graduate but

[<a id="00-24-47">00:24:47</a>]  it's a very privileged elite liberal arts school a lot of the students have those ideas

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  you know and that was only 25 years ago but it's terrifying when you see a group of people

[<a id="00-25-00">00:25:00</a>]  that angry but you don't even know what like they're all they're all angry for different

[<a id="00-25-05">00:25:05</a>]  things but they become just like a monster you know you decided to go the other way though

[<a id="00-25-09">00:25:09</a>]  like as you were explaining just now like you saw that the college that you're going

[<a id="00-25-15">00:25:15</a>]  to has a certain leaning and you decided to go against the tide because I have sense of

[<a id="00-25-20">00:25:20</a>]  humor all right because people who deal in absolute they think they're perfect perfect

[<a id="00-25-30">00:25:30</a>]  people are not able to think they're imperfect the beauty of comedy right the beauty of comedy

[<a id="00-25-36">00:25:36</a>]  see something imperfect in something and you adore them for that babies are awkward they

[<a id="00-25-42">00:25:42</a>]  spit they're nagging they shit all the time they're just painted as but that's what make

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  them so lovable about them right right okay it's imperfect people pretending that perfect

[<a id="00-25-53">00:25:53</a>]  people i.e. Nazis if you look at it I mean look at all the members of Nazi parties not

[<a id="00-26-00">00:26:00</a>]  most of those leaders are not blonde and blue eyes none of them saw that irony of that you

[<a id="00-26-07">00:26:07</a>]  know yeah okay having a sense of humor now having a sense of humor and laughing it's

[<a id="00-26-14">00:26:14</a>]  not the same thing you know people murder people and thinking that's funny oh is that

[<a id="00-26-20">00:26:20</a>]  a problem yeah so when you're deciding to have that sense of humor like it is kind of

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  a decision because like the mold mentality to go against the grain yeah is that's a tough

[<a id="00-26-41">00:26:41</a>]  call like when you're poor only thing you have is laughter and resentment anger right but

[<a id="00-26-48">00:26:48</a>]  you you never saw it as an opportunity to be part of society you immediately decided

[<a id="00-26-55">00:26:55</a>]  like no fuck that noise I'm going against the grain here I didn't think there was an

[<a id="00-27-00">00:27:00</a>]  option that I didn't think there was an option not to be part of society I think you I mean

[<a id="00-27-06">00:27:06</a>]  okay within within four or five years I realized there was option but that's when I was looking

[<a id="00-27-13">00:27:13</a>]  at that penthouse magazine when they put uh Ted Kaczynski's um manifesto and I remember

[<a id="00-27-20">00:27:20</a>]  reading that it's like it's not cool what he did obviously but weirdly I think like

[<a id="00-27-29">00:27:29</a>]  a couple years ago I read some of that shit again I kind of met a lot of that stuff he

[<a id="00-27-34">00:27:34</a>]  kind of said it was right that not having connection with people environmental damage

[<a id="00-27-40">00:27:40</a>]  and how technology dehumanize people I mean do you think he's wrong no he's not wrong

[<a id="00-27-46">00:27:46</a>]  but his solution and diagnosis is wrong yes okay yeah because you know he liked the scale

[<a id="00-27-54">00:27:54</a>]  to really have an impact like if he'd been able to scale up his bombing campaign he could

[<a id="00-27-59">00:27:59</a>]  be uh here we go but mr january 6 over here so four years later so what so as some can

[<a id="00-28-07">00:28:07</a>]  but can I can I um but but take a sense is another example where um this is I don't know

[<a id="00-28-15">00:28:15</a>]  quite quantum uh clarify what I've been doing but um I don't know if you know this but um

[<a id="00-28-26">00:28:26</a>]  he had like a rash problem when he was a baby skin condition so they took the baby away

[<a id="00-28-30">00:28:30</a>]  for two weeks and they took the doctors in there said you got to be staying away from

[<a id="00-28-33">00:28:33</a>]  baby for infection but what happened was when he was away two weeks with very little uh

[<a id="00-28-39">00:28:39</a>]  human connection uh the family later realized it was a mistake it's they did something to

[<a id="00-28-43">00:28:43</a>]  him yeah and um and because of that he changed and he was an opera kid and also he was so

[<a id="00-28-52">00:28:52</a>]  intelligent that imagine was like in your 10 11 years old you're in high school uh no

[<a id="00-28-58">00:28:58</a>]  girls want to talk to you because you're so much younger so he's never learned to make

[<a id="00-29-04">00:29:04</a>]  connection with opposite sex and um there was a couple of times when he tried to date

[<a id="00-29-10">00:29:10</a>]  and it didn't work out um it got so bad that um he got fired from the job his younger brother

[<a id="00-29-18">00:29:18</a>]  was running because he was harassing one of the girls so he's never made a connection

[<a id="00-29-22">00:29:22</a>]  and also because he couldn't never learn connection with people he even thought about become transgender

[<a id="00-29-28">00:29:28</a>]  but he didn't have enough money to transition into that and finally when he went to harbor

[<a id="00-29-33">00:29:33</a>]  unfortunately the guy who was running um the department they're looking for very smart

[<a id="00-29-38">00:29:38</a>]  kids he is i think it's a former like oss which is it's a ci ice book yeah and uh the uh yeah

[<a id="00-29-50">00:29:50</a>]  they did the lst tests on him they did it this they did this um experiment on him and

[<a id="00-29-56">00:29:56</a>]  and what they do is they try to break him for four years right and uh this is something

[<a id="00-30-01">00:30:01</a>]  really interesting because they hit home with him is that um mk ultra i think that's a program

[<a id="00-30-06">00:30:06</a>]  they were doing harbor yes um david uh kaczynski his younger brother who would love his older

[<a id="00-30-16">00:30:16</a>]  brother very much he said when people are trying to break you one of the one of the

[<a id="00-30-22">00:30:22</a>]  worst things they break you but worst thing is uh when they don't break you something far

[<a id="00-30-28">00:30:28</a>]  worse happened which is you get hardened so when you torture people and when you have

[<a id="00-30-33">00:30:33</a>]  traumatic thing and you don't have a therapy and things like they they you you did something

[<a id="00-30-38">00:30:38</a>]  really tremendously terrible like every terrorist that u.s government's a terrorist and they're

[<a id="00-30-42">00:30:42</a>]  scumbag whatever but let me tell you yes i don't like those and they're scumbag the egyptian doctor

[<a id="00-30-48">00:30:48</a>]  that they torture who was number two by al qaeda man they did the fucking number and they got all

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  he wanted is death death american things like that we finally got him in afghanistan after um

[<a id="00-31-02">00:31:02</a>]  they lost that country but so this is the kind of thing i'm kind of you know i mean when when

[<a id="00-31-06">00:31:06</a>]  you torture people you dehumanize people rest assured you might destroy it maybe some of them

[<a id="00-31-12">00:31:12</a>]  die but but one that survived you're dealing some serious people yeah i mean i mean it shouldn't be

[<a id="00-31-18">00:31:18</a>]  that shouldn't actually be uh a surprise to anybody but but i mean it's a surprise to some

[<a id="00-31-26">00:31:26</a>]  u.s government people yeah they don't know what they're doing i mean i mean sometimes i think

[<a id="00-31-33">00:31:33</a>]  america is like the idiot kid on the world stage because because everything is in a narrow window

[<a id="00-31-40">00:31:40</a>]  of the current time without any thought about about what the historical context is but i mean

[<a id="00-31-46">00:31:46</a>]  the interesting thing is you're 100 right about that yeah if we go back to ted kaczynski yeah you

[<a id="00-31-52">00:31:52</a>]  have something in common with him is that you're also getting medical tested the whole time

[<a id="00-31-56">00:31:56</a>]  and are you still hoping that nkl true this is a bit of a stretch but well because i mean

[<a id="00-32-04">00:32:04</a>]  as elisa's i understood it he just thought i'd do this trial i i always stay away from any sort of

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  like um like a anything to do with your brain where it's um bipolar or schizophrenia things

[<a id="00-32-23">00:32:23</a>]  like that i don't mind altering stuff no i i've done like old-timers shit but uh i didn't i didn't

[<a id="00-32-31">00:32:31</a>]  want to do any of that um emotional kind of thing because even they tell you don't do that study

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  two times in a row yeah i did not recommend because they're just messing with the brain

[<a id="00-32-42">00:32:42</a>]  so but wait so you but i've been i've been to his home kaczynski and i've been to his library that

[<a id="00-32-48">00:32:48</a>]  he used to do research uh to make bombs and then i've been to most of the bus station that he went

[<a id="00-32-53">00:32:53</a>]  to uh when he left um montana lincoln montana because he will go a bunch of different um bus

[<a id="00-33-00">00:33:00</a>]  station and transfer another bus station and and because he made all his bomb litter from scratch

[<a id="00-33-06">00:33:06</a>]  they could never figure out where he's making the bomb where he's coming from from god and

[<a id="00-33-11">00:33:11</a>]  how was he caught always always it's a woman you know how he got caught right so david kaczynski's

[<a id="00-33-20">00:33:20</a>]  wife oh yeah um teddy got angry with his younger brother because once he got married he felt like

[<a id="00-33-30">00:33:30</a>]  he got rejected you know so he never talked to his younger brother ever again and uh his sister-in-law

[<a id="00-33-36">00:33:36</a>]  never met tay kaczynski but just like women have a king sense of smell what happened she was reading

[<a id="00-33-42">00:33:42</a>]  text letters and when she read the manifesto she noticed this certain language pattern that

[<a id="00-33-49">00:33:49</a>]  everyone had just like oh our fingerprints are unique she noticed something and she told her

[<a id="00-33-55">00:33:55</a>]  husband like i think this is dead and then the brother doesn't believe it so they went to some

[<a id="00-34-00">00:34:00</a>]  like uh writing analysis slash like the one of those fbi person that person said do you think

[<a id="00-34-08">00:34:08</a>]  this is like well i think there's a 20 chance it's it's possible so that's that's quite high

[<a id="00-34-14">00:34:14</a>]  yeah because most of them like i don't know how many hundreds of millions of people in America

[<a id="00-34-19">00:34:19</a>]  you know anyway that led to their arrest but it's interesting it was three women like the

[<a id="00-34-23">00:34:23</a>]  original investigator original fbi and there's like three women but they didn't really get a

[<a id="00-34-29">00:34:29</a>]  whole lot of credit for that magic creator but yeah but so so okay so you said four years you're

[<a id="00-34-34">00:34:34</a>]  reading was it in playboy or no in hustler it was in penthouse but they put it like uh i don't know

[<a id="00-34-41">00:34:41</a>]  like washington i know there are a bunch of different newspapers but penthouse also did that

[<a id="00-34-45">00:34:45</a>]  too so and what are you doing at this point around that time i was working for my mother's restaurant

[<a id="00-34-52">00:34:52</a>]  and my uncle's law firm and i was delivering um legal papers during the day what like subpoenas

[<a id="00-35-01">00:35:01</a>]  or divorce which was dangerous sometimes because i don't like i go to like uh oh you because you

[<a id="00-35-07">00:35:07</a>]  have that weird all in the states where you have to serve people right yeah yeah you hi i'm from

[<a id="00-35-12">00:35:12</a>]  fedex you've been served i think i'm really mad at you or i got chased by dogs and shit you know

[<a id="00-35-17">00:35:17</a>]  black neighborhood and uh i have to climb a fence and stuff like that i don't know i got i got x amount

[<a id="00-35-22">00:35:22</a>]  of money for like each serve or whatever but no it got scared a couple times i had a guy pulled a

[<a id="00-35-27">00:35:27</a>]  gun at me so uh yeah that's it's a job and a half but did that like i'm still fascinated by

[<a id="00-35-38">00:35:38</a>]  the fact that you saw what was going on in the college and you decided to go no i mean i wasn't

[<a id="00-35-45">00:35:45</a>]  like a why i just know that these people are not funny this is oh yeah they're just not that that

[<a id="00-35-50">00:35:50</a>]  was driving your decision was like all right this is not funny at all and this is back in 91 this is

[<a id="00-35-56">00:35:56</a>]  like i mean this is pre pre-woke i mean if you think it's not that i reject them they reject me

[<a id="00-36-02">00:36:02</a>]  because i'm a little too jokey and they hear that because you're not taking life serious is that what

[<a id="00-36-08">00:36:08</a>]  it is it's not it's more than these people take life too seriously like a religion or something

[<a id="00-36-16">00:36:16</a>]  because i remember the 85 86 and 87 like all the smart kids because i couldn't hang out with job

[<a id="00-36-21">00:36:21</a>]  even though i i was kind of making people laugh they thought i was a funny kid like not a hilarious

[<a id="00-36-29">00:36:29</a>]  kid but funny enough like i'll see it's like called an odd thing to make people laugh i ask

[<a id="00-36-33">00:36:33</a>]  stupid questions during the class or um you kind of sit up certain chess piece i say something instead

[<a id="00-36-41">00:36:41</a>]  of the teacher saying i already had it like that i didn't realize it was a punchline whatever but

[<a id="00-36-45">00:36:45</a>]  like you know and i pretend like oh sorry i'm in english my second night i was in that that kind of

[<a id="00-36-50">00:36:50</a>]  shit but i just didn't get along with people with no sense of humor because i was not a very social

[<a id="00-36-56">00:36:56</a>]  personal likable but because there's this theory that what happened in the american universities i

[<a id="00-37-03">00:37:03</a>]  don't know which ones is that it was basically a wave of uh kind of a political agenda we had this

[<a id="00-37-10">00:37:10</a>]  one this one lady that both of us know who is on another podcast we used to do and she was a product

[<a id="00-37-18">00:37:18</a>]  of that and it was she's younger uh she was what 28 so this is like a whole one or almost two

[<a id="00-37-26">00:37:26</a>]  generations of yeah of this going through universities yeah and oh boy was she it was

[<a id="00-37-34">00:37:34</a>]  it was fanaticism like there are certain topics you bring them up it's like yeah and and and to me

[<a id="00-37-42">00:37:42</a>]  that's like seeing that microcosm of that it's like this fanaticism where there's no rational

[<a id="00-37-49">00:37:49</a>]  discussion yeah there's no like hold on a second that doesn't sound like very smart you know when

[<a id="00-37-56">00:37:56</a>]  you watch i'm sure you guys will watch breaking bad right yeah yeah so that two different

[<a id="00-38-00">00:38:00</a>]  experiences if you're one of those who watch from beginning like one season at a time then you you

[<a id="00-38-04">00:38:04</a>]  know the gradual change of water white but when you binge it it's clear like how bad he became

[<a id="00-38-10">00:38:10</a>]  right away so when i was in college like i knew something was weird but once you graduate you don't

[<a id="00-38-15">00:38:15</a>]  really pay attention but every once in a while when i when we committed to shows at like comedy

[<a id="00-38-20">00:38:20</a>]  college campuses like you know i did notice like whoa what's what's that that's really weird like

[<a id="00-38-28">00:38:28</a>]  i've done shows in university washington they were not like this like uh like in the 90s like

[<a id="00-38-33">00:38:33</a>]  90s but then i don't know 2010 or something like what the fuck you know yeah yeah so but there's

[<a id="00-38-42">00:38:42</a>]  plenty of smart people are saying like for a long time any protest from uh college campuses were

[<a id="00-38-47">00:38:47</a>]  initiated by professors that's not the case anymore it's the students who don't really know

[<a id="00-38-52">00:38:52</a>]  what they're talking about yeah it's uh lord of the flies it's kind of like kids running things

[<a id="00-38-59">00:38:59</a>]  you know exactly yeah that's it i said to my my kids there's nothing worse than a young person

[<a id="00-39-06">00:39:06</a>]  that's trying to change the world it's really it is actually it's terrifying and that's not me just

[<a id="00-39-12">00:39:12</a>]  being an old man is because it's because i see how little they know but they get an opinion

[<a id="00-39-18">00:39:18</a>]  and then and they're off of it and it's just like i want to change the world yeah maybe

[<a id="00-39-23">00:39:23</a>]  maybe tidy your room first yeah you can tidy your room consistently for a week then we can talk about

[<a id="00-39-29">00:39:29</a>]  the next stage of your competence owning a plant is it is it like yeah is your rule basically like

[<a id="00-39-36">00:39:36</a>]  the a a thing um where you know like people that go through withdrawal or whatever it's like first

[<a id="00-39-42">00:39:42</a>]  you have to take care of the house then you can take care of a plant then you might be able to

[<a id="00-39-46">00:39:46</a>]  get a dog yeah because because the thing is otherwise you're just an idiot with an ideology

[<a id="00-39-50">00:39:50</a>]  that you're well said everyone's yeah no you're right yeah okay because they could change the

[<a id="00-39-58">00:39:58</a>]  world for worse enough or better exactly there's it's only going to get worse because anything you

[<a id="00-40-03">00:40:03</a>]  change in an ecosystem of all kinds of different things the only radical change i don't know which

[<a id="00-40-10">00:40:10</a>]  direction is i went to bloddy mayor lennon's place yeah and and there was a guy named something grim

[<a id="00-40-17">00:40:17</a>]  sorry comrade lennon yeah comrade lennon and comrade grim who was swiss wouldn't allow him to

[<a id="00-40-22">00:40:22</a>]  take control of the local communist party so he was really frustrated until revolution fighting

[<a id="00-40-28">00:40:28</a>]  went and and then they went inside of uh uh communism so he went back to russia like the way

[<a id="00-40-35">00:40:35</a>]  ayatollah khomeini returned in 79 iran you know and uh you have to have idea but also stupid people

[<a id="00-40-42">00:40:42</a>]  enough to follow you you know you need a mob but and the more i hate the mob the the mob is basically

[<a id="00-40-48">00:40:48</a>]  built by ideology i guess so yeah and what you're saying is it's like ideology is easier consumed

[<a id="00-40-57">00:40:57</a>]  by young minds in that case i think it's a it's a two it it's a two the ideology is one part the

[<a id="00-41-04">00:41:04</a>]  other part is fear it's it's fear of what if you're in the group then the fear of of of the group rejecting

[<a id="00-41-13">00:41:13</a>]  it gets maximized and i mean for a lot of a lot of people like like i remember ben went to see

[<a id="00-41-19">00:41:19</a>]  one of your son okay my son uh climate rallies and because gretta toomba was in town and and

[<a id="00-41-25">00:41:25</a>]  he no no no but he went there with his buddy because they're like there's going to be i'm not

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  talking about him i'm talking about her oh yeah but there's going to be hot young chicks that was

[<a id="00-41-35">00:41:35</a>]  his okay he's really smart yeah wait wait but can i tell you something uh continue but when he comes

[<a id="00-41-41">00:41:41</a>]  back slightly radicalized yes what another thing that really changed my uh opinion about the whole

[<a id="00-41-47">00:41:47</a>]  thing at the net seattle 1999 seattle wto there's about 50 000 uh people who care about the world

[<a id="00-41-53">00:41:53</a>]  they had all different reasons not one hot chair so so so you know what i mean when you're beautiful

[<a id="00-42-03">00:42:03</a>]  women the world come to you when you're ugly you have to care about the world you understand yeah

[<a id="00-42-07">00:42:07</a>]  and have you noticed having why is it every time these hollywood stars who are superstars when

[<a id="00-42-17">00:42:17</a>]  you're young and once they get old and they can't get any work all of a sudden they care about the

[<a id="00-42-21">00:42:21</a>]  planet and they want to do all kinds of shit about you know it's because it's a nice way to get

[<a id="00-42-26">00:42:26</a>]  attention you know but when you're super hot you don't have to give a fuck about you are the world

[<a id="00-42-30">00:42:30</a>]  they will come to you yeah you're like the black american express unlimited uh uh you could charge

[<a id="00-42-36">00:42:36</a>]  as much when you're that beautiful you you don't like you you understand you guys are white guys

[<a id="00-42-42">00:42:42</a>]  you understand this better than i do the power of beautiful white women look at look at uh homers

[<a id="00-42-49">00:42:49</a>]  elliott they went fucking war over one chick yeah yeah and and women white women know the value

[<a id="00-42-56">00:42:56</a>]  of their beauty they only take them one accusation you have emma tilka was murdered

[<a id="00-43-02">00:43:02</a>]  or tosa wall street because some white women supposedly said some black kid running the

[<a id="00-43-09">00:43:09</a>]  elevator with this grabbed her ass or something all you have to do you in the west the white women

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  so value their dissatisfaction have to correct it right away they have that kind of privilege so a

[<a id="00-43-22">00:43:22</a>]  lot of time when you go this route rallies and stuff it's like young privileged white women are

[<a id="00-43-27">00:43:27</a>]  used to being heard and taken seriously even the ugly one think they're privileged you know but

[<a id="00-43-32">00:43:32</a>]  when the white women cry they're the most dangerous animal absolutely because when the

[<a id="00-43-38">00:43:38</a>]  black women or latino women or asian women cry men asian women cry nobody give a fuck

[<a id="00-43-44">00:43:44</a>]  but pretty white women crying especially oh forget about due process yeah her grievance

[<a id="00-43-51">00:43:51</a>]  have to be corrected and use whatever being necessary that's why bill burr was so great

[<a id="00-43-57">00:43:57</a>]  when he went on the snail and then talk about that shit about oh why women you weren't part

[<a id="00-44-01">00:44:01</a>]  of the problem yeah it's nice to know you're not part of the problem you know what i mean but

[<a id="00-44-06">00:44:06</a>]  that's why beautiful women i call them hot h-o-t helen of troy because they went fucking wall for

[<a id="00-44-17">00:44:17</a>]  that fucking bitch the whole time we're really like i know why women are pretty black you guys

[<a id="00-44-21">00:44:21</a>]  are going fucking war for this bitch yeah and they make any sense to me like i'm ever since

[<a id="00-44-26">00:44:26</a>]  a pretty girls but like a war 10 years lives are destroyed families destroyed went over on one

[<a id="00-44-33">00:44:33</a>]  fucking white bitch so when you go to college campuses and when these when these young girls

[<a id="00-44-39">00:44:39</a>]  went like super well yeah education they're talking all this stuff at the end of the day

[<a id="00-44-44">00:44:44</a>]  one thing i have to say are they able to take jokes they are not funny people they're not funny

[<a id="00-44-49">00:44:49</a>]  people man there were actually a couple of things that weren't good not to give away a

[<a id="00-44-54">00:44:54</a>]  punchline but there's this beautiful bit about accidentally ending up in the women's rally and how and how he appreciates that they're showing their boobs but

[<a id="00-45-05">00:45:05</a>]  they're not the boobs that he wants to see they're not there no but the other thing if me this is my

[<a id="00-45-11">00:45:11</a>]  little thing is is uh there's follow the money and also follow follow the parents and if you

[<a id="00-45-19">00:45:19</a>]  look up who greta well said greta toonberg's parents are that she's a plant she's a political

[<a id="00-45-26">00:45:26</a>]  instrument like the mom is their parents are like they're a drama queen the theater moms yeah the

[<a id="00-45-32">00:45:32</a>]  mom is a the mom was an opera singer i think and the dad's a lawyer and their connections go all

[<a id="00-45-37">00:45:37</a>]  the way to the world economic forum it's a hundred percent it's a it's a it's it's a fucking construct

[<a id="00-45-44">00:45:44</a>]  made made it makes you bad just criticizing a kid she's got a big fucking mouth i'm not saying she's

[<a id="00-45-50">00:45:50</a>]  wrong but you can't criticize her when she's saying all kinds of stuff there's this comedian he has a

[<a id="00-45-54">00:45:54</a>]  bit about her on the comedy and he just calls her greta toon bot and it's it's just and he just says

[<a id="00-46-00">00:46:00</a>]  this phenomenal impression yeah but yeah i mean yeah i'm not an environmental guy because if you've

[<a id="00-46-07">00:46:07</a>]  learned to me you spot the choice between starving family needs to work at coal mining and cutting

[<a id="00-46-12">00:46:12</a>]  a tree and shit like that i'm on their fucking side but i think it's like the polar bear it's

[<a id="00-46-17">00:46:17</a>]  it's the thing is i think what we don't understand in the system yeah of how the world is run is this

[<a id="00-46-23">00:46:23</a>]  there's genuine problems with the environment and then there's this system of divide and rule

[<a id="00-46-29">00:46:29</a>]  which is what the british salary around india comes goes back to the romans and it's simply

[<a id="00-46-34">00:46:34</a>]  it's a very simple principle just make two groups of people to fight each other and you don't care

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  it doesn't matter to you you've got like the pro environment and the anti-environment if

[<a id="00-46-46">00:46:46</a>]  you get the shit they're fighting so you can run the shit yeah um i'm not against environment per

[<a id="00-46-53">00:46:53</a>]  se i just don't like these uh privileged kids who never have to suffer those day of going hungry

[<a id="00-46-59">00:46:59</a>]  telling people who need those jobs desperately like what they're doing selfish who's selfish

[<a id="00-47-04">00:47:04</a>]  yeah privileged people telling those poor people a lot of that privileged people privileged because

[<a id="00-47-09">00:47:09</a>]  they cause all kinds of problems in the world to begin with and they benefit from that yeah so i

[<a id="00-47-13">00:47:13</a>]  just want to punch those people in the face both men and women you know but there is much i sense

[<a id="00-47-19">00:47:19</a>]  much violence yes that's why i like thomas saul he said there's no solutions there's trade-off

[<a id="00-47-26">00:47:26</a>]  everyone have to make tough decision like what's fair equitable and tough decision where and like

[<a id="00-47-32">00:47:32</a>]  i usually like solutions where both side hate it that's usually the probably the best solution yeah

[<a id="00-47-37">00:47:37</a>]  because not once you know that famous negotiation one-on-one where two kids are finding a piece of

[<a id="00-47-42">00:47:42</a>]  pie so what you do is the first kid to cut it and the second one had the first choice what side

[<a id="00-47-47">00:47:47</a>]  well of course the one cutting is going to cut it evenly so of course life is not that simple but i

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  just think thomas saul's right it's it's about trade-off and everybody have to make painful

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  sacrifice yeah it's like they say like sorry from king solomon where they're arguing over a baby

[<a id="00-48-05">00:48:05</a>]  yeah and then he says well i'm gonna fuck this child unless you sort it out and i think that's

[<a id="00-48-10">00:48:10</a>]  something that i don't know what he said i mean with a knife like i think the situation was they're

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  trying to figure out who is the true mother and the fake ones say well we could cut it in half

[<a id="00-48-22">00:48:22</a>]  they will have a happy because she's a bitter person and another person say no no no you keep

[<a id="00-48-26">00:48:26</a>]  it don't don't hurt the baby that's the real mom yeah it's very different from what you just said

[<a id="00-48-35">00:48:35</a>]  a little timeout okay or what do you think well how long was that it's 47 minutes oh 47

[<a id="00-48-41">00:48:41</a>]  actually that was kind of fun fun episode okay because i was bashing light women for once all

[<a id="00-48-47">00:48:47</a>]  right there's one thing i want to understand because i know that this is part of part of

[<a id="00-48-52">00:48:52</a>]  what you've done how where did we get from you so you're how did he end up working in a in a porn

[<a id="00-48-58">00:48:58</a>]  show like like what am i at that time no no it was late 90s um so there's a there's a descent of

[<a id="00-49-08">00:49:08</a>]  yoshi into porn um my my mother wasn't paying me any money i don't know when i was working

[<a id="00-49-15">00:49:15</a>]  for her at the restaurant so i saved a bunch of tips and i turned around put those tip money to

[<a id="00-49-21">00:49:21</a>]  one of those um global index fund for a little bit so i went from a couple hundred a couple

[<a id="00-49-27">00:49:27</a>]  thousand like maybe seven eight thousand within a year then i turned around put a down payment on

[<a id="00-49-32">00:49:32</a>]  the house so i bought a house in 1995 can you believe it for real yeah about a house i'm not

[<a id="00-49-39">00:49:39</a>]  a complete idiot so i bought a house and i was renting one of the room whatever so i had about

[<a id="00-49-45">00:49:45</a>]  a comedian and that's that had uh and this is also you have you're not doing comedy at this point

[<a id="00-49-52">00:49:52</a>]  96 well i meant 90s okay i mean i was doing it because i i actually i was doing toast master

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  rephrase that i was doing toast master oh gross that's what i was doing i got in trouble because

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  they got upset every time i was talking about stuff that they don't want to hear you know so

[<a id="00-50-09">00:50:09</a>]  your comedy career began with toast masters i was actually doing more speeches actually okay

[<a id="00-50-14">00:50:14</a>]  but i enjoy i just pretend like oh i'm so sorry i didn't mean it i did mean it i just want to

[<a id="00-50-20">00:50:20</a>]  ruin everybody can you can you explain toast masters to me i still don't understand toast

[<a id="00-50-24">00:50:24</a>]  masters it's one of those or it's one of the organizations to help you public speaking

[<a id="00-50-28">00:50:28</a>]  so there's a club all over there's chapters all over the world there's literally there's

[<a id="00-50-32">00:50:32</a>]  literally toast master in zurich somewhere yeah yeah yeah that some of the most annoying

[<a id="00-50-37">00:50:37</a>]  comedians i've encountered over the last few years there were people who were doing toast masters

[<a id="00-50-42">00:50:42</a>]  sorry toast masters people you know who you are but it but it because what i get from talking to

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  them they're taught a formula of yeah the first one's like tell us about yourself you're the first

[<a id="00-50-54">00:50:54</a>]  speech about yourself you know and it's fucking tragically boring the way they communicate it

[<a id="00-51-00">00:51:00</a>]  just makes you want to punch yourself it's like it's like verbal powerpoint but there but there's

[<a id="00-51-06">00:51:06</a>]  there's a banish sometime with toast master because if you're taking the toast master in

[<a id="00-51-10">00:51:10</a>]  like late night in early 2000 in uh hollywood studios they had those that was a really good

[<a id="00-51-15">00:51:15</a>]  way if you want to make show business i didn't know about until later one you know like steven

[<a id="00-51-19">00:51:19</a>]  spellberg famously when he was a kid he's sneaking into a university studio one of mg a paramount

[<a id="00-51-25">00:51:25</a>]  studio whatever every day sneak in he was just like stunning what's going on there eventually a

[<a id="00-51-30">00:51:30</a>]  couple months later he got caught and whoever was higher up was so impressed he they gave him a job

[<a id="00-51-35">00:51:35</a>]  there so did so you know i did the same thing you want to learn more about porn just work a porn

[<a id="00-51-40">00:51:40</a>]  shop and i'll end up working for evil angel things like that you know what is it 80 90 success in

[<a id="00-51-45">00:51:45</a>]  life is just showing up winning allen famously said so but so okay so you don't tell us masters

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  you buy a house of some comedians when you sublet and buy coins since you end up with comedians or

[<a id="00-51-57">00:51:57</a>]  yeah and like how dysfunctional they were and um try trashing your new house but one thing i learned

[<a id="00-52-06">00:52:06</a>]  from one of my friend he was saying how much money to contract for megan i just couldn't believe

[<a id="00-52-11">00:52:11</a>]  the amount they were making so he finally brought me financial report like 96 or 7 i thought oh man

[<a id="00-52-18">00:52:18</a>]  oh yeah so like oh that's that seemed like a profitable business and then my cousin invited me

[<a id="00-52-26">00:52:26</a>]  1999 to hawaii he brought his company over there i hate to say it but my cousin's like a

[<a id="00-52-35">00:52:35</a>]  semi-mob guy and the people that were working for him like that bill collector bill clicker

[<a id="00-52-42">00:52:42</a>]  but i remembered like they were using a lot of fists to like collect money or what that

[<a id="00-52-46">00:52:46</a>]  so they were in hawaii i was hanging out with them he asked me if i give you a hundred thousand

[<a id="00-52-51">00:52:51</a>]  dollars could you start a business and so that kind of put a seed in my head like oh

[<a id="00-52-55">00:52:55</a>]  what can we do there when my friend tana brody stephens the best friend said

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  look how much money was making so that so he and i we were starting thinking like maybe we should

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  open a store in seattle area and january 1999 i went to vegas for the first time i went to the

[<a id="00-53-21">00:53:21</a>]  porn convention for the first time and when i met john steliano my future boss and former boss now

[<a id="00-53-30">00:53:30</a>]  at evil angel aka buttman changed my life because out of all the porn well first of all i picked

[<a id="00-53-36">00:53:36</a>]  buttman movies because i'm a fan of batman and his logo is like ass like a batman shape so like

[<a id="00-53-44">00:53:44</a>]  what's that like so like oh that's buttman so i started that's how i got into like batman and

[<a id="00-53-48">00:53:48</a>]  buttman i went i went to that and i started looking at stuff and i started like watching

[<a id="00-53-53">00:53:53</a>]  these movies they're great but it was like philosophy behind this company was so different

[<a id="00-53-58">00:53:58</a>]  from other um porn company that when you're a director for evil angel you own your product

[<a id="00-54-04">00:54:04</a>]  because he he was a huge free market guy so that gave incentive for you to work really hard and he

[<a id="00-54-10">00:54:10</a>]  was making tons of money like a franchise almost yeah and and he donated money to kato institute

[<a id="00-54-16">00:54:16</a>]  which is uh started by the coke brothers in wichita kansas uh liberal people hates him but

[<a id="00-54-22">00:54:22</a>]  it was started by them and he donated money to american enterprise and uh reason magazine

[<a id="00-54-28">00:54:28</a>]  things like that so i thought okay he's a pornographer but he's interested in so many

[<a id="00-54-32">00:54:32</a>]  different kind of things i thought what an interesting guy you know were you already

[<a id="00-54-35">00:54:35</a>]  conservative at that point or was that some somewhat informing your conservatism i don't

[<a id="00-54-42">00:54:42</a>]  that's a really i don't know how to answer that because i'm not i like history

[<a id="00-54-50">00:54:50</a>]  so i did learn that human nature's been saying no matter how many however many thousands years ago

[<a id="00-54-56">00:54:56</a>]  you go back you can learn a lot from history so that's a conservative thing but i'm not

[<a id="00-55-02">00:55:02</a>]  socially conservative i mean i like pornography i'm all for legalizing drugs i'm also okay with

[<a id="00-55-08">00:55:08</a>]  transgender you want to have a fantasy pretending like you're a man but one man whatever that that's

[<a id="00-55-13">00:55:13</a>]  not my business you're gay so it's more libertarian i didn't care about that yes i i guess domestically

[<a id="00-55-20">00:55:20</a>]  i'm libertarian but um when it comes to foreign policy um i mean i met ender kessinger oh wow

[<a id="00-55-32">00:55:32</a>]  so i'm uh i believe in pragmatic foreign policy so i was a big fan of nixon oh yeah i have a lot

[<a id="00-55-40">00:55:40</a>]  of weird shit pragmatic foreign policy aka napalm how did you meet kissinger um i met kissinger

[<a id="00-55-47">00:55:47</a>]  because one time he was speaking at nixon library so i saw him twice but the first time i sneaked

[<a id="00-55-53">00:55:53</a>]  in the once again i sneaked in the line asked him a question that's the theme of sneaky guy

[<a id="00-55-58">00:55:58</a>]  okay cool you ask him a question yeah so everybody asked a lot of funny questions

[<a id="00-56-04">00:56:04</a>]  my question i forgot the guy's name there was a guy from i think montana

[<a id="00-56-10">00:56:10</a>]  early to mid-60s he walked from 38th barrel from an american military post went to north korea

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  he got captured and then after that he was forced to stay in north korea and become a movie star

[<a id="00-56-23">00:56:23</a>]  because every time daniel evo american actor he's in uh he played that character in movies so he was

[<a id="00-56-28">00:56:28</a>]  kind of famous movie star in north korea and he was forced to marry a japanese national who were

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  kidnapped by the north korean spies so there was probably like a dozen of them so here's two people

[<a id="00-56-39">00:56:39</a>]  american and japanese who hate on screen government because he realized how it's not as he believed

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  the propaganda is not true so i asked dr hendrick kissinger i read a couple of his books dr kissinger

[<a id="00-56-52">00:56:52</a>]  what do you think should happen to him and my second question is uh well the new york yankees

[<a id="00-56-58">00:56:58</a>]  win the world series and got huge laugh it's in c-span someplace you know may may may he was he

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  had a big smile on his face so he's so kind of first of all you know that guy who crossed the

[<a id="00-57-09">00:57:09</a>]  border um i was kind of shocked by this he should be court-martialed and punished to full extent of

[<a id="00-57-15">00:57:15</a>]  punishment and served many years in prison i was like my my every day was like dude he lived in

[<a id="00-57-22">00:57:22</a>]  north korea for 40 years how much more you want to punish your guy you know yeah but to kissinger

[<a id="00-57-29">00:57:29</a>]  had a big smile and say you know in case they need pictures you know like because he was really happy

[<a id="00-57-34">00:57:34</a>]  because he could always get asked um foreign policy questions yeah it's always the always

[<a id="00-57-40">00:57:40</a>]  nice to ask famous people some questions they're not used to get asked and it's not personal

[<a id="00-57-44">00:57:44</a>]  question yeah that they wanted to talk they want to show the world like they have other interests

[<a id="00-57-49">00:57:49</a>]  yeah and kind of it kind of makes them when you when you do that so you need to do a little bit

[<a id="00-57-53">00:57:53</a>]  of basic research about people right even back when i was young i kind of knew that sort of thing

[<a id="00-57-59">00:57:59</a>]  so then whenever i had i had a chance to meet somebody famous just do some basic homework

[<a id="00-58-03">00:58:03</a>]  you know and what did you what was your he laughed by the way he liked that conversation but i mean

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  what was your read on kissinger like you saw him there in person like what what is your anything

[<a id="00-58-18">00:58:18</a>]  that sticks in your head about like how he was or who he was as much as i like as much as i love

[<a id="00-58-24">00:58:24</a>]  christopher hitchens i love i love dr kissinger uh there's many things that he did world crimes

[<a id="00-58-30">00:58:30</a>]  crimes and uh you know i'm not gonna make comments on that but uh and i'm not gonna

[<a id="00-58-35">00:58:35</a>]  have an argument with them but i do think what he did make this fucking move on russia and chinese

[<a id="00-58-44">00:58:44</a>]  i think is incredible i think they inverted uh world war three you know and i think whenever

[<a id="00-58-51">00:58:51</a>]  they say they like okay so this we're gonna finish by going circle back it's kind of perfect now

[<a id="00-58-56">00:58:56</a>]  all these uh young people white women saying you're a horror criminal baby killers whatever

[<a id="00-59-02">00:59:02</a>]  it's easy for for them to say that because they're never going to be in position of horror and they

[<a id="00-59-07">00:59:07</a>]  will never know what is to be in dealing with this complicated life and death life and death of

[<a id="00-59-13">00:59:13</a>]  millions of people so it's a complicated three you know like a like massive rubik's cube because if
