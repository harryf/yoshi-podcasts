[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  I'm not saying be rude to women, but I think, uh, I don't know why you can't call a woman

[<a id="00-00-06">00:00:06</a>]  a dumb bitch when they're acting like a dumb bitch, you know?

[<a id="00-00-09">00:00:09</a>]  And these young guys, it's so terrible these days, like, who was I talking to yesterday?

[<a id="00-00-17">00:00:17</a>]  Somebody was telling me they're so afraid to make an initial move.

[<a id="00-00-21">00:00:21</a>]  Oh, my friend in Amsterdam, she's Greek, she said like, I just don't, she just hate the

[<a id="00-00-28">00:00:28</a>]  soy men.

[<a id="00-00-30">00:00:30</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-00-31">00:00:31</a>]  Women fucking hate it, which is why, like, for me in this city, I'm basically something

[<a id="00-00-36">00:00:36</a>]  like an alpha male, which is ridiculous.

[<a id="00-00-39">00:00:39</a>]  Like, I don't have the body, I'm old, but the thing is because I'm willing to be, to

[<a id="00-00-44">00:00:44</a>]  make it, be a dirtbag in a relationship.

[<a id="00-00-48">00:00:48</a>]  I'm not saying be a dirtbag either.

[<a id="00-00-50">00:00:50</a>]  No, no, I don't mean an asshole, I mean it's like, is to make the conversation sexual and

[<a id="00-00-57">00:00:57</a>]  see if she's into it, you know, you know what's interesting?

[<a id="00-00-59">00:00:59</a>]  I could be wrong about this, but, um, are you already recording?

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  You got everything, it's all switched on.

[<a id="00-01-08">00:01:08</a>]  Wait, are you already, are you already recording?

[<a id="00-01-12">00:01:12</a>]  I am.

[<a id="00-01-13">00:01:13</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-01-14">00:01:14</a>]  Um, wait, why does, why does the audio sound so weird or I'm not hearing it as well as

[<a id="00-01-19">00:01:19</a>]  yesterday.

[<a id="00-01-20">00:01:20</a>]  One, two, one, two.

[<a id="00-01-21">00:01:21</a>]  Oh yeah.

[<a id="00-01-22">00:01:22</a>]  There you go.

[<a id="00-01-23">00:01:23</a>]  One, two.

[<a id="00-01-24">00:01:24</a>]  No, it's just you.

[<a id="00-01-25">00:01:25</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-26">00:01:26</a>]  It's cause you're wearing, it's cause you're wearing the jacket.

[<a id="00-01-28">00:01:28</a>]  It's, it's your jacket is muffling your voice.

[<a id="00-01-31">00:01:31</a>]  Oh, is that right?

[<a id="00-01-32">00:01:32</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-01-33">00:01:33</a>]  Um, I, I took a couple of those electronics class.

[<a id="00-01-46">00:01:46</a>]  I had to take one of those vocational stuff in high college, high school and they were

[<a id="00-01-51">00:01:51</a>]  saying that people get killed at the middle range shock too low or too high.

[<a id="00-02-00">00:02:00</a>]  It doesn't kill you.

[<a id="00-02-01">00:02:01</a>]  That's the funny thing that this, this middle middleness, like lukewarm thing.

[<a id="00-02-08">00:02:08</a>]  And that's the thing like, um, wait, are you talking about being electrocuted?

[<a id="00-02-13">00:02:13</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-02-14">00:02:14</a>]  I think it's kind of same thing with why women hate that kind of wishy washy kind of middle

[<a id="00-02-17">00:02:17</a>]  of the road bullshit.

[<a id="00-02-18">00:02:18</a>]  You know?

[<a id="00-02-19">00:02:19</a>]  I'm not saying I was wondering where this is going.

[<a id="00-02-23">00:02:23</a>]  No, I'm not saying punch the bitch in the face.

[<a id="00-02-25">00:02:25</a>]  I'm not saying that I'm not saying that, but you're right.

[<a id="00-02-29">00:02:29</a>]  Cause it's the middle ones are the ones that are going to end up doing some nasty shit.

[<a id="00-02-33">00:02:33</a>]  The actual like, yeah, I don't, I don't know what's going on because I think I keep hearing

[<a id="00-02-40">00:02:40</a>]  the same shit over and over, you know, and, uh, I haven't been in church for a while and

[<a id="00-02-45">00:02:45</a>]  this is by far the best Sunday morning sermon I've heard in a long time.

[<a id="00-02-49">00:02:49</a>]  Don't punch her in the face.

[<a id="00-02-53">00:02:53</a>]  I don't like when that, when I, uh, these, uh, young kids saying like, you can't be nice

[<a id="00-02-57">00:02:57</a>]  to girls.

[<a id="00-02-58">00:02:58</a>]  They don't like that.

[<a id="00-02-59">00:02:59</a>]  No, that I don't, I don't believe that either, but, um, no, it's a, it's a certain, it's

[<a id="00-03-06">00:03:06</a>]  a certain frame of way where you're like, yeah, I will, you know, bend you over my sofa

[<a id="00-03-12">00:03:12</a>]  and fuck you hard, but also I'm in control of myself and I'm going to treat you respectfully.

[<a id="00-03-17">00:03:17</a>]  So it's like, it's like that and, and that's what they, yeah, it's just like fucking everybody's

[<a id="00-03-24">00:03:24</a>]  human.

[<a id="00-03-25">00:03:25</a>]  Everyone wants to fuck, but women and men have, but do they really?

[<a id="00-03-29">00:03:29</a>]  Yeah, of course.

[<a id="00-03-31">00:03:31</a>]  But it's, it's a famous Patrice O'Neill.

[<a id="00-03-33">00:03:33</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-03-34">00:03:34</a>]  But I'm just saying even Patrice didn't live long enough to see what's been going on last

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  10, 12 years with technology.

[<a id="00-03-40">00:03:40</a>]  Oh yeah.

[<a id="00-03-41">00:03:41</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-03-42">00:03:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  More people live in the virtual world.

[<a id="00-03-44">00:03:44</a>]  You know what are you saying?

[<a id="00-03-46">00:03:46</a>]  Do you, do you reckon sex is going to fully virtualize eventually?

[<a id="00-03-50">00:03:50</a>]  I mean Irish Affair was making fun of me one time about how sexless lives, Asian men, particularly

[<a id="00-03-58">00:03:58</a>]  like Korean and Japanese men.

[<a id="00-04-01">00:04:01</a>]  And I feel like the reason why you think they don't have a lot of sex because you don't

[<a id="00-04-05">00:04:05</a>]  take account of all the rapes are going on in Japan.

[<a id="00-04-10">00:04:10</a>]  I'm kidding, but it's, I don't know, it's, it, it, um, something weird is going on with

[<a id="00-04-18">00:04:18</a>]  that though.

[<a id="00-04-19">00:04:19</a>]  That's for sure.

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  And I mean, it's something I think too much about, but it's also with my son.

[<a id="00-04-25">00:04:25</a>]  I think one thing is it is cause he's had a dad and, and, and I've, I've had to navigate

[<a id="00-04-32">00:04:32</a>]  that with him.

[<a id="00-04-33">00:04:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-04-34">00:04:34</a>]  Like this kind of, you've got to be, you've got to have some balls, but you've also not

[<a id="00-04-38">00:04:38</a>]  got to, you shouldn't be a dick like, and this is going to, you're going to turn this

[<a id="00-04-44">00:04:44</a>]  somewhere.

[<a id="00-04-45">00:04:45</a>]  But I say like, he's got an advantage as not only does he have a dad telling him this stuff

[<a id="00-04-50">00:04:50</a>]  in a certain way.

[<a id="00-04-51">00:04:51</a>]  I don't, I don't tell him too much, but he's also got an older sister.

[<a id="00-04-54">00:04:54</a>]  So he, he fundamentally knows instinctively he's had a, he's had like a data point.

[<a id="00-05-01">00:05:01</a>]  He's got his sister to tell him what, how women behave basically.

[<a id="00-05-06">00:05:06</a>]  And, and so he's, you know, he's 18 and he's, he's been killing it in a certain way.

[<a id="00-05-13">00:05:13</a>]  And he doesn't, he's not, he's not running around being horny the whole time and trying

[<a id="00-05-18">00:05:18</a>]  to sleep with everyone.

[<a id="00-05-20">00:05:20</a>]  He's actually very restrained about it.

[<a id="00-05-25">00:05:25</a>]  I don't know what it is like in, in, in Europe, but you know, the things that I keep hearing

[<a id="00-05-30">00:05:30</a>]  like when I was a high school kid, like too many preteen pregnancy and things like that,

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  there was a concern, you know, then lately, like less than 15 years, conservative types

[<a id="00-05-41">00:05:41</a>]  of like praising themselves because the rate of teen pregnancy is so low, but they're complaining

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  what they think they did the lead to that versus what has changed in society, like social

[<a id="00-05-53">00:05:53</a>]  media phones.

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  And you know, like people are leaving the world, they're engaging less with opposite

[<a id="00-05-58">00:05:58</a>]  sex and things like that, you know, and, and I mean, it actually led to a bigger issue

[<a id="00-06-04">00:06:04</a>]  though, because now you have that whole incel shit.

[<a id="00-06-08">00:06:08</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-06-09">00:06:09</a>]  I mean, I don't know how much that is exaggerated too, cause I don't know what's going on because

[<a id="00-06-13">00:06:13</a>]  I don't know what to believe, you know, like on one hand, like all the kids I have a problem

[<a id="00-06-19">00:06:19</a>]  with playing, doing standup comedy, they have predictably, they have a same kind of point

[<a id="00-06-26">00:06:26</a>]  of view, which is hate Trump, this and that, which is whatever.

[<a id="00-06-30">00:06:30</a>]  But they don't think they're biased, you know, and they would turn on and tell me like, well,

[<a id="00-06-34">00:06:34</a>]  you're biased too, because things that you read, but my generation, we didn't have algorithm

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  dictating what to read.

[<a id="00-06-41">00:06:41</a>]  Right?

[<a id="00-06-42">00:06:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-43">00:06:43</a>]  I'm poor.

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  So you just didn't read?

[<a id="00-06-45">00:06:45</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-06-46">00:06:46</a>]  I mean, when you're poor like myself, you don't, the option for entertainment was so low.

[<a id="00-06-50">00:06:50</a>]  So what I did was I used to go to library and I'll go, I get a magazine from A to Z.

[<a id="00-06-54">00:06:54</a>]  I read everything, right?

[<a id="00-06-57">00:06:57</a>]  Because I didn't know anything.

[<a id="00-06-58">00:06:58</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-59">00:06:59</a>]  And that the thing that my friend was saying, they always reminded me three things.

[<a id="00-07-02">00:07:02</a>]  You're stupid, you're stupid and you're stupid, right?

[<a id="00-07-05">00:07:05</a>]  Good Asian upbringing.

[<a id="00-07-06">00:07:06</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-07-07">00:07:07</a>]  And also anytime you meet another stupid person, you might think they're stupid, but they also

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  know something that you don't know.

[<a id="00-07-12">00:07:12</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-07-13">00:07:13</a>]  So there's some value to that.

[<a id="00-07-14">00:07:14</a>]  So I think, and my family kind of mentioned like, it was clear to them that I'm not going

[<a id="00-07-19">00:07:19</a>]  to succeed academically, but nothing was stopped from me from reading stuff.

[<a id="00-07-24">00:07:24</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-07-25">00:07:25</a>]  So I did read, I just pick up, I literally picked from A through Z.

[<a id="00-07-29">00:07:29</a>]  I spent all day in library, just read because I don't know shit.

[<a id="00-07-32">00:07:32</a>]  So I know a little bit of everything and I tried to be open minded, but these days because

[<a id="00-07-38">00:07:38</a>]  of that fucking cell phone and they read certain ways and they think they have to behave certain

[<a id="00-07-42">00:07:42</a>]  way too, you know?

[<a id="00-07-44">00:07:44</a>]  And I don't get it, you know, I, I'm, I'm so confused about everything.

[<a id="00-07-48">00:07:48</a>]  Like when I was a kid, nobody like Asian men, but now all this dumb bitches from all over

[<a id="00-07-53">00:07:53</a>]  the world going to South Korea.

[<a id="00-07-56">00:07:56</a>]  This is your time, man.

[<a id="00-07-59">00:07:59</a>]  You know, but see, whenever Korean people tell you that they're so proud of their pop

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  culture and my response is, should you be proud of that?

[<a id="00-08-07">00:08:07</a>]  Here's the thing.

[<a id="00-08-08">00:08:08</a>]  I have this theory.

[<a id="00-08-10">00:08:10</a>]  Whenever your pop culture is big all over the world, there's an inverse relationship.

[<a id="00-08-14">00:08:14</a>]  How average person in your country are living.

[<a id="00-08-17">00:08:17</a>]  It's miserable existence.

[<a id="00-08-18">00:08:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-19">00:08:19</a>]  You know, go on.

[<a id="00-08-21">00:08:21</a>]  For example, America is such an amazing entertainment.

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  I'm telling you inverse relationship with the average person living in that country

[<a id="00-08-28">00:08:28</a>]  in the dire misery.

[<a id="00-08-30">00:08:30</a>]  True.

[<a id="00-08-31">00:08:31</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-32">00:08:32</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  Because my friend Hatham told me one time, you know, Yoshi, I'm, I'm from Yemen.

[<a id="00-08-35">00:08:35</a>]  It's a, it's a failed state.

[<a id="00-08-36">00:08:36</a>]  Basically it's a war torn country, but let me tell you something.

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  We don't have to make appointment to have dinner with our family.

[<a id="00-08-42">00:08:42</a>]  See as porous that country is and it terrible politically, the family structure is amazingly

[<a id="00-08-50">00:08:50</a>]  strong.

[<a id="00-08-51">00:08:51</a>]  Is it that when I come to places like Switzerland or no Northern America, where still that living

[<a id="00-08-59">00:08:59</a>]  standards relatively high, if not number one in terms of like per capita, something's

[<a id="00-09-06">00:09:06</a>]  not right.

[<a id="00-09-07">00:09:07</a>]  You know, what was the saying in Hamlet?

[<a id="00-09-09">00:09:09</a>]  Something's not right in the state of Denmark.

[<a id="00-09-13">00:09:13</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-09-14">00:09:14</a>]  So, but I mean it's definitely a point because like Switzerland, we, everyone, everyone pretty

[<a id="00-09-20">00:09:20</a>]  much is comfortable, um, and dog shit entertainment.

[<a id="00-09-25">00:09:25</a>]  That's why I say it's really like what, what famous thing is, even a Heidi was made by

[<a id="00-09-34">00:09:34</a>]  the Japanese.

[<a id="00-09-35">00:09:35</a>]  I keep telling you, but that's not true.

[<a id="00-09-37">00:09:37</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-09-38">00:09:38</a>]  What are you talking about?

[<a id="00-09-39">00:09:39</a>]  You know, the Heidi cartoon that made Heidi famous.

[<a id="00-09-43">00:09:43</a>]  It was Heidi was famous before that.

[<a id="00-09-45">00:09:45</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-09-46">00:09:46</a>]  She's talking about it.

[<a id="00-09-47">00:09:47</a>]  They took the cartoon animation, but Japanese, yes, that's like the gazillions iteration

[<a id="00-09-53">00:09:53</a>]  of that story.

[<a id="00-09-54">00:09:54</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-55">00:09:55</a>]  But that was the one that's what everybody knows.

[<a id="00-09-58">00:09:58</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-09-59">00:09:59</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-10-01">00:10:01</a>]  Cause nobody was reading.

[<a id="00-10-02">00:10:02</a>]  I might have a wrong perspective here because like, uh, yeah, but I watched that as a kid

[<a id="00-10-08">00:10:08</a>]  in England and the Heidi anime.

[<a id="00-10-10">00:10:10</a>]  I know what Christian is saying.

[<a id="00-10-11">00:10:11</a>]  That was famous before.

[<a id="00-10-12">00:10:12</a>]  But Japanese repackage it where everybody knows about it because originally it was a

[<a id="00-10-19">00:10:19</a>]  book written by a German.

[<a id="00-10-25">00:10:25</a>]  Are you sure about this?

[<a id="00-10-26">00:10:26</a>]  I think, who was it written by?

[<a id="00-10-28">00:10:28</a>]  It was written by a lady.

[<a id="00-10-29">00:10:29</a>]  I got to Google this.

[<a id="00-10-31">00:10:31</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  Um, it was written by a lady, um, and she was definitely not German.

[<a id="00-10-36">00:10:36</a>]  Hang on.

[<a id="00-10-37">00:10:37</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-10-38">00:10:38</a>]  We got, we got to find out.

[<a id="00-10-40">00:10:40</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-41">00:10:41</a>]  The story didn't exist until 1871, right?

[<a id="00-10-43">00:10:43</a>]  And I think the story's older than that.

[<a id="00-10-45">00:10:45</a>]  I know what you also mean too.

[<a id="00-10-46">00:10:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-47">00:10:47</a>]  I'm nitpicking.

[<a id="00-10-48">00:10:48</a>]  So her name is Johanna Heusser or Spiri and she was born in Zurich in Hirtzell.

[<a id="00-10-57">00:10:57</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-10-58">00:10:58</a>]  She is so not German.

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  She died in 1901.

[<a id="00-11-02">00:11:02</a>]  Mm-hmm.

[<a id="00-11-03">00:11:03</a>]  And there you go.

[<a id="00-11-05">00:11:05</a>]  And her hobbies were anime porn, which is how we ended up with.

[<a id="00-11-09">00:11:09</a>]  She, oh, this, this is interesting.

[<a id="00-11-12">00:11:12</a>]  She wrote numerous books.

[<a id="00-11-15">00:11:15</a>]  The only one that I know is fucking Heidi.

[<a id="00-11-19">00:11:19</a>]  She, she wrote a whole heap.

[<a id="00-11-23">00:11:23</a>]  Little Miss Grasshopper?

[<a id="00-11-24">00:11:24</a>]  Who the fuck gives a fuck?

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  Um, anyway.

[<a id="00-11-26">00:11:26</a>]  It's actually, I could say the same thing with J.K. Rowling.

[<a id="00-11-29">00:11:29</a>]  She's also known only for Harry Potter's, you know.

[<a id="00-11-32">00:11:32</a>]  Wait, she did start writing drama at one point, right?

[<a id="00-11-35">00:11:35</a>]  She had a bunch of other shit.

[<a id="00-11-37">00:11:37</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-11-38">00:11:38</a>]  She chose a male pen name for her non-Harry Potter related stuff, which is funny that

[<a id="00-11-47">00:11:47</a>]  she then went after trans people.

[<a id="00-11-51">00:11:51</a>]  I mean.

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  No, no one?

[<a id="00-11-53">00:11:53</a>]  Okay, cool.

[<a id="00-11-54">00:11:54</a>]  Yeah, no, it was good.

[<a id="00-11-55">00:11:55</a>]  She didn't go after them.

[<a id="00-11-56">00:11:56</a>]  She was feeling the truth and trans people like slugs don't like truth.

[<a id="00-12-00">00:12:00</a>]  Like, truth are like salt.

[<a id="00-12-02">00:12:02</a>]  And you just pouring on this slimy people have no regard for truth.

[<a id="00-12-09">00:12:09</a>]  I keep saying this.

[<a id="00-12-10">00:12:10</a>]  If there's ever been a person who understood fantasy, it's that fucking bitch.

[<a id="00-12-14">00:12:14</a>]  And if she's saying you're a man, you're a man.

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  You know what I mean?

[<a id="00-12-18">00:12:18</a>]  She understood what's real and what's magic, you know?

[<a id="00-12-20">00:12:20</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-12-21">00:12:21</a>]  And thank God HBO took, Warner Brothers HBO has taken her side because I think woke shit

[<a id="00-12-25">00:12:25</a>]  is finally dying away.

[<a id="00-12-27">00:12:27</a>]  Like all this fucking snow that is disappearing in the last couple of days, you know?

[<a id="00-12-30">00:12:30</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-12-31">00:12:31</a>]  And believe me.

[<a id="00-12-32">00:12:32</a>]  This morning.

[<a id="00-12-33">00:12:33</a>]  No, no, but I work in in porno and we made a lot of money of those people.

[<a id="00-12-36">00:12:36</a>]  But I'm telling you, even the older transgender people will tell you, like, what the new generation

[<a id="00-12-40">00:12:40</a>]  doing is outrageous.

[<a id="00-12-41">00:12:41</a>]  You know?

[<a id="00-12-42">00:12:42</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-12-43">00:12:43</a>]  I mean, this was in a way, there's a Dave Chappelle was talking about the one where his

[<a id="00-12-49">00:12:49</a>]  friend who killed herself.

[<a id="00-12-53">00:12:53</a>]  You've seen the one where.

[<a id="00-12-54">00:12:54</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-12-55">00:12:55</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-12-56">00:12:56</a>]  And and and despite it being a beautifully recent thing, where it's clear he's not hating

[<a id="00-13-01">00:13:01</a>]  it.

[<a id="00-13-02">00:13:02</a>]  You know, it just fucking somebody, but it's actually an interesting thing.

[<a id="00-13-07">00:13:07</a>]  I think there's certain things that it's yeah, it is a soul or shining a light in that you're

[<a id="00-13-13">00:13:13</a>]  not allowed to shine light.

[<a id="00-13-14">00:13:14</a>]  Like I got in trouble recently with this Facebook group in Zurich called Are We Dating The Same

[<a id="00-13-19">00:13:19</a>]  Guy?

[<a id="00-13-20">00:13:20</a>]  And it's a it's a Facebook group where women post pictures of dating profiles.

[<a id="00-13-24">00:13:24</a>]  And holy shit, for for me and for Switzerland, boy, did this blow up.

[<a id="00-13-30">00:13:30</a>]  And but the fundamental thing upfront, they say, we're here to protect women from predators.

[<a id="00-13-36">00:13:36</a>]  In reality, in clothes, they're just talking shit about men and laughing and being.

[<a id="00-13-42">00:13:42</a>]  And because I've got friends in the group, I got to see screenshots of everything I say.

[<a id="00-13-46">00:13:46</a>]  Of course, it goes both ways, right?

[<a id="00-13-48">00:13:48</a>]  And yeah.

[<a id="00-13-49">00:13:49</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-13-50">00:13:50</a>]  And absolutely.

[<a id="00-13-51">00:13:51</a>]  But the thing is, it's when you what they most resented was I was shining a light on

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  what they were doing.

[<a id="00-13-59">00:13:59</a>]  So it didn't matter what ever argument I would use for it began with me posting a video of

[<a id="00-14-06">00:14:06</a>]  a joke.

[<a id="00-14-07">00:14:07</a>]  But I think in in the same way, this is like the kind of the trans reaction, you're not

[<a id="00-14-12">00:14:12</a>]  allowed to even think about it.

[<a id="00-14-14">00:14:14</a>]  You just have to accept in the moment somebody says, wait, this is bullshit.

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  Then you're the enemy.

[<a id="00-14-20">00:14:20</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-21">00:14:21</a>]  I mean, at the end of the day, is this a big issue?

[<a id="00-14-22">00:14:22</a>]  No, it isn't.

[<a id="00-14-23">00:14:23</a>]  No, no, it's not a big issue.

[<a id="00-14-26">00:14:26</a>]  And if they want to make big issue out of it, that's fine.

[<a id="00-14-28">00:14:28</a>]  And I'm little biased, because I didn't make a lot of money selling that stuff, both retail

[<a id="00-14-33">00:14:33</a>]  and at the porn company.

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  But I'm telling you, if you talk to older ones, you have to be in a happy place.

[<a id="00-14-42">00:14:42</a>]  Because it's unimaginable early 90s, the amount of sympathy that people have for transgender

[<a id="00-14-49">00:14:49</a>]  people now.

[<a id="00-14-50">00:14:50</a>]  It's just science fiction.

[<a id="00-14-51">00:14:51</a>]  It's not even imaginable.

[<a id="00-14-52">00:14:52</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-53">00:14:53</a>]  Things can change for better.

[<a id="00-14-54">00:14:54</a>]  But what's going on is they're trying to abuse that.

[<a id="00-14-57">00:14:57</a>]  So there's a certain percentage that every time you know, I mean, there are people who

[<a id="00-15-03">00:15:03</a>]  tend to be transgender.

[<a id="00-15-04">00:15:04</a>]  They're not.

[<a id="00-15-05">00:15:05</a>]  They just want to get attention.

[<a id="00-15-06">00:15:06</a>]  So they're doing that.

[<a id="00-15-07">00:15:07</a>]  It's a trendy shit.

[<a id="00-15-08">00:15:08</a>]  In effect, you platform these people.

[<a id="00-15-10">00:15:10</a>]  Why?

[<a id="00-15-11">00:15:11</a>]  What do you mean?

[<a id="00-15-12">00:15:12</a>]  Because you help.

[<a id="00-15-13">00:15:13</a>]  You help selling the porn.

[<a id="00-15-14">00:15:14</a>]  Oh, yeah.

[<a id="00-15-15">00:15:15</a>]  You help popularize it, which made it mainstream.

[<a id="00-15-17">00:15:17</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-15-18">00:15:18</a>]  And because, you know, I was, you know, when you grow up with very little sex education

[<a id="00-15-26">00:15:26</a>]  and when you work at porn shop and porn world, the reality is really hard to take sometimes

[<a id="00-15-32">00:15:32</a>]  like you just don't understand, you know, 97 there was an article in U.S. News World

[<a id="00-15-40">00:15:40</a>]  Report.

[<a id="00-15-41">00:15:41</a>]  I was shocked because there was an article, there was a huge two page article about John

[<a id="00-15-44">00:15:44</a>]  Staliano who became my future boss.

[<a id="00-15-47">00:15:47</a>]  And he tested positive HIV.

[<a id="00-15-49">00:15:49</a>]  You know, I'm stunned by that.

[<a id="00-15-51">00:15:51</a>]  And two, it was through a transgender person from Brazil.

[<a id="00-15-55">00:15:55</a>]  So like I didn't understand any of it.

[<a id="00-15-57">00:15:57</a>]  You know, but after that, I think I understand that sexuality is a lot more fluid and complicated

[<a id="00-16-03">00:16:03</a>]  and people give you so like Brody Stevens used to say, I'm 10 percent gay.

[<a id="00-16-09">00:16:09</a>]  Kind of makes sense.

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  I mean, you're not 100 percent or masculine anymore than some women or 100 percent feminine.

[<a id="00-16-14">00:16:14</a>]  So I understand that, you know, and if somebody was a man pretending to be a woman, it's their

[<a id="00-16-20">00:16:20</a>]  business, it's not my place to tell them you're a man or whatever, because there's plenty

[<a id="00-16-26">00:16:26</a>]  of stand up comedians think they're stars and they're not.

[<a id="00-16-30">00:16:30</a>]  But it's not my job to ruin their day by saying how unfunny you are.

[<a id="00-16-36">00:16:36</a>]  And there's no chance in hell you're going to do anything.

[<a id="00-16-39">00:16:39</a>]  This took me off the beat.

[<a id="00-16-41">00:16:41</a>]  You're stealing very famous people's comedians jokes and you can't even deliver those jokes.

[<a id="00-16-47">00:16:47</a>]  I wish I could go name a shame, but you know, I mean, like I live in L.A., it's the land

[<a id="00-16-54">00:16:54</a>]  of delusion and fantasy and dreams.

[<a id="00-16-59">00:16:59</a>]  I'm not going to ruin them, but I know, you know, like sometimes I'm wrong about somebody

[<a id="00-17-04">00:17:04</a>]  become huge star that was wrong about it.

[<a id="00-17-06">00:17:06</a>]  But the vast majority of time they live in the fantasy.

[<a id="00-17-09">00:17:09</a>]  But isn't that the thing, though, when someone then does get famous and then everyone goes

[<a id="00-17-13">00:17:13</a>]  like, oh, he always or they always were saying, like, I'm going to be the big wig.

[<a id="00-17-18">00:17:18</a>]  And then we all applaud.

[<a id="00-17-21">00:17:21</a>]  What's that fucking story with Jim Carrey putting in he he wrote a 10 million, 10 million

[<a id="00-17-28">00:17:28</a>]  blah, blah, blah.

[<a id="00-17-29">00:17:29</a>]  Check whatever.

[<a id="00-17-30">00:17:30</a>]  And go like, yeah, I'm going to this is my driver.

[<a id="00-17-33">00:17:33</a>]  Imagine if he never became a millionaire and then no one will give a look.

[<a id="00-17-37">00:17:37</a>]  I know.

[<a id="00-17-38">00:17:38</a>]  I know stories like that, because every time somebody becomes successful, they tell those

[<a id="00-17-42">00:17:42</a>]  stories like that's amazing, but there's there's like nine million other cases they do something

[<a id="00-17-46">00:17:46</a>]  like that.

[<a id="00-17-47">00:17:47</a>]  It's red conned.

[<a id="00-17-48">00:17:48</a>]  It's like the whole story is red conned because you're it never works that way.

[<a id="00-17-52">00:17:52</a>]  So I mean, it worked for him, I guess.

[<a id="00-17-55">00:17:55</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-17-56">00:17:56</a>]  But but again, it's the way of portrayal.

[<a id="00-17-59">00:17:59</a>]  You can only portray that story as a success after the fact.

[<a id="00-18-02">00:18:02</a>]  Like it.

[<a id="00-18-03">00:18:03</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-04">00:18:04</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-05">00:18:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-06">00:18:06</a>]  It's like saying I wipe my butt 12 times for fame, like with a piece of toilet paper because

[<a id="00-18-09">00:18:09</a>]  I saved on the toilet paper and that money I put.

[<a id="00-18-13">00:18:13</a>]  It's ridiculous, everyone.

[<a id="00-18-15">00:18:15</a>]  But Brody, you actually knew Brody, like Zag, Brody Stevens, you mentioned Brody Stevens.

[<a id="00-18-22">00:18:22</a>]  Did you know Brody?

[<a id="00-18-23">00:18:23</a>]  Of course.

[<a id="00-18-24">00:18:24</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-25">00:18:25</a>]  And then what I think is funny that people who are mean to him and giving hard time and

[<a id="00-18-30">00:18:30</a>]  they're in tears because they're fucking attention whore at the funerals and they don't didn't

[<a id="00-18-34">00:18:34</a>]  really know him.

[<a id="00-18-35">00:18:35</a>]  I know you hate it.

[<a id="00-18-36">00:18:36</a>]  But I really respect Chelsea, I really respect Chelsea Hintler because she knows she's a

[<a id="00-18-42">00:18:42</a>]  bitch.

[<a id="00-18-43">00:18:43</a>]  She act like a bitch and she didn't even come to his funeral.

[<a id="00-18-45">00:18:45</a>]  I really respect her for that.

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-48">00:18:48</a>]  For not making.

[<a id="00-18-49">00:18:49</a>]  No, because I mean, I'm sure she wasn't happy he killed himself, but she's not going to

[<a id="00-18-53">00:18:53</a>]  pretend like they're buddies.

[<a id="00-18-55">00:18:55</a>]  And I went to one of the taping, she was mean to him, you know, but at least she's she's

[<a id="00-19-00">00:19:00</a>]  not a fake.

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  And it's really refreshing to see that.

[<a id="00-19-03">00:19:03</a>]  And these fucking whores.

[<a id="00-19-07">00:19:07</a>]  I've seen people pass business card at funerals and stuff.

[<a id="00-19-10">00:19:10</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-19-11">00:19:11</a>]  It is.

[<a id="00-19-12">00:19:12</a>]  It is funny.

[<a id="00-19-13">00:19:13</a>]  It's funny.

[<a id="00-19-14">00:19:14</a>]  But like I see I see terrible things, but these motherfuckers actually do that, you know, like

[<a id="00-19-23">00:19:23</a>]  or they want to they want to get autograph at the urinal store.

[<a id="00-19-26">00:19:26</a>]  I've seen that too.

[<a id="00-19-28">00:19:28</a>]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[<a id="00-19-30">00:19:30</a>]  That's not cool.

[<a id="00-19-32">00:19:32</a>]  At the pisser, you don't have to look at the autograph.

[<a id="00-19-36">00:19:36</a>]  You piss on their leg, then that's what they are.

[<a id="00-19-39">00:19:39</a>]  You just turn mid piss, like just piss on their leg.

[<a id="00-19-43">00:19:43</a>]  I think it's a thing because I think you see way less of that in New York City, but I don't

[<a id="00-19-48">00:19:48</a>]  know.

[<a id="00-19-49">00:19:49</a>]  I just think it's so funny.

[<a id="00-19-50">00:19:50</a>]  Like I don't think over here, specifically in Switzerland, we don't really have that

[<a id="00-19-55">00:19:55</a>]  glorification of success because we don't you're so far away, you know, not I'm just

[<a id="00-20-02">00:20:02</a>]  I'm just telling you not just physical distance, but it's so far away, you know, from success

[<a id="00-20-08">00:20:08</a>]  in general.

[<a id="00-20-09">00:20:09</a>]  No, no, no, I'm not.

[<a id="00-20-10">00:20:10</a>]  I'm not saying you.

[<a id="00-20-12">00:20:12</a>]  You could be successful anywhere with online.

[<a id="00-20-15">00:20:15</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-16">00:20:16</a>]  Good comparison here.

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  So see, like Roger Federer, probably the most famous person with a Swiss passport right now

[<a id="00-20-24">00:20:24</a>]  in New York, when he would walk down the street, he will be harassed constantly.

[<a id="00-20-29">00:20:29</a>]  Is that right?

[<a id="00-20-30">00:20:30</a>]  Totally.

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  There's people going up to him asking for autographs.

[<a id="00-20-33">00:20:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-34">00:20:34</a>]  He could walk down the middle of Zurich, no give a flying fuck.

[<a id="00-20-37">00:20:37</a>]  Is that right?

[<a id="00-20-38">00:20:38</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-39">00:20:39</a>]  Why?

[<a id="00-20-40">00:20:40</a>]  What's the thinking behind that?

[<a id="00-20-41">00:20:41</a>]  It's people just I mean, we like Tina Turner made a point about this when she moved here.

[<a id="00-20-45">00:20:45</a>]  She was like, I can actually live a life here.

[<a id="00-20-49">00:20:49</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-50">00:20:50</a>]  Without being constantly harassed.

[<a id="00-20-51">00:20:51</a>]  I mean, well, it could be all kinds of different reason for that one.

[<a id="00-20-55">00:20:55</a>]  Oh, yeah, she come on.

[<a id="00-21-02">00:21:02</a>]  Oh, fuck.

[<a id="00-21-03">00:21:03</a>]  I remember there was a story I don't know if it was Paris or something, but Oprah went

[<a id="00-21-06">00:21:06</a>]  to one of those fancy store.

[<a id="00-21-08">00:21:08</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-09">00:21:09</a>]  Where she didn't got served for the back.

[<a id="00-21-11">00:21:11</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  And then it sounds insane because not only she one of the most famous person in the whole

[<a id="00-21-16">00:21:16</a>]  world, but one of the richest women in the world, you know, right.

[<a id="00-21-20">00:21:20</a>]  But I know sometimes I guess you don't even notice things, you know, no, but so I'm not

[<a id="00-21-26">00:21:26</a>]  sure why Swiss people specifically react the way that they do react it to maybe Swiss people

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  are dignifying people that no, but I know I know that they are not like you are not

[<a id="00-21-39">00:21:39</a>]  dignified.

[<a id="00-21-40">00:21:40</a>]  You know, but it's it's but there's a certain like they cite you have politicians taking

[<a id="00-21-43">00:21:43</a>]  public transport.

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  Totally.

[<a id="00-21-45">00:21:45</a>]  But you can see I've even I think it's a sense of privacy.

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  That's that's what it is.

[<a id="00-21-51">00:21:51</a>]  People love their privacy, which I know other issues.

[<a id="00-21-55">00:21:55</a>]  So they're really bad at talking to people.

[<a id="00-21-57">00:21:57</a>]  So they don't seriously so they don't want to talk.

[<a id="00-21-59">00:21:59</a>]  They wouldn't know what to say in the first place.

[<a id="00-22-03">00:22:03</a>]  That makes news about every quarter.

[<a id="00-22-07">00:22:07</a>]  There's a news article about how foreigners in Switzerland suffer because Swiss people

[<a id="00-22-12">00:22:12</a>]  are so hard to talk to.

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  I see this.

[<a id="00-22-16">00:22:16</a>]  This is really weird to me because I'm so antisocial.

[<a id="00-22-19">00:22:19</a>]  I love the fact that nobody want to talk to me in Japan, too.

[<a id="00-22-22">00:22:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-22-23">00:22:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-22-24">00:22:24</a>]  I'm not really dependent on I mean, of course, I'm dependent if I go to a restaurant, I need

[<a id="00-22-27">00:22:27</a>]  to be served and I pay them and get the food that's transactional.

[<a id="00-22-30">00:22:30</a>]  You're not going to the restaurant waiting that the guy next to you starts throwing up

[<a id="00-22-34">00:22:34</a>]  a conversation.

[<a id="00-22-35">00:22:35</a>]  Yeah, I don't.

[<a id="00-22-36">00:22:36</a>]  It's not necessary.

[<a id="00-22-37">00:22:37</a>]  It's not important to me, you know, because I think I could always find something to preoccupy

[<a id="00-22-39">00:22:39</a>]  myself.

[<a id="00-22-40">00:22:40</a>]  I mean, look at all the things you can learn your fucking cell phone if you wanted to.

[<a id="00-22-42">00:22:42</a>]  I mean, we keep saying social media is bad.

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  Online stuff is bad.

[<a id="00-22-46">00:22:46</a>]  But there's plenty of good stuff.

[<a id="00-22-47">00:22:47</a>]  People just don't want to do that because they're fucking lazy and stupid because learning

[<a id="00-22-50">00:22:50</a>]  is suffering.

[<a id="00-22-51">00:22:51</a>]  And people don't want to suffer.

[<a id="00-22-53">00:22:53</a>]  Who can I just say, who is this person?

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  We're talking yesterday.

[<a id="00-22-57">00:22:57</a>]  You were so chilled out and now because I was sleepy.

[<a id="00-23-01">00:23:01</a>]  I was sleepy.

[<a id="00-23-02">00:23:02</a>]  And then you had sleep.

[<a id="00-23-03">00:23:03</a>]  I had some sleep finally.

[<a id="00-23-04">00:23:04</a>]  But I think the rhythm started to normalise and now and now the redneck, I love this.

[<a id="00-23-11">00:23:11</a>]  It's redneck.

[<a id="00-23-12">00:23:12</a>]  But then Bertrand Russell says something like most people rather die than think.

[<a id="00-23-18">00:23:18</a>]  And they mostly do die because they don't want to think.

[<a id="00-23-22">00:23:22</a>]  Thinking and learning is suffering.

[<a id="00-23-24">00:23:24</a>]  And people don't want to suffer.

[<a id="00-23-25">00:23:25</a>]  Yeah, fair enough.

[<a id="00-23-26">00:23:26</a>]  That's why I never got far.

[<a id="00-23-28">00:23:28</a>]  And I think sometimes living in too much comfort is not a good for you.

[<a id="00-23-33">00:23:33</a>]  And I think you pay a price for that, you know, and I think.

[<a id="00-23-37">00:23:37</a>]  So that ties back to shitty culture.

[<a id="00-23-39">00:23:39</a>]  So do you reckon Switzerland is too well off to actually have good culture?

[<a id="00-23-48">00:23:48</a>]  There's nothing wrong with being safe and taking care of your family.

[<a id="00-23-51">00:23:51</a>]  Yeah, but it's boring as fuck.

[<a id="00-23-53">00:23:53</a>]  Like, there was not a single good movie written.

[<a id="00-23-56">00:23:56</a>]  Like the best movie director out of Switzerland, Mark Foster.

[<a id="00-24-02">00:24:02</a>]  Oh, is he Swiss?

[<a id="00-24-03">00:24:03</a>]  He's Swiss.

[<a id="00-24-04">00:24:04</a>]  Wait, did he make one of the James Bond movies?

[<a id="00-24-07">00:24:07</a>]  Yeah, the one that's shite.

[<a id="00-24-08">00:24:08</a>]  It's like the worst James Bond movie with Daniel Craig was made by a Swiss guy.

[<a id="00-24-12">00:24:12</a>]  Well, to be fair, isn't it?

[<a id="00-24-14">00:24:14</a>]  It wasn't that made during the writers strike, if I remember right.

[<a id="00-24-18">00:24:18</a>]  Because they kind of spit it up.

[<a id="00-24-20">00:24:20</a>]  Oh, it was too.

[<a id="00-24-23">00:24:23</a>]  It was kind of, you know, I'm trying to be fair with the guy.

[<a id="00-24-26">00:24:26</a>]  At the Kama desert or something.

[<a id="00-24-27">00:24:27</a>]  It was a difficult time to work on when you have a writers strike, to be fair.

[<a id="00-24-31">00:24:31</a>]  And it was the beginning of work.

[<a id="00-24-33">00:24:33</a>]  It was the beginning of them taking down James Bond as a, as a evil white male patriarch.

[<a id="00-24-40">00:24:40</a>]  It was really the first movie that was just as the whole wokeness was starting to blow

[<a id="00-24-45">00:24:45</a>]  up.

[<a id="00-24-46">00:24:46</a>]  Oh, I didn't make that connection at all.

[<a id="00-24-47">00:24:47</a>]  And they tried to make James Bond a nice guy.

[<a id="00-24-48">00:24:48</a>]  I didn't, I feel conflicting because I love Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag.

[<a id="00-24-53">00:24:53</a>]  She was wonderful.

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  And she wrote the last James Bond movie.

[<a id="00-24-56">00:24:56</a>]  But I think anybody who is like old school, like myself, I know a lot of people pick Sean

[<a id="00-25-01">00:25:01</a>]  Connery as number one, but out of all of them, I have to say Roger Morris, the funniest.

[<a id="00-25-06">00:25:06</a>]  But my favorite was Daniel Craig because I think something about being violent and psychopathic

[<a id="00-25-12">00:25:12</a>]  spy is the most appealing part because that's what he is.

[<a id="00-25-15">00:25:15</a>]  I mean, he brought grit back to the whole culture.

[<a id="00-25-18">00:25:18</a>]  Roger Moore was a spoof kind of like it was and it became cartoonish.

[<a id="00-25-23">00:25:23</a>]  I mean, he was funny and a great and he was also weirdly respectful women, which is not

[<a id="00-25-29">00:25:29</a>]  a good thing for James Bond.

[<a id="00-25-31">00:25:31</a>]  He was gay as fuck.

[<a id="00-25-32">00:25:32</a>]  He was no.

[<a id="00-25-33">00:25:33</a>]  Well, he's got a daughter.

[<a id="00-25-35">00:25:35</a>]  And he no, I mean, maybe not in real life, but he was he did a gay James Bond.

[<a id="00-25-39">00:25:39</a>]  Like, yeah, there is a point there actually.

[<a id="00-25-43">00:25:43</a>]  He was a funny guy.

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  He also said that he needed to quit playing James Bond because he was getting older and

[<a id="00-25-49">00:25:49</a>]  the women getting younger.

[<a id="00-25-50">00:25:50</a>]  He thought that was really weird.

[<a id="00-25-52">00:25:52</a>]  And I think for James Bond, that is a kind of really funny thing to say.

[<a id="00-25-56">00:25:56</a>]  But when I look, I think James Bond, you know, the reason why my father's generation is so

[<a id="00-26-02">00:26:02</a>]  infatuated with that and rest of the world, it is a fantasy, isn't it?

[<a id="00-26-07">00:26:07</a>]  It totally is a fantasy.

[<a id="00-26-08">00:26:08</a>]  Serving your country.

[<a id="00-26-09">00:26:09</a>]  But it traveled to all the wonderful places, murder every man and have sex with the highest

[<a id="00-26-14">00:26:14</a>]  a less women exactly.

[<a id="00-26-17">00:26:17</a>]  But that that show always reminded me why we need psychopath, because there is a place

[<a id="00-26-24">00:26:24</a>]  for that, just like there's a place for sharks in ocean.

[<a id="00-26-27">00:26:27</a>]  There is a need for predators keeping some order to nature, you know, and living in states,

[<a id="00-26-34">00:26:34</a>]  living with the fantasy and all the psychopaths and social path.

[<a id="00-26-38">00:26:38</a>]  You know, I think that's why I think Swiss people like that, like that bitch in Zero

[<a id="00-26-42">00:26:42</a>]  Dark Thirty.

[<a id="00-26-43">00:26:43</a>]  What?

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-45">00:26:45</a>]  What?

[<a id="00-26-46">00:26:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-47">00:26:47</a>]  She's an absolute menace.

[<a id="00-26-48">00:26:48</a>]  But that's it.

[<a id="00-26-49">00:26:49</a>]  That's an interesting because you've heard you must have heard that thing about where

[<a id="00-26-50">00:26:50</a>]  they reintroduced wolves to some valley and it changed the whole ecosystem of this valley.

[<a id="00-26-56">00:26:56</a>]  There's you can YouTube that.

[<a id="00-26-58">00:26:58</a>]  But I forget where this might be.

[<a id="00-27-00">00:27:00</a>]  Canada might be America.

[<a id="00-27-01">00:27:01</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  And they it's basically about reintroducing wolves actually ends up changing the course

[<a id="00-27-09">00:27:09</a>]  of the area without a wolves.

[<a id="00-27-11">00:27:11</a>]  They needed a natural predator.

[<a id="00-27-12">00:27:12</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-27-13">00:27:13</a>]  There was no no like alpha apex predator apex predator.

[<a id="00-27-17">00:27:17</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-27-18">00:27:18</a>]  You have to because then if you don't have predators, you have a bunch of fat animals

[<a id="00-27-22">00:27:22</a>]  or fat people.

[<a id="00-27-23">00:27:23</a>]  And they were just they were destroying the river.

[<a id="00-27-25">00:27:25</a>]  The river had kind of gone straight.

[<a id="00-27-27">00:27:27</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-27-28">00:27:28</a>]  And so does that mean that culturally we need to introduce wolves to Switzerland to write

[<a id="00-27-32">00:27:32</a>]  better books?

[<a id="00-27-33">00:27:33</a>]  I mean, is that what it boils down to?

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  We need a bit of like murdering.

[<a id="00-27-39">00:27:39</a>]  I don't think I don't think you don't want too much conflict.

[<a id="00-27-43">00:27:43</a>]  But but with no conflict, that's not what's the right amount of conflict, though.

[<a id="00-27-47">00:27:47</a>]  I'd like where I think edging World War three with Putin because it was amazing to me.

[<a id="00-27-55">00:27:55</a>]  Actually, I kind of have a bit of a boner for Putin because oh, fuck me.

[<a id="00-28-00">00:28:00</a>]  This OK.

[<a id="00-28-01">00:28:01</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-28-02">00:28:02</a>]  Here's here's the thing.

[<a id="00-28-03">00:28:03</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-28-04">00:28:04</a>]  I don't.

[<a id="00-28-05">00:28:05</a>]  This is back to how we used to do the podcast.

[<a id="00-28-06">00:28:06</a>]  I introduced an interesting idea.

[<a id="00-28-08">00:28:08</a>]  Christian would shame me.

[<a id="00-28-09">00:28:09</a>]  I guess.

[<a id="00-28-10">00:28:10</a>]  No, no.

[<a id="00-28-11">00:28:11</a>]  Go on.

[<a id="00-28-12">00:28:12</a>]  Here's the thing.

[<a id="00-28-13">00:28:13</a>]  This is the whole situation with Putin.

[<a id="00-28-14">00:28:14</a>]  There's a couple of guys.

[<a id="00-28-15">00:28:15</a>]  Colonel Douglas McGregor.

[<a id="00-28-17">00:28:17</a>]  In the Iraq War, there's another guy called Scott Ritter.

[<a id="00-28-20">00:28:20</a>]  He was a weapons inspector for the UN.

[<a id="00-28-22">00:28:22</a>]  He was CIA trained.

[<a id="00-28-24">00:28:24</a>]  These guys, if you if you check out anything they're publishing at the moment online, they're

[<a id="00-28-29">00:28:29</a>]  saying we need to fucking stop trolling Russia.

[<a id="00-28-32">00:28:32</a>]  The whole stuff.

[<a id="00-28-33">00:28:33</a>]  What trolling Russia.

[<a id="00-28-34">00:28:34</a>]  OK, but what's very interesting about the situation is in the West, we're acting like

[<a id="00-28-40">00:28:40</a>]  there's no consequence for our actions.

[<a id="00-28-43">00:28:43</a>]  So we keep trolling Russia.

[<a id="00-28-45">00:28:45</a>]  And thankfully, Putin is an extremely smart, rational dude, because if he was an actual

[<a id="00-28-52">00:28:52</a>]  evil dictator, he would have fired off the nukes like like two years ago.

[<a id="00-28-56">00:28:56</a>]  I say they were with no expertise and I don't know what I'm talking about, but I never thought

[<a id="00-29-01">00:29:01</a>]  Russia was a threat.

[<a id="00-29-02">00:29:02</a>]  And they started being a threat a long time ago.

[<a id="00-29-04">00:29:04</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-29-05">00:29:05</a>]  But United States needs a new enemy, just like every new TV season needs a new villain.

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  So why didn't they opt for China?

[<a id="00-29-12">00:29:12</a>]  They tried.

[<a id="00-29-13">00:29:13</a>]  They've been doing that.

[<a id="00-29-14">00:29:14</a>]  It's funny.

[<a id="00-29-15">00:29:15</a>]  And it's easier.

[<a id="00-29-16">00:29:16</a>]  What's funny to me as American, Russia is kind of our doppelganger.

[<a id="00-29-21">00:29:21</a>]  I mean, they're large like we are.

[<a id="00-29-22">00:29:22</a>]  They have an ethnic diversity.

[<a id="00-29-26">00:29:26</a>]  But I'm calling Chinese enemy that be racism.

[<a id="00-29-30">00:29:30</a>]  So the convenient one is pick somebody that so white trash, a bunch of vodka drinking

[<a id="00-29-36">00:29:36</a>]  Russians and they need they just have to revive this.

[<a id="00-29-41">00:29:41</a>]  And it's are you saying that wars went vogue?

[<a id="00-29-44">00:29:44</a>]  I mean, is it because like Vietnam was the last proper racist war.

[<a id="00-29-49">00:29:49</a>]  Is that what you're saying?

[<a id="00-29-50">00:29:50</a>]  No, no.

[<a id="00-29-51">00:29:51</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-29-52">00:29:52</a>]  I mean, Iraq and Afghanistan is saying the American dream was built on always having

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  an enemy.

[<a id="00-29-59">00:29:59</a>]  That's the whole always.

[<a id="00-30-01">00:30:01</a>]  There's always like we're the good guys.

[<a id="00-30-03">00:30:03</a>]  Those are the bad guys.

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  You got to have the bad guy or America starts for we have to we have to manufacture one.

[<a id="00-30-10">00:30:10</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-30-11">00:30:11</a>]  Russia is perfect because it's far enough away.

[<a id="00-30-13">00:30:13</a>]  You're right.

[<a id="00-30-14">00:30:14</a>]  It is like a doppelganger is inverse like Russia has because because I think I think

[<a id="00-30-18">00:30:18</a>]  it's racist to present every mob bad guys like a Russian dog and like nobody really

[<a id="00-30-24">00:30:24</a>]  say that.

[<a id="00-30-25">00:30:25</a>]  You know, when when all this feminists are saying we have to step up rape.

[<a id="00-30-32">00:30:32</a>]  Of course, I agree.

[<a id="00-30-33">00:30:33</a>]  Who doesn't agree with that?

[<a id="00-30-34">00:30:34</a>]  But anytime they talk about men getting rape and pressing he they laugh about that.

[<a id="00-30-39">00:30:39</a>]  But they're basically saying rape is wrong except there's few exceptions to tolerate

[<a id="00-30-43">00:30:43</a>]  rape.

[<a id="00-30-44">00:30:44</a>]  That's always the problem, isn't it?

[<a id="00-30-45">00:30:45</a>]  You should tolerate any rape at any level.

[<a id="00-30-48">00:30:48</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-30-49">00:30:49</a>]  And so when they're attacking Russians, you're saying they tolerate certain amount of racism.

[<a id="00-30-52">00:30:52</a>]  It's okay.

[<a id="00-30-53">00:30:53</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  That's acceptable racism, you know.

[<a id="00-30-57">00:30:57</a>]  And I'm saying you should have a racism at all.

[<a id="00-31-00">00:31:00</a>]  But we don't believe that we do like racism.

[<a id="00-31-03">00:31:03</a>]  We love war.

[<a id="00-31-05">00:31:05</a>]  And I mean, who's bigger threat to America?

[<a id="00-31-08">00:31:08</a>]  If I have to pick enemy and I determine who our enemy based on what kind of porn people

[<a id="00-31-14">00:31:14</a>]  watch.

[<a id="00-31-15">00:31:15</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-31-16">00:31:16</a>]  And to me, working at the porn show for years, the one that was always concerned is Chinese.

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  And the reason why Chinese customers are biggest concern based on what they watch, because

[<a id="00-31-26">00:31:26</a>]  every time they order movies, the porn have to have something to do with their work, workplace

[<a id="00-31-33">00:31:33</a>]  or fucking their boss.

[<a id="00-31-34">00:31:34</a>]  And the why I think that's a problematic, because even the time of fantasy, these motherfuckers

[<a id="00-31-39">00:31:39</a>]  are thinking about work.

[<a id="00-31-43">00:31:43</a>]  It's fucking sick.

[<a id="00-31-44">00:31:44</a>]  Mexicans work hard, but when they get porn, they're thinking about getting movie with

[<a id="00-31-48">00:31:48</a>]  two chicas, you know, and cerveza, you know, they're normal, like multiple women, things

[<a id="00-31-53">00:31:53</a>]  like that.

[<a id="00-31-54">00:31:54</a>]  They're normal.

[<a id="00-31-55">00:31:55</a>]  Right?

[<a id="00-31-56">00:31:56</a>]  Or Japanese, octopus porn, whatever.

[<a id="00-32-00">00:32:00</a>]  But anyone, even when they're relaxing, they're thinking about work, they are the biggest

[<a id="00-32-04">00:32:04</a>]  threat to everyone.

[<a id="00-32-06">00:32:06</a>]  And Chinese, boy, they work the fuck.

[<a id="00-32-10">00:32:10</a>]  I mean, they beat Jamaicans, Mexicans, you name it, you know, but I thought it was really

[<a id="00-32-14">00:32:14</a>]  funny that I always have something to do with, I want to have a porn where I'm fucking at

[<a id="00-32-18">00:32:18</a>]  work and fucking the boss.

[<a id="00-32-19">00:32:19</a>]  Like these people, they're over time in fantasy time, you know what I'm saying?

[<a id="00-32-24">00:32:24</a>]  They are spreading Africa at the alarming rate, but what, why is they're spreading everywhere

[<a id="00-32-29">00:32:29</a>]  and they are using this cultural education of business institution, like, you know, expiring

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  prosperity to a free market, but they're, they're basically extension of a state arms

[<a id="00-32-44">00:32:44</a>]  and legs all over the place.

[<a id="00-32-47">00:32:47</a>]  And you think Chinese people are happy?

[<a id="00-32-50">00:32:50</a>]  You think Asian people are happy people?

[<a id="00-32-52">00:32:52</a>]  Do we, do we, do we, do you, do you find Asians like happy-go-lucky?

[<a id="00-32-57">00:32:57</a>]  Even when they're good at break dancing, it's more like a technical skill, not because we're

[<a id="00-33-01">00:33:01</a>]  so loving, like, like all those retards in France and Italy and Spain, they love life.

[<a id="00-33-08">00:33:08</a>]  They, they, they take too much vacation, but you can't question their love of life and

[<a id="00-33-12">00:33:12</a>]  family and enjoying life.

[<a id="00-33-15">00:33:15</a>]  There's nothing Asian about those people because Asian people are not fun people.

[<a id="00-33-21">00:33:21</a>]  We're not, we're not fun.

[<a id="00-33-23">00:33:23</a>]  So, but do-- -Are we fun?

[<a id="00-33-30">00:33:30</a>]  What does the Europeans always tell me?

[<a id="00-33-32">00:33:32</a>]  "Wow, you're very polite."

[<a id="00-33-33">00:33:33</a>]  What they're saying, "You're not Chinese."

[<a id="00-33-35">00:33:35</a>]  Am I wrong about this?

[<a id="00-33-38">00:33:38</a>]  Am I wrong?

[<a id="00-33-42">00:33:42</a>]  I know why they ran over those people in Tiananmen Square, rude motherfuckers, it's the only

[<a id="00-33-47">00:33:47</a>]  way to stop, stop the rudeness and Patrice O'Neal was right, we got in big argument,

[<a id="00-33-52">00:33:52</a>]  how much, like, you know, the first and the only time I had an argument with Patrice,

[<a id="00-33-57">00:33:57</a>]  that one time, last time I saw him, because he was on stage, he was saying something like,

[<a id="00-34-01">00:34:01</a>]  something, something, something, because, you know, I don't have any Asian friends and

[<a id="00-34-05">00:34:05</a>]  I've been sending this motherfucker porn for 10 years.

[<a id="00-34-10">00:34:10</a>]  You were Patrice's supplier, basically.

[<a id="00-34-13">00:34:13</a>]  I mean, I'm checking out other people, but sometime when he was talking about those expensive

[<a id="00-34-18">00:34:18</a>]  glass dildo, I mean, I sent some of those, too, and DVDs and things like that, but here's

[<a id="00-34-23">00:34:23</a>]  the thing-- -My head is exploding right now.

[<a id="00-34-27">00:34:27</a>]  -You should see that last text message he sent to his manager, Jonathan Branstein, where

[<a id="00-34-32">00:34:32</a>]  he was just insulting me the whole fucking time in that text, and my friend Jonathan

[<a id="00-34-35">00:34:35</a>]  print the whole text in, like, a plaque, because he was, Patrice was calling me useless, stupid,

[<a id="00-34-41">00:34:41</a>]  well, I don't know, all kinds of shit, you know, it's true, but, I mean, I don't want

[<a id="00-34-47">00:34:47</a>]  to take everything what black person is saying as legitimate, because we all have problems,

[<a id="00-34-52">00:34:52</a>]  you know, but in terms of Patrice's analysis of Asian pimpin roots, particularly Chinese,

[<a id="00-34-56">00:34:56</a>]  he was right, though, he was absolutely right, because I read it and, like, that's the thing

[<a id="00-35-01">00:35:01</a>]  with someone like Patrice, you might not like what the guy's saying, but you should just

[<a id="00-35-08">00:35:08</a>]  pause for a second and listen to what the guy's saying and think about it and be honest,

[<a id="00-35-12">00:35:12</a>]  look at yourself in the mirror, and I have to say, a big chunk of that motherfucker said

[<a id="00-35-17">00:35:17</a>]  about Chinese Asian people is true.

[<a id="00-35-20">00:35:20</a>]  -What kind of stuff are you saying about Asian people?

[<a id="00-35-24">00:35:24</a>]  -I mean, you know, he was, I mean, you got to listen to that, um...

[<a id="00-35-28">00:35:28</a>]  -Opium Anthony stuff, or...

[<a id="00-35-29">00:35:29</a>]  -Yeah, I mean, he was saying, like, delicious food, impeccable service, hard work, and there's

[<a id="00-35-35">00:35:35</a>]  no question about that.

[<a id="00-35-36">00:35:36</a>]  -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-35-38">00:35:38</a>]  -But miserable pricks, and we are.

[<a id="00-35-40">00:35:40</a>]  -True, I remember this.

[<a id="00-35-41">00:35:41</a>]  -You know, and I think, I don't like that because I go to Japan, I see so many Japanese

[<a id="00-35-53">00:35:53</a>]  with so much potential for happiness, success, innovation, something's keeping them away

[<a id="00-35-59">00:35:59</a>]  from doing that.

[<a id="00-36-01">00:36:01</a>]  Now, Chinese have too much of that, but they can't balance with politeness and not being

[<a id="00-36-07">00:36:07</a>]  so fucking loud in buses and trains and planes, you know?

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  -It's the American lifestyle, being loud in public.

[<a id="00-36-18">00:36:18</a>]  -I guess that's the hard thing these days, like, self-reflection, there's no time for

[<a id="00-36-27">00:36:27</a>]  that, you know?

[<a id="00-36-28">00:36:28</a>]  Like, when I was a kid, when you're poor, you used to daydream.

[<a id="00-36-32">00:36:32</a>]  That is a moment when you let your mind flow, it's a moment you're completely free from

[<a id="00-36-36">00:36:36</a>]  any sort of exterior intervention, right?

[<a id="00-36-41">00:36:41</a>]  Even though, you know, there's monolithic communist thing trying to, big brother trying

[<a id="00-36-45">00:36:45</a>]  to penetrate your mind, but at least you have a little bit of freedom in there.

[<a id="00-36-49">00:36:49</a>]  And because these fucking kids are always on cell phone, they don't even have daydreaming

[<a id="00-36-53">00:36:53</a>]  anymore.

[<a id="00-36-54">00:36:54</a>]  And as adults, we get so little sleep, you know, that the corporate entities literally

[<a id="00-37-04">00:37:04</a>]  control how much dream you have, actual dreaming when you're sleeping.

[<a id="00-37-09">00:37:09</a>]  And something really weird happened, you know, I think during COVID, it was first time, so

[<a id="00-37-15">00:37:15</a>]  I got fired, so first time in eight years, I was allowed to stay, really nice home, my

[<a id="00-37-21">00:37:21</a>]  friends, Stan Chen, Karen Chen, they said, "No, we're concerned about COVID, we don't,

[<a id="00-37-24">00:37:24</a>]  I think it's better that you stay with us."

[<a id="00-37-26">00:37:26</a>]  I had a guesthouse, this is the first time in a long time I actually had a place for

[<a id="00-37-30">00:37:30</a>]  myself, no intervention, because, you know, they had, they stayed in the main house, the

[<a id="00-37-35">00:37:35</a>]  COVID thing.

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  So, there was a period for four months, I was in Arizona, I was walking 10 miles a day,

[<a id="00-37-39">00:37:39</a>]  I was calling people every day to make, people that I haven't called in a while, make sure

[<a id="00-37-43">00:37:43</a>]  they are all right.

[<a id="00-37-45">00:37:45</a>]  I was taking tons of online courses, you know, but-

[<a id="00-37-48">00:37:48</a>]  - You joined the University of Phoenix.

[<a id="00-37-51">00:37:51</a>]  - They were taking a bunch of stuff, but what I thought was strange, I think this is something

[<a id="00-37-56">00:37:56</a>]  that was happening globally, that one great things about COVID, I thought people getting

[<a id="00-38-02">00:38:02</a>]  plenty of sleep and they were allowed to have dreams again, and I had a lot of friends were

[<a id="00-38-06">00:38:06</a>]  telling me during COVID, they were having more vivid dreams.

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  No, I told them, "Buddy, no, that's what's supposed to happen normally, but modern life

[<a id="00-38-16">00:38:16</a>]  has prevented us having proper sleep, dreams, and things like that, and we don't daydream

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  either."

[<a id="00-38-22">00:38:22</a>]  So, I think something weird was happening, I think from 2016 on, when Trump won, instead

[<a id="00-38-30">00:38:30</a>]  of getting calling him racist and this and that, why don't you pause for a second, like

[<a id="00-38-35">00:38:35</a>]  why did he win?

[<a id="00-38-37">00:38:37</a>]  Maybe things that we believe is not true, and one way to do that is if you're not financially

[<a id="00-38-44">00:38:44</a>]  able to do that, you try to read as many different opinions, and that's why it drives me crazy,

[<a id="00-38-51">00:38:51</a>]  all these young people, all they do is re-think, re-confirm their biases.

[<a id="00-38-57">00:38:57</a>]  I think you could learn-

[<a id="00-38-58">00:38:58</a>]  It's not by choice though, that's not by choice, that's basically what's being fed.

[<a id="00-39-03">00:39:03</a>]  You could put yourself on the side and you can go to library, you could travel the difference

[<a id="00-39-08">00:39:08</a>]  and talk to people that you don't agree with.

[<a id="00-39-10">00:39:10</a>]  This idea that you only talk to your friends is not a good healthy thing, you must talk

[<a id="00-39-14">00:39:14</a>]  to people you don't agree with, and maybe even you hate, "What do you think I'm talking

[<a id="00-39-18">00:39:18</a>]  to registered sex offenders, what do you think I'm talking to, literally like Taliban."

[<a id="00-39-23">00:39:23</a>]  Sure, I know what you're saying, but given the convenience of the access to the world

[<a id="00-39-31">00:39:31</a>]  through mobile phone, everything is curated and everything is made into an automatic bubble.

[<a id="00-39-38">00:39:38</a>]  I think happiness is something that you have to fight for and struggle with, and if what

[<a id="00-39-43">00:39:43</a>]  you want is convenience, then you're not serious about happiness.

[<a id="00-39-47">00:39:47</a>]  And let me tell you, all these fucking asshole friends of mine, they don't like their life.

[<a id="00-39-51">00:39:51</a>]  Let me tell you, you had about a one and a half years during COVID to really change your

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  life if you wanted to.

[<a id="00-39-59">00:39:59</a>]  You want to quit your job and look for something else, there's plenty of stuff online instead

[<a id="00-40-02">00:40:02</a>]  of watching Pornhub to change it, but people really don't want it.

[<a id="00-40-06">00:40:06</a>]  At the end of the day, if you really want to be happy, you can, but they don't really

[<a id="00-40-12">00:40:12</a>]  want to, they don't want to work for it.

[<a id="00-40-15">00:40:15</a>]  And every time they tell me, "I don't have the time," no, no, no, you have time.

[<a id="00-40-19">00:40:19</a>]  You didn't do it because it wasn't really important to you.

[<a id="00-40-22">00:40:22</a>]  I always go out of my way to call people if it's important.

[<a id="00-40-26">00:40:26</a>]  When I'm contacting about something and they don't return the phone call, that's fine.

[<a id="00-40-31">00:40:31</a>]  I think-

[<a id="00-40-32">00:40:32</a>]  Do you know what I'm saying here?

[<a id="00-40-33">00:40:33</a>]  I know what you're saying.

[<a id="00-40-34">00:40:34</a>]  But it's also-

[<a id="00-40-35">00:40:35</a>]  People don't care.

[<a id="00-40-36">00:40:36</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-40-37">00:40:37</a>]  But also, I get challenged because it's something I catch myself doing, is you become a reactionary

[<a id="00-40-45">00:40:45</a>]  old man.

[<a id="00-40-46">00:40:46</a>]  And the amount of stuff that, for me at my age, where I just want to get angry with people

[<a id="00-40-50">00:40:50</a>]  for their stupid shit.

[<a id="00-40-51">00:40:51</a>]  But we're-

[<a id="00-40-52">00:40:52</a>]  Well, don't do that because I understand the sense of it, but-

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  But the thing that you're saying about these children, seeing my kids and knowing some

[<a id="00-41-06">00:41:06</a>]  of their friends, we're actually, despite all the bullshit, I feel that human beings

[<a id="00-41-13">00:41:13</a>]  are undefeatable.

[<a id="00-41-16">00:41:16</a>]  And I see things from the kids now where they're tearing down stuff in a good way.

[<a id="00-41-23">00:41:23</a>]  For example, the show yesterday, these two ladies I helped out set up the show, they've

[<a id="00-41-29">00:41:29</a>]  got both a million followers, they're doing a tour.

[<a id="00-41-32">00:41:32</a>]  There's no Harvey Weinstein as their producer.

[<a id="00-41-35">00:41:35</a>]  They're doing it all themselves.

[<a id="00-41-37">00:41:37</a>]  Two extremely smart women getting on stage doing funny, cute stuff.

[<a id="00-41-42">00:41:42</a>]  I'm not saying this to be cute, but Harvey Weinstein did make good movies too.

[<a id="00-41-46">00:41:46</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-41-49">00:41:49</a>]  No, it's true.

[<a id="00-41-51">00:41:51</a>]  Despite all that channel molestation, Catholic Church have done them some good.

[<a id="00-41-55">00:41:55</a>]  This is the complicated part.

[<a id="00-41-56">00:41:56</a>]  There's a lot of good and bad that goes with these things, you know?

[<a id="00-41-58">00:41:58</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-41-59">00:41:59</a>]  That's true.

[<a id="00-42-00">00:42:00</a>]  And then-

[<a id="00-42-01">00:42:01</a>]  Apparently just now.

[<a id="00-42-02">00:42:02</a>]  But I think-

[<a id="00-42-03">00:42:03</a>]  Fighting in Switzerland, that's for sure.

[<a id="00-42-04">00:42:04</a>]  I think all of these things, it's like a transformation.

[<a id="00-42-05">00:42:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-42-06">00:42:06</a>]  Especially if you talk to the kids, as many are being dumb, there's as many being smart.

[<a id="00-42-15">00:42:15</a>]  And also, when you say people could have changed their lives or they don't want to, yeah, it's

[<a id="00-42-20">00:42:20</a>]  human nature.

[<a id="00-42-21">00:42:21</a>]  No, but it is true.

[<a id="00-42-22">00:42:22</a>]  But also, a percentage will of them, or even if they did nothing, the memory of- they have

[<a id="00-42-31">00:42:31</a>]  the experience of chilling out for a bit, that remains.

[<a id="00-42-35">00:42:35</a>]  But this has been- this is- I'm so optimistic.

[<a id="00-42-39">00:42:39</a>]  I'm glad you are, because this conversation about, "Oh, the next generation is fucked."

[<a id="00-42-44">00:42:44</a>]  But they've been saying that.

[<a id="00-42-46">00:42:46</a>]  Every single generation has said that about the next one.

[<a id="00-42-49">00:42:49</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-42-50">00:42:50</a>]  Every single one.

[<a id="00-42-51">00:42:51</a>]  This goes back to fucking ancient Greece.

[<a id="00-42-53">00:42:53</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-42-54">00:42:54</a>]  And there's this cottage industry, they're always writing these stupid books about the

[<a id="00-42-58">00:42:58</a>]  decline of America.

[<a id="00-43-00">00:43:00</a>]  I haven't used for America, that's a cottage industry in itself, and it's not that I don't

[<a id="00-43-06">00:43:06</a>]  believe America is declining, nobody wants that, nobody is stupid like Americans want

[<a id="00-43-10">00:43:10</a>]  to be burdened with being number one, you know?

[<a id="00-43-13">00:43:13</a>]  There's nothing fun about that.

[<a id="00-43-15">00:43:15</a>]  About being number one?

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  You pay a heavy price for taking that kind of responsibility too, you know?

[<a id="00-43-21">00:43:21</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-43-22">00:43:22</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-43-23">00:43:23</a>]  Sometimes it's better to be number two and number three, because you have some of the

[<a id="00-43-27">00:43:27</a>]  benefit being taught.

[<a id="00-43-28">00:43:28</a>]  The Scotty Pippen of the world.

[<a id="00-43-30">00:43:30</a>]  Yeah, but being number one can be such a stressful and stupid thing to do.

[<a id="00-43-35">00:43:35</a>]  Sure, it's isolating.

[<a id="00-43-36">00:43:36</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-43-37">00:43:37</a>]  Did you ever read Catch-22?

[<a id="00-43-38">00:43:38</a>]  Oh, yeah.

[<a id="00-43-39">00:43:39</a>]  Joseph Heller, right?

[<a id="00-43-40">00:43:40</a>]  There's a beautiful moment in there that's staying in its...

[<a id="00-43-43">00:43:43</a>]  Yosarian?

[<a id="00-43-44">00:43:44</a>]  Yosarian, yeah.

[<a id="00-43-45">00:43:45</a>]  And you identify...

[<a id="00-43-48">00:43:48</a>]  I know I look stupid, but people were surprised I read a book or two.

[<a id="00-43-55">00:43:55</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-43-56">00:43:56</a>]  But do you remember the bit...

[<a id="00-43-57">00:43:57</a>]  It's been a while, but yeah.

[<a id="00-43-59">00:43:59</a>]  There's a bit that's stationed in Italy, and there's this old Italian dude who's always

[<a id="00-44-04">00:44:04</a>]  provoking these American soldiers, and he just says, "Your basic problem is that you

[<a id="00-44-08">00:44:08</a>]  haven't had an empire yet."

[<a id="00-44-10">00:44:10</a>]  We Italians, we've had an empire, and we don't need to be number one anymore, and we're much

[<a id="00-44-15">00:44:15</a>]  happier as a result.

[<a id="00-44-18">00:44:18</a>]  And that's basically the premise of this guy.

[<a id="00-44-20">00:44:20</a>]  But it's really funny conversations between this...

[<a id="00-44-24">00:44:24</a>]  It's like America's like a child still, in a way.

[<a id="00-44-27">00:44:27</a>]  It's like, we need to be the end, we have the...

[<a id="00-44-30">00:44:30</a>]  And I think as a nation, nations grow up.

[<a id="00-44-36">00:44:36</a>]  The Russians, meanwhile, in a way, it's a doppelganger.

[<a id="00-44-38">00:44:38</a>]  I don't think Russia wants to take over the world.

[<a id="00-44-42">00:44:42</a>]  I think...

[<a id="00-44-43">00:44:43</a>]  That would be too much responsibility.

[<a id="00-44-45">00:44:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-44-46">00:44:46</a>]  And I'm assuming...

[<a id="00-44-47">00:44:47</a>]  I love those people, I love their culture, but I just don't believe they're a threat

[<a id="00-44-52">00:44:52</a>]  to the United States because... just the incompetence and corruptions, you know?

[<a id="00-44-58">00:44:58</a>]  And I think...

[<a id="00-44-59">00:44:59</a>]  I mean, their economy is literally like, what, size of France or something?

[<a id="00-45-02">00:45:02</a>]  Yeah, max.

[<a id="00-45-04">00:45:04</a>]  And when I meet them, it's just an incredible...

[<a id="00-45-09">00:45:09</a>]  I mean, they're not easily approachable, they're not easily get to know, but once you know

[<a id="00-45-16">00:45:16</a>]  them, I find them really interesting.

[<a id="00-45-18">00:45:18</a>]  And weirdly, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and people like that, right, they are spiritual people.

[<a id="00-45-25">00:45:25</a>]  And I feel bad because a lot of them have no say in what their government's doing.

[<a id="00-45-29">00:45:29</a>]  Like the whole incident with the chitchens taking over the opera house, they just killed

[<a id="00-45-35">00:45:35</a>]  everybody there.

[<a id="00-45-36">00:45:36</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-45-37">00:45:37</a>]  Most of us are hurray.

[<a id="00-45-38">00:45:38</a>]  And when people complain, they don't give a shit because in Russia, they just want strength.

[<a id="00-45-45">00:45:45</a>]  And weirdly, I kind of respect... I feel bad for the victims' family, of course, you know,

[<a id="00-45-50">00:45:50</a>]  but that's who they are.

[<a id="00-45-53">00:45:53</a>]  And America constantly want to fight those people, you know?

[<a id="00-45-57">00:45:57</a>]  It's just like I believe average Americans don't want that either.

[<a id="00-46-00">00:46:00</a>]  It's just the people who run my country.

[<a id="00-46-04">00:46:04</a>]  But why... so being number one is isolating and a competitive edge.

[<a id="00-46-11">00:46:11</a>]  Why do you think America needs an enemy constantly though?

[<a id="00-46-15">00:46:15</a>]  What did they say?

[<a id="00-46-16">00:46:16</a>]  Didn't Brad Pitt said the business America's business and the war is a good business, you

[<a id="00-46-20">00:46:20</a>]  know?

[<a id="00-46-21">00:46:21</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-46-22">00:46:22</a>]  There's money in it.

[<a id="00-46-23">00:46:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-46-24">00:46:24</a>]  Okay, fair enough.

[<a id="00-46-25">00:46:25</a>]  And yeah.

[<a id="00-46-26">00:46:26</a>]  So it's just an economic driver.

[<a id="00-46-27">00:46:27</a>]  I mean...

[<a id="00-46-28">00:46:28</a>]  But...

[<a id="00-46-29">00:46:29</a>]  Without being cynical here, like...

[<a id="00-46-30">00:46:30</a>]  But even beyond that, I think if you go places like Southwest, goddamn, people love guns

[<a id="00-46-36">00:46:36</a>]  and violence.

[<a id="00-46-38">00:46:38</a>]  That's our love.

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  That's our language, you know?

[<a id="00-46-41">00:46:41</a>]  But this is when you have nothing to do.

[<a id="00-46-43">00:46:43</a>]  Like when you go to the countryside...

[<a id="00-46-45">00:46:45</a>]  What do you mean you have nothing to do?

[<a id="00-46-46">00:46:46</a>]  You could always kill the Native Americans and Mexicans.

[<a id="00-46-49">00:46:49</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-46-50">00:46:50</a>]  So if...

[<a id="00-46-51">00:46:51</a>]  I'm not saying that's what we should do, but that's what they did.

[<a id="00-46-53">00:46:53</a>]  But when you when you live in the countryside, there's not a lot going on, right?

[<a id="00-46-57">00:46:57</a>]  So in the countryside, even in Switzerland, there's not a lot going on specifically.

[<a id="00-47-03">00:47:03</a>]  There's not a lot going on.

[<a id="00-47-04">00:47:04</a>]  So when you grow up, when you're young, this happened to me, you do stupid shit because

[<a id="00-47-10">00:47:10</a>]  there's nothing else going on.

[<a id="00-47-12">00:47:12</a>]  And if you have culture, somewhat, like a city or whatever, like New York or LA or whatever

[<a id="00-47-21">00:47:21</a>]  it may be, or here in Zurich, there is shit happening.

[<a id="00-47-26">00:47:26</a>]  So you're busy not murdering because shit is happening.

[<a id="00-47-30">00:47:30</a>]  And in the countryside, murdering is kind of like past time.

[<a id="00-47-33">00:47:33</a>]  Oh, you do like flinging dried cow shit is another like a cow shit frisbee.

[<a id="00-47-41">00:47:41</a>]  And it's yeah, I mean, I mean, it's certainly I mean, there's also an interesting thing

[<a id="00-47-46">00:47:46</a>]  of I think The Economist published this thing about the the number of teenage boys per capita

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  in the country is the strongest indicator of political instability.

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  So if you look at the country, the Economist, they published some scientific studies, social

[<a id="00-48-05">00:48:05</a>]  science.

[<a id="00-48-06">00:48:06</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-07">00:48:07</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-08">00:48:08</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-48-09">00:48:09</a>]  And there's basically saying in any country where you've got a high birth rate, high numbers

[<a id="00-48-11">00:48:11</a>]  of teenage boys, that's usually where you're going to have an uprising.

[<a id="00-48-16">00:48:16</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-17">00:48:17</a>]  And and and meanwhile, the West economists always struck me like anti young men, too.

[<a id="00-48-21">00:48:21</a>]  So go ahead.

[<a id="00-48-22">00:48:22</a>]  Okay, what's the what you just like, what's your I I don't know, I think my little bias

[<a id="00-48-31">00:48:31</a>]  because I was rereading Cormac McCarthy's Black Meridian recently.

[<a id="00-48-35">00:48:35</a>]  And that thing is basically say things like war exists even before exist in a man and

[<a id="00-48-41">00:48:41</a>]  this is something the men are inherently interested in.

[<a id="00-48-45">00:48:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-46">00:48:46</a>]  And it's kind of cynical take.

[<a id="00-48-48">00:48:48</a>]  But also also amazing, I have read so many amazing things because I never served.

[<a id="00-48-54">00:48:54</a>]  I also heard amazing things where men have done amazing bravery during such a stressful

[<a id="00-48-59">00:48:59</a>]  time as well.

[<a id="00-49-00">00:49:00</a>]  You know, it's a such a complicated, terrifying, but also wonderful thing where men have done

[<a id="00-49-06">00:49:06</a>]  terrible things.

[<a id="00-49-07">00:49:07</a>]  But there's they've done amazing thing to I mean, I met so many people in Washington

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  State growing up by military base where these guys don't really particularly care of constitution

[<a id="00-49-17">00:49:17</a>]  or U.S. government.

[<a id="00-49-19">00:49:19</a>]  They got injured, but they want to go back because they want to be with their brothers

[<a id="00-49-22">00:49:22</a>]  that arms.

[<a id="00-49-23">00:49:23</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-49-24">00:49:24</a>]  This is not like a homosexual.

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  I'm not even saying that this is something because this is like my comrades, you know.

[<a id="00-49-30">00:49:30</a>]  But that's an interesting thing because because it's young man has lost that.

[<a id="00-49-35">00:49:35</a>]  Yeah, it's men forming groups.

[<a id="00-49-38">00:49:38</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-39">00:49:39</a>]  And it's this bond that you build.

[<a id="00-49-41">00:49:41</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  Is is something that drives men and what better way than killing some other people?

[<a id="00-49-46">00:49:46</a>]  I have friends who are men.

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  They have a good relationship with their men.

[<a id="00-49-52">00:49:52</a>]  They have good relationships with their wife and they could tolerate my nonsense.

[<a id="00-49-56">00:49:56</a>]  But I have other men who are not really men at all.

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  They let their worthless, dumb, fat bitches, a wife dictate their life so they can hang

[<a id="00-50-08">00:50:08</a>]  out with me.

[<a id="00-50-10">00:50:10</a>]  But you know, and it's not like you stop talking to me like it's going to hurt my feeling.

[<a id="00-50-15">00:50:15</a>]  I don't give a shit.

[<a id="00-50-16">00:50:16</a>]  I mean, you take it easy.

[<a id="00-50-17">00:50:17</a>]  Now, you weren't that good of a friend.

[<a id="00-50-19">00:50:19</a>]  So you let your fat wife dictate your life.

[<a id="00-50-22">00:50:22</a>]  Then that's what you get.

[<a id="00-50-27">00:50:27</a>]  You're like a weak.

[<a id="00-50-28">00:50:28</a>]  You're smarter than I am, but you're weak.

[<a id="00-50-31">00:50:31</a>]  You use dating app to find some worthless bitch that is compatible with you and you're trying

[<a id="00-50-38">00:50:38</a>]  to make your misery multiply with hers.

[<a id="00-50-41">00:50:41</a>]  And I got to tolerate that because you couldn't do better.

[<a id="00-50-44">00:50:44</a>]  No, no.

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  You do me a favor by staying away from my life, you know, believe me.

[<a id="00-50-55">00:50:55</a>]  Friends are great, but you should just be happy.

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  You don't need a lot of friends.

[<a id="00-51-03">00:51:03</a>]  What is that thing?

[<a id="00-51-04">00:51:04</a>]  Dumb bar 150?

[<a id="00-51-05">00:51:05</a>]  Most people are capable only small number of associates throughout their lives.

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  So when they go big city, they lose their mind because they can't process too many fucking

[<a id="00-51-12">00:51:12</a>]  people.

[<a id="00-51-13">00:51:13</a>]  And when you get older, like, you know what you like, you don't like.

[<a id="00-51-18">00:51:18</a>]  Like if somebody, you know, this girl, I mean, some of the stuff I was wrong because I was

[<a id="00-51-24">00:51:24</a>]  too honest, you know, I wasn't doing anything.

[<a id="00-51-26">00:51:26</a>]  But once they don't want to hang out with you, that's fine.

[<a id="00-51-29">00:51:29</a>]  You know, like there's plenty of other dumb bitches out there.

[<a id="00-51-33">00:51:33</a>]  So and if you're mad at me, then what does this say about you selecting me in the big

[<a id="00-51-40">00:51:40</a>]  game with, you know, like it goes both ways.

[<a id="00-51-42">00:51:42</a>]  Like maybe I wasn't good for you, but you're attracted to people with problems, too, you

[<a id="00-51-47">00:51:47</a>]  know?

[<a id="00-51-48">00:51:48</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-51-50">00:51:50</a>]  So look, you know, I think if you really want to be happy and that's priority, you can make

[<a id="00-51-55">00:51:55</a>]  a time and effort if you want to.

[<a id="00-51-57">00:51:57</a>]  But I don't I just don't think people want to do that.

[<a id="00-52-02">00:52:02</a>]  They're comfortable being there in their misery.

[<a id="00-52-05">00:52:05</a>]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, it takes a long time.

[<a id="00-52-10">00:52:10</a>]  It's like it takes a long time to figure yourself out.

[<a id="00-52-13">00:52:13</a>]  And then and then the funny thing is, is like I think about this with my kids like 21, 18.

[<a id="00-52-20">00:52:20</a>]  They have intellectually pretty much the brain is fully formed, so they're capable of doing

[<a id="00-52-24">00:52:24</a>]  anything.

[<a id="00-52-25">00:52:25</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-52-26">00:52:26</a>]  But the but when it comes to life choices, like life throws curveballs at him.

[<a id="00-52-32">00:52:32</a>]  And they don't and and some of these things I can I can tell them, but here's how to handle

[<a id="00-52-37">00:52:37</a>]  this situation.

[<a id="00-52-38">00:52:38</a>]  But do they want to listen to their dad that they don't want to listen and be you can't

[<a id="00-52-44">00:52:44</a>]  communicate it.

[<a id="00-52-45">00:52:45</a>]  There are certain things you can only learn by experience or or somebody else saying the

[<a id="00-52-49">00:52:49</a>]  same thing, but they're different person saying to them.

[<a id="00-52-51">00:52:51</a>]  Yeah, that can happen.

[<a id="00-52-53">00:52:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-52-54">00:52:54</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-52-55">00:52:55</a>]  Brad Pitt said the same thing that you're saying to them.

[<a id="00-52-56">00:52:56</a>]  Do you listen to that?

[<a id="00-52-57">00:52:57</a>]  But I don't listen to you.

[<a id="00-52-58">00:52:58</a>]  Probably.

[<a id="00-52-59">00:52:59</a>]  But but but it's it's for me, it's like you go through bubbles of reality.

[<a id="00-53-03">00:53:03</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-04">00:53:04</a>]  It's like, I don't know.

[<a id="00-53-05">00:53:05</a>]  They say depression.

[<a id="00-53-06">00:53:06</a>]  I've been through periods of depression so many times.

[<a id="00-53-08">00:53:08</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-09">00:53:09</a>]  That if I feel it coming on, I know, OK, all this is going to suck for a week or two.

[<a id="00-53-14">00:53:14</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-15">00:53:15</a>]  I need to probably eat better, sleep better, share, do some exercise and and and then I'm

[<a id="00-53-21">00:53:21</a>]  not.

[<a id="00-53-22">00:53:22</a>]  And you could stop drinking.

[<a id="00-53-23">00:53:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-24">00:53:24</a>]  Yeah, I could do that.

[<a id="00-53-25">00:53:25</a>]  But that's that would be gone too far.

[<a id="00-53-27">00:53:27</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-28">00:53:28</a>]  And and so I'm not afraid of that experience.

[<a id="00-53-31">00:53:31</a>]  And then when I see young people going, oh, my brain, it's like, well, it's the first

[<a id="00-53-37">00:53:37</a>]  time you have this and it's going to go away and it's going to come back and go away.

[<a id="00-53-42">00:53:42</a>]  I guess I guess I'm really mean in that when I went to war torn places, you just cannot

[<a id="00-53-50">00:53:50</a>]  believe the sheer misery of their existence, you know?

[<a id="00-53-53">00:53:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-53-54">00:53:54</a>]  Andrew shows up that joke, like, you know, most of the countries begging for clean water

[<a id="00-54-00">00:54:00</a>]  and there's a plenty of clean water toilet where we sit in there, you know, like our

[<a id="00-54-04">00:54:04</a>]  standard so high.

[<a id="00-54-05">00:54:05</a>]  That's why I think the misery comes from.

[<a id="00-54-06">00:54:06</a>]  But it's so difficult to be grateful for what little we have, you know, but you live in

[<a id="00-54-13">00:54:13</a>]  Switzerland, the USA, God, you're you're pretty ahead compared to the rest of the world, you

[<a id="00-54-18">00:54:18</a>]  know?

[<a id="00-54-19">00:54:19</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-54-20">00:54:20</a>]  But these things doesn't mean anything young person because they feel like that they're

[<a id="00-54-23">00:54:23</a>]  entitled to that.

[<a id="00-54-24">00:54:24</a>]  And they have such a high standard of expectation of a certain standards, right?

[<a id="00-54-31">00:54:31</a>]  So I understand that, too, you know, but not to be too comfortable.

[<a id="00-54-38">00:54:38</a>]  I think that's a dangerous thing, too, I think.

[<a id="00-54-42">00:54:42</a>]  So what are some of the places you've been like, when did you start going to war torn

[<a id="00-54-45">00:54:45</a>]  places?

[<a id="00-54-46">00:54:46</a>]  I mean, not specifically, but there was some of the place you've been to in the recent

[<a id="00-54-51">00:54:51</a>]  years.

[<a id="00-54-52">00:54:52</a>]  There's something I think, you know, what burned me into that was when I saw my dad.

[<a id="00-55-00">00:55:00</a>]  He's a decent guy, but he was a weak guy.

[<a id="00-55-03">00:55:03</a>]  He let all his sister push him around.

[<a id="00-55-06">00:55:06</a>]  And he worked in insurance company, which is risk averse business to begin with.

[<a id="00-55-11">00:55:11</a>]  But I think he had a regret not going to college or wasn't able to afford to go to one.

[<a id="00-55-17">00:55:17</a>]  And he was not able to travel overseas, you know, I think the traveling thing really burned

[<a id="00-55-21">00:55:21</a>]  into my head.

[<a id="00-55-24">00:55:24</a>]  Just as a concept?

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  Well, I mean, just saw how much that impacted my dad, you know, so whenever people are foolish

[<a id="00-55-31">00:55:31</a>]  enough to invite me, I won't fucking show up.

[<a id="00-55-33">00:55:33</a>]  It's like a vampire showing up to your house.

[<a id="00-55-37">00:55:37</a>]  You let them walk into your house, you know?

[<a id="00-55-41">00:55:41</a>]  They can't walk into your house unless you invite them.

[<a id="00-55-45">00:55:45</a>]  And that's where a lot of these people make a mistake because 99.9% of the time, nobody

[<a id="00-55-49">00:55:49</a>]  would show up, but every time somebody invite me, all right, you made a mistake.

[<a id="00-55-54">00:55:54</a>]  I will come to your fucking place whether you like it or not, you know?

[<a id="00-56-00">00:56:00</a>]  But I think I don't do anything special because at best, I'm average intelligence.

[<a id="00-56-06">00:56:06</a>]  I don't have a good personality.

[<a id="00-56-08">00:56:08</a>]  I'm not good looking.

[<a id="00-56-09">00:56:09</a>]  I'm not very personable.

[<a id="00-56-11">00:56:11</a>]  But one thing you can't beat people is actually do the thing, staying in line.

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-17">00:56:17</a>]  You know, I think Woody Allen said like 80, 90% of success in life is just showing up.

[<a id="00-56-22">00:56:22</a>]  And people ask me, "How were you able to go to the court case?"

[<a id="00-56-25">00:56:25</a>]  I mean, I just walk and stand in line.

[<a id="00-56-27">00:56:27</a>]  That's it.

[<a id="00-56-28">00:56:28</a>]  I don't really do anything special, you know?

[<a id="00-56-31">00:56:31</a>]  And how did you meet all these people overseas?

[<a id="00-56-33">00:56:33</a>]  Well, I went overseas.

[<a id="00-56-35">00:56:35</a>]  Like, how do you meet all the people overseas in my generation?

[<a id="00-56-39">00:56:39</a>]  You have to go to those places, you know?

[<a id="00-56-41">00:56:41</a>]  I boarded a plane.

[<a id="00-56-43">00:56:43</a>]  Boarded a plane.

[<a id="00-56-44">00:56:44</a>]  I like that thing I keep saying like if you're going from LA to New York, there's so many

[<a id="00-56-48">00:56:48</a>]  different ways to get there.

[<a id="00-56-49">00:56:49</a>]  You could fly.

[<a id="00-56-50">00:56:50</a>]  You could drive.

[<a id="00-56-51">00:56:51</a>]  You could take a bus.

[<a id="00-56-52">00:56:52</a>]  You could hitchhike.

[<a id="00-56-53">00:56:53</a>]  You could ride a bicycle.

[<a id="00-56-54">00:56:54</a>]  You could walk.

[<a id="00-56-55">00:56:55</a>]  You could take a boat, long way.

[<a id="00-56-57">00:56:57</a>]  But eventually, you have to leave.

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  And the thing that I didn't know you like it so much but, you know, like you could be

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  rash and leave too early without doing any preparation or you could over prepare, right?

[<a id="00-57-08">00:57:08</a>]  But eventually, if you don't leave, all the preparation is not going to do anything because

[<a id="00-57-12">00:57:12</a>]  you have to leave to make a journey happen.

[<a id="00-57-16">00:57:16</a>]  So I took a Socrates class in 1993.

[<a id="00-57-21">00:57:21</a>]  My last class, you know, it's the last class that I took before I graduated.

[<a id="00-57-26">00:57:26</a>]  And the guy keeps telling me like, you know, how great Socrates was, unexamined life is

[<a id="00-57-32">00:57:32</a>]  not worth living.

[<a id="00-57-33">00:57:33</a>]  But I told the guy like, well, you know, at that point, after graduating a couple months

[<a id="00-57-39">00:57:39</a>]  away, I realized college was such a fucking waste of time.

[<a id="00-57-42">00:57:42</a>]  That's what I learned for years.

[<a id="00-57-43">00:57:43</a>]  It was an absolute waste of time.

[<a id="00-57-45">00:57:45</a>]  And I told him like, well, over examined life is not worth living either because you have

[<a id="00-57-49">00:57:49</a>]  to live a life.

[<a id="00-57-50">00:57:50</a>]  Like, yeah, you're going too much of both way.

[<a id="00-57-54">00:57:54</a>]  The happy medium is the difficult part to figure out what which is which, you know,

[<a id="00-57-58">00:57:58</a>]  but I don't know.

[<a id="00-58-03">00:58:03</a>]  How do you get better stand up?

[<a id="00-58-04">00:58:04</a>]  I don't have any talent at all, but I guess stage time.

[<a id="00-58-08">00:58:08</a>]  Is that a good start?

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  Yeah, absolutely.

[<a id="00-58-10">00:58:10</a>]  Most likely.

[<a id="00-58-11">00:58:11</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-12">00:58:12</a>]  You know, you're lying and failed and and when things doesn't work out, it's not fun.

[<a id="00-58-18">00:58:18</a>]  But fuck, even Tom Brady hasn't won every single fucking Super Bowl.

[<a id="00-58-21">00:58:21</a>]  You know?

[<a id="00-58-22">00:58:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-23">00:58:23</a>]  I think I mean, yeah, that's also a thing of the idealization of fame and this kind

[<a id="00-58-29">00:58:29</a>]  of stuff.

[<a id="00-58-30">00:58:30</a>]  Like I have this conversation a lot with with some of the some of the comedians are getting

[<a id="00-58-34">00:58:34</a>]  started in Switzerland and they're obsessed with the fame or something.

[<a id="00-58-38">00:58:38</a>]  Some are because it's social media and we know that they need a following to be able

[<a id="00-58-42">00:58:42</a>]  to do shows in future.

[<a id="00-58-44">00:58:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-45">00:58:45</a>]  And but but I'm also I also say to my look, if I learn one thing in life, there's very

[<a id="00-58-50">00:58:50</a>]  few things that you can do that you will want to do for a long time.

[<a id="00-58-55">00:58:55</a>]  I love comedy.

[<a id="00-58-57">00:58:57</a>]  Most of all, because the way my brain works, I need something to keep it busy and comedy.

[<a id="00-59-03">00:59:03</a>]  I can't if at the moment I can figure something out, I'm bored of it.

[<a id="00-59-07">00:59:07</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-08">00:59:08</a>]  Comedy.

[<a id="00-59-09">00:59:09</a>]  I can't figure it out.

[<a id="00-59-10">00:59:10</a>]  Every time I think I've got somewhere, it comes and kicks me in the nuts.

[<a id="00-59-13">00:59:13</a>]  And that's I think that's normal and it should be that.

[<a id="00-59-15">00:59:15</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-16">00:59:16</a>]  And that's and so what I tell him is enjoy the journey.

[<a id="00-59-19">00:59:19</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-20">00:59:20</a>]  Because because there's very few things if you're smart in life that will you'll appreciate

[<a id="00-59-25">00:59:25</a>]  doing always.

[<a id="00-59-26">00:59:26</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-27">00:59:27</a>]  So the people that are like, yeah, I want to be famous in three years.

[<a id="00-59-31">00:59:31</a>]  You can also there's so much no people don't do the research.

[<a id="00-59-34">00:59:34</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-59-35">00:59:35</a>]  But the people that get fame quickly and destroys them because the moment you're up there and

[<a id="00-59-42">00:59:42</a>]  you've got this thing and it's working like hot to a girl.

[<a id="00-59-45">00:59:45</a>]  OK, yeah, she's now this thing, but let's go check her out in five years when nobody

[<a id="00-59-52">00:59:52</a>]  wants to hear her bullshit anymore.

[<a id="00-59-54">00:59:54</a>]  And she's got you.

[<a id="00-59-55">00:59:55</a>]  But you will see, you know, I mean, OK, maybe she's a bad example, but there's a common

[<a id="01-00-01">01:00:01</a>]  thing is, yeah, you get someone who gets fame too early because they're a one trick pony.

[<a id="01-00-07">01:00:07</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-08">01:00:08</a>]  And they didn't develop all the other tricks.

[<a id="01-00-10">01:00:10</a>]  So they're not there.

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  But can I tell you something?

[<a id="01-00-12">01:00:12</a>]  They live in LA.

[<a id="01-00-13">01:00:13</a>]  That's still a good problem because my friends were good at stuff.

[<a id="01-00-16">01:00:16</a>]  They never got that fame or whatever, you know, and it drives them crazy.

[<a id="01-00-21">01:00:21</a>]  That's a that's a really kind of tricky thing to do, because I think if you think comedy

[<a id="01-00-26">01:00:26</a>]  and you're looking for some kind of financial success and happiness, you've got to be fucking

[<a id="01-00-32">01:00:32</a>]  retarded.

[<a id="01-00-33">01:00:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-34">01:00:34</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-35">01:00:35</a>]  It's the wrong profession because it's like a tiny one percent of one percent that make

[<a id="01-00-38">01:00:38</a>]  any real money.

[<a id="01-00-39">01:00:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-40">01:00:40</a>]  I mean, even like when I met Russell Peters, I have to say he was a pretty happy guy to

[<a id="01-00-45">01:00:45</a>]  begin with.

[<a id="01-00-46">01:00:46</a>]  I don't think I mean, I know it's easy for me to say that because he made millions, but

[<a id="01-00-50">01:00:50</a>]  I don't think it would have made world difference because he could have been just cook and do

[<a id="01-00-55">01:00:55</a>]  show at night and he would have been more than fine.

[<a id="01-00-57">01:00:57</a>]  Yeah, because I think when you meet his mom, how solid of a person she is.

[<a id="01-01-02">01:01:02</a>]  She never put those crazy.

[<a id="01-01-03">01:01:03</a>]  We better be a dog.

[<a id="01-01-04">01:01:04</a>]  You know, she never did that.

[<a id="01-01-05">01:01:05</a>]  She just seemed like, just work, be faithful for your wife, blah, blah, blah, be nice to

[<a id="01-01-10">01:01:10</a>]  your brother.

[<a id="01-01-11">01:01:11</a>]  And that's it.

[<a id="01-01-12">01:01:12</a>]  And she's just a fun, wonderful person, you know.

[<a id="01-01-16">01:01:16</a>]  And he's succeeding on so many fronts.

[<a id="01-01-18">01:01:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-01-19">01:01:19</a>]  Three of those things.

[<a id="01-01-20">01:01:20</a>]  So but but the thing is, I mean, it's the same thing.

[<a id="01-01-24">01:01:24</a>]  We have one guy, Mike Kazza or Michaela Casanova, he's a comedy buddy of ours.

[<a id="01-01-30">01:01:30</a>]  He's probably the only guy making a good living off what he's doing.

[<a id="01-01-35">01:01:35</a>]  And he has a job.

[<a id="01-01-36">01:01:36</a>]  And his comedy is he does jokes that everyone appreciates, usually about the public transport

[<a id="01-01-42">01:01:42</a>]  system here.

[<a id="01-01-45">01:01:45</a>]  And he's actually a decent dude.

[<a id="01-01-47">01:01:47</a>]  He's what like, I mean, he's got probably some issues, but nothing major.

[<a id="01-01-52">01:01:52</a>]  He's just doing the work and he's found a niche for the work.

[<a id="01-01-55">01:01:55</a>]  So he's not he's not there's not so much of this self destruction going on.

[<a id="01-02-00">01:02:00</a>]  I like I don't I don't really know Bill Burr that well.

[<a id="01-02-03">01:02:03</a>]  I met him years ago.

[<a id="01-02-04">01:02:04</a>]  I see him in everyone.

[<a id="01-02-05">01:02:05</a>]  But I saw him last Sunday, a week ago, in Ojai.

[<a id="01-02-09">01:02:09</a>]  I always like his attitude because I think, look, he had a terrible relationship with

[<a id="01-02-14">01:02:14</a>]  his dad.

[<a id="01-02-16">01:02:16</a>]  And he had some therapy, but eventually he realized, okay, I've done enough talking.

[<a id="01-02-24">01:02:24</a>]  Sometimes even therapy can solve, which is inherently something is part of life, right?

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-02-30">01:02:30</a>]  But what was it, Buddha says something like life is sorrow, like, you just got to learn

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  to live with those things.

[<a id="01-02-36">01:02:36</a>]  But he always treated people well, especially somebody starting new, you know, and I think,

[<a id="01-02-41">01:02:41</a>]  yeah, is that all we need?

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  You just need a little bit of comfort, you have a place to stay.

[<a id="01-02-46">01:02:46</a>]  Hopefully you do more things that you want to do the miserable thing that you have to

[<a id="01-02-50">01:02:50</a>]  do.

[<a id="01-02-51">01:02:51</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-02-52">01:02:52</a>]  And have a little bit of self respect.

[<a id="01-02-53">01:02:53</a>]  Because if you have that, I think you're going to be okay.

[<a id="01-02-56">01:02:56</a>]  I think too many people's standards so fucking high, you know?

[<a id="01-03-00">01:03:00</a>]  Oh, interesting.

[<a id="01-03-03">01:03:03</a>]  That's the problem.

[<a id="01-03-04">01:03:04</a>]  Like competition or because you got to be better than the neighbors or what is it?

[<a id="01-03-11">01:03:11</a>]  I mean, I think Milton Friedman, that's economist, his wife, there was some kind of panel I think

[<a id="01-03-17">01:03:17</a>]  I was watching, you know, and they got a question.

[<a id="01-03-22">01:03:22</a>]  And they basically say, like, it's because you guys want home and a vacation home and

[<a id="01-03-29">01:03:29</a>]  multiple cars and mandatory X number of vacation, things like that, but come on, what are just

[<a id="01-03-35">01:03:35</a>]  possible, so I can look at history, humanity for God's sake, you know?

[<a id="01-03-42">01:03:42</a>]  We used to live in cave.

[<a id="01-03-43">01:03:43</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="01-03-44">01:03:44</a>]  That's not too high.

[<a id="01-03-45">01:03:45</a>]  I mean, I'm telling you, if you want to be happy, you can, but we all make condition

[<a id="01-03-49">01:03:49</a>]  to it.

[<a id="01-03-50">01:03:50</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-03-51">01:03:51</a>]  I'll be happy if I make six figure.

[<a id="01-03-52">01:03:52</a>]  Well, no, you won't.

[<a id="01-03-53">01:03:53</a>]  Because once you make six figures, you want seven figures, you know?

[<a id="01-03-55">01:03:55</a>]  It's just never ending, you know?

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-03-58">01:03:58</a>]  Now that, that I fully agree because every one crack whore once a month for me and a

[<a id="01-04-03">01:04:03</a>]  couple of gigs, I'm okay.

[<a id="01-04-07">01:04:07</a>]  You know what I mean?

[<a id="01-04-09">01:04:09</a>]  You're done for the day.

[<a id="01-04-10">01:04:10</a>]  I mean, Jesus, because sometime when I'm listening to my rich friends, like, holy shit, you know,

[<a id="01-04-16">01:04:16</a>]  like how much, how much sex do you need and how much more money do you need?

[<a id="01-04-20">01:04:20</a>]  You know?

[<a id="01-04-21">01:04:21</a>]  And it, and it just ties up your time because every time I've had any, anything close to

[<a id="01-04-26">01:04:26</a>]  money or stuff, it just makes a fucking ton of work.

[<a id="01-04-29">01:04:29</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  You got to do, now you've got to manage your money.

[<a id="01-04-32">01:04:32</a>]  I'm like, I just, I just wanted the money.

[<a id="01-04-34">01:04:34</a>]  You can hire someone to manage your money.

[<a id="01-04-36">01:04:36</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-04-37">01:04:37</a>]  And then I'm like, this guy's going to steal my fucking money and I'm worried about that

[<a id="01-04-40">01:04:40</a>]  shit.

[<a id="01-04-41">01:04:41</a>]  It's like, it's better to, it's really weird because I'm in a spot where I have no money

[<a id="01-04-47">01:04:47</a>]  and I'm not afraid of anything because they could sue me, but like, well, go ahead.

[<a id="01-04-49">01:04:49</a>]  I mean, you know, 50% of zero is still zero, right?

[<a id="01-04-53">01:04:53</a>]  And when people, when a bail collector called me and they threatened me, you know, like,

[<a id="01-04-57">01:04:57</a>]  well, first of all, are you going to come over and beat me up?

[<a id="01-05-00">01:05:00</a>]  No, that's illegal.

[<a id="01-05-01">01:05:01</a>]  Like, then you don't, you don't really, you can't really, you can't really threaten me,

[<a id="01-05-04">01:05:04</a>]  you know?

[<a id="01-05-05">01:05:05</a>]  Cause I think we're going to put another 30% in debt, debt, like, so why don't you make

[<a id="01-05-11">01:05:11</a>]  the 500 I owe you make a $1 billion in 500 because 0% of the zero still zero, you know

[<a id="01-05-18">01:05:18</a>]  what I mean?

[<a id="01-05-19">01:05:19</a>]  Like, and like for them to try to threaten me, it's just like, and then my friend John

[<a id="01-05-24">01:05:24</a>]  said, how could you go all these places like insurance, like, well, first of all, if I

[<a id="01-05-27">01:05:27</a>]  get injured gravely enlisted in Afghanistan or something, I'll die end of a misery.

[<a id="01-05-34">01:05:34</a>]  You know what I mean?

[<a id="01-05-35">01:05:35</a>]  Like people that people think death is terrible.

[<a id="01-05-37">01:05:37</a>]  I mean, it is, I guess, but isn't it also wonderful how wonderful death is where it's

[<a id="01-05-44">01:05:44</a>]  not terrible for you.

[<a id="01-05-45">01:05:45</a>]  Death is not terrible for you.

[<a id="01-05-47">01:05:47</a>]  It's wonderful for all my friends when I'm dead, but all the hangup I have and all the

[<a id="01-05-53">01:05:53</a>]  people that I hurt, all the things that bothers me and then all the guilty feelings I have

[<a id="01-05-58">01:05:58</a>]  and all the disappointment and, you know, and all the, some of the anxiety I have, you

[<a id="01-06-03">01:06:03</a>]  know what?

[<a id="01-06-04">01:06:04</a>]  It kills me, but I fucking kill those things too.

[<a id="01-06-06">01:06:06</a>]  You know?

[<a id="01-06-07">01:06:07</a>]  And I think, and remember we were talking about that.

[<a id="01-06-09">01:06:09</a>]  That's why when I studied terrorists, I kind of get it.

[<a id="01-06-13">01:06:13</a>]  I understand they claim they're terrorists and they're committing terrorism for, because

[<a id="01-06-18">01:06:18</a>]  I'm in part Irish Republican army, Japanese communist party or Taliban or Al Qaeda and

[<a id="01-06-25">01:06:25</a>]  things like that.

[<a id="01-06-26">01:06:26</a>]  But that might be true as well.

[<a id="01-06-29">01:06:29</a>]  But they also have a personal problems and they don't want to admit that that that's

[<a id="01-06-33">01:06:33</a>]  most likely where that wishing for death come from.

[<a id="01-06-36">01:06:36</a>]  You know?

[<a id="01-06-37">01:06:37</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-06-38">01:06:38</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-06-39">01:06:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-06-40">01:06:40</a>]  That's why we, when you, when you and I, we, when we masturbate in same room together,

[<a id="01-06-43">01:06:43</a>]  synchronized, synchronized without masturbating some young women, at least I'm thinking like,

[<a id="01-06-49">01:06:49</a>]  God, what a relief to be dead.

[<a id="01-06-51">01:06:51</a>]  Cause I, all my problem, I kill my problem with my death.

[<a id="01-06-55">01:06:55</a>]  It's what the French called the petit mort, right?

[<a id="01-06-57">01:06:57</a>]  The little debt that moment to leave a second where you forget the problems you had.

[<a id="01-07-01">01:07:01</a>]  I get it why they want to kill themselves.

[<a id="01-07-04">01:07:04</a>]  You know, you don't, you don't want to, you don't want to make too comfortable, but you

[<a id="01-07-11">01:07:11</a>]  don't want to make too miserable either.

[<a id="01-07-12">01:07:12</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-07-13">01:07:13</a>]  And the corporation and governments have completely failing that not knowing those two boundaries,

[<a id="01-07-19">01:07:19</a>]  you know?

[<a id="01-07-20">01:07:20</a>]  I was having a moment before we continue here, we are taking a quick break.

[<a id="01-07-25">01:07:25</a>]  Well, it's how much time is that?

[<a id="01-07-27">01:07:27</a>]  I just say one thing to wrap up.

[<a id="01-07-30">01:07:30</a>]  Cause one of the things here is talking to Yoshi, you think this guy's completely nuts.

[<a id="01-07-35">01:07:35</a>]  I am not, but listening to where you've gone on what we've been talking about, all the

[<a id="01-07-42">01:07:42</a>]  stuff about kids distracting themselves, nobody needs themselves a break.

[<a id="01-07-46">01:07:46</a>]  And then through to orgasm and death that actually there's a, this is some deep wisdom

[<a id="01-07-51">01:07:51</a>]  in that shit.

[<a id="01-07-52">01:07:52</a>]  If it, if anybody could actually understand what the fuck you're saying.

[<a id="01-07-57">01:07:57</a>]  Here's the, we could finish it, but if you watch when you, when you watch Sopranos, it's

[<a id="01-08-02">01:08:02</a>]  really not mobs.

[<a id="01-08-03">01:08:03</a>]  It's like the guy's problem in family.

[<a id="01-08-06">01:08:06</a>]  And when you work in the porn business and porn shop, you think it's all about fucking

[<a id="01-08-10">01:08:10</a>]  and pornography.

[<a id="01-08-11">01:08:11</a>]  But I learned hard, listen, people go come to the store, yes, they're buying sex items,

[<a id="01-08-17">01:08:17</a>]  but there's something even deeper than that.

[<a id="01-08-19">01:08:19</a>]  They're deeply lonely and unhappy, you know, and they trick themselves thinking getting

[<a id="01-08-24">01:08:24</a>]  lay will make you happy.

[<a id="01-08-26">01:08:26</a>]  I don't think so.

[<a id="01-08-27">01:08:27</a>]  I mean, you have a physiological relief and it's nice to be attractive women and physical

[<a id="01-08-34">01:08:34</a>]  contact, but God, sex sells, but sex is also exaggerated.

[<a id="01-08-42">01:08:42</a>]  It's overrated, you know?

[<a id="01-08-45">01:08:45</a>]  And I think when you're young, you're moved by biology, go crazy over it.

[<a id="01-08-49">01:08:49</a>]  But I don't know, I think it's overrated.

[<a id="01-08-52">01:08:52</a>]  That's the thing.

[<a id="01-08-53">01:08:53</a>]  It's not fun to say that because all of us are motivated by that, but you know, once

[<a id="01-08-59">01:08:59</a>]  again, something's awry, not in Denmark, but the whole planet, you know?

[<a id="01-09-05">01:09:05</a>]  That's a good point to stop.

[<a id="01-09-10">01:09:10</a>]  How much time is that?

[<a id="01-09-11">01:09:11</a>]  That's over an hour.

[<a id="01-09-12">01:09:12</a>]  Oh, wow.
