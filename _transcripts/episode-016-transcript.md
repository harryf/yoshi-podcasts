[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  That one is recording.

[<a id="00-00-30">00:00:30</a>]  All right, sorry about that.

[<a id="00-00-39">00:00:39</a>]  Is it recording?

[<a id="00-00-41">00:00:41</a>]  It is recording.

[<a id="00-00-43">00:00:43</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-00-45">00:00:45</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-00-47">00:00:47</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-00-49">00:00:49</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-00-51">00:00:51</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-00-53">00:00:53</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-00">00:01:00</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-02">00:01:02</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-06">00:01:06</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-08">00:01:08</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-10">00:01:10</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-12">00:01:12</a>]  Shit.

[<a id="00-01-14">00:01:14</a>]  Sorry about that.

[<a id="00-01-16">00:01:16</a>]  All right.

[<a id="00-01-18">00:01:18</a>]  You survived, man.

[<a id="00-01-20">00:01:20</a>]  You talked to me or Harry?

[<a id="00-01-23">00:01:23</a>]  Actually, at this point, it might be either or.

[<a id="00-01-30">00:01:30</a>]  Did you?

[<a id="00-01-32">00:01:32</a>]  You're alive.

[<a id="00-01-34">00:01:34</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-01-36">00:01:36</a>]  Since last episode, what happened?

[<a id="00-01-39">00:01:39</a>]  Just right before Christmas.

[<a id="00-01-41">00:01:41</a>]  Well, I'm a little exhausted.

[<a id="00-01-44">00:01:44</a>]  I'll be honest.

[<a id="00-01-45">00:01:45</a>]  I've been talking a lot to Christian.

[<a id="00-01-47">00:01:47</a>]  I've been...

[<a id="00-01-48">00:01:48</a>]  That's exhausting, I know.

[<a id="00-01-49">00:01:49</a>]  It was very exhausting looking at those pictures from Los Angeles

[<a id="00-01-56">00:01:56</a>]  because I'm physically here, but my mind's over there, you know?

[<a id="00-02-01">00:02:01</a>]  And when I look at those pictures, I'm just like,

[<a id="00-02-05">00:02:05</a>]  "Oh, man, I was there that road a couple months ago,"

[<a id="00-02-10">00:02:10</a>]  or, "Oh, I remember going to Opel Mike

[<a id="00-02-12">00:02:12</a>]  and around that neighborhood," and things like that, you know?

[<a id="00-02-15">00:02:15</a>]  And you missed an epic roast.

[<a id="00-02-20">00:02:20</a>]  What?

[<a id="00-02-22">00:02:22</a>]  An epic roast.

[<a id="00-02-24">00:02:24</a>]  Well, okay.

[<a id="00-02-27">00:02:27</a>]  This is not the classic L.A. reaction.

[<a id="00-02-29">00:02:29</a>]  This is no longer comedy.

[<a id="00-02-31">00:02:31</a>]  Oh, sorry.

[<a id="00-02-32">00:02:32</a>]  Seriously.

[<a id="00-02-34">00:02:34</a>]  But, yeah, it's crazy pictures.

[<a id="00-02-37">00:02:37</a>]  I didn't take it seriously because I'm a...

[<a id="00-02-40">00:02:40</a>]  I mean, you know, I moved to L.A. February 2003.

[<a id="00-02-46">00:02:46</a>]  I've been away many times, and you hear stories about,

[<a id="00-02-51">00:02:51</a>]  "Oh, there's another wildfire in Malibu."

[<a id="00-02-53">00:02:53</a>]  It's like white noise after a while, you know,

[<a id="00-02-56">00:02:56</a>]  because they've always had fires,

[<a id="00-02-58">00:02:58</a>]  but I really didn't understand the magnitude until maybe 2 1/2 days ago.

[<a id="00-03-04">00:03:04</a>]  Just too many...

[<a id="00-03-05">00:03:05</a>]  Oh, this one.

[<a id="00-03-06">00:03:06</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-03-08">00:03:08</a>]  I mean, to give you some idea, I mean, do you...

[<a id="00-03-13">00:03:13</a>]  I don't even know how to give you the quantifiable measure for acres.

[<a id="00-03-19">00:03:19</a>]  I saw an interesting one in that regard.

[<a id="00-03-22">00:03:22</a>]  So the amount of dead space now in Palisades

[<a id="00-03-30">00:03:30</a>]  is the equivalent of one Manhattan.

[<a id="00-03-33">00:03:33</a>]  It's about...I think Manhattan is like 16,500-odd acres.

[<a id="00-03-38">00:03:38</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  And Palisades is like 17,000.

[<a id="00-03-42">00:03:42</a>]  Even more, 17,000.

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  17,000.

[<a id="00-03-44">00:03:44</a>]  So basically everything in Manhattan is gone, and some.

[<a id="00-03-47">00:03:47</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-03-48">00:03:48</a>]  And it's a really nice area, you know.

[<a id="00-03-52">00:03:52</a>]  It's an extremely nice area.

[<a id="00-03-56">00:03:56</a>]  I don't go there very often, but I think recently...

[<a id="00-04-00">00:04:00</a>]  I think before I left for Europe,

[<a id="00-04-03">00:04:03</a>]  my friend Kai Nguyen, a community friend of mine,

[<a id="00-04-06">00:04:06</a>]  we drove nearby it.

[<a id="00-04-08">00:04:08</a>]  We just drove by all the murder scenes

[<a id="00-04-10">00:04:10</a>]  that I wanted to visit before I left for Los Angeles.

[<a id="00-04-12">00:04:12</a>]  So we drove like Beverly Hills to Daddy's home,

[<a id="00-04-15">00:04:15</a>]  one of Minnie's properties,

[<a id="00-04-17">00:04:17</a>]  and we also visited in Beverly Hills

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  where Menendez brothers murdered their parents,

[<a id="00-04-23">00:04:23</a>]  and we also went to near Pacific Palisades

[<a id="00-04-27">00:04:27</a>]  where the movie Star 80--

[<a id="00-04-30">00:04:30</a>]  I'm blanking all of a sudden.

[<a id="00-04-32">00:04:32</a>]  The playmate of the year was murdered by her husband.

[<a id="00-04-36">00:04:36</a>]  We went to the house not too far from--

[<a id="00-04-39">00:04:39</a>]  I don't think Pacific Palisades.

[<a id="00-04-41">00:04:41</a>]  In fact, in the movie Star 80,

[<a id="00-04-44">00:04:44</a>]  they actually filmed in the very garage

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  where the girl was murdered by her husband.

[<a id="00-04-48">00:04:48</a>]  Then he shot himself.

[<a id="00-04-49">00:04:49</a>]  So they filmed that right there.

[<a id="00-04-51">00:04:51</a>]  So we drove by it.

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  So we were driving around nearby it,

[<a id="00-04-54">00:04:54</a>]  in this area, you know, and--

[<a id="00-04-57">00:04:57</a>]  It's murdery and fiery.

[<a id="00-05-00">00:05:00</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-05-01">00:05:01</a>]  So I'm looking at those pictures like,

[<a id="00-05-04">00:05:04</a>]  I just can't believe the magnitude, you know,

[<a id="00-05-06">00:05:06</a>]  and then I find out my ex-boss's home burned down.

[<a id="00-05-09">00:05:09</a>]  Buttman, a.k.a. John Stalliano.

[<a id="00-05-12">00:05:12</a>]  His infamous porn house

[<a id="00-05-14">00:05:14</a>]  where he started filming his porn movie from the late '80s,

[<a id="00-05-17">00:05:17</a>]  that fucking house is gone, you know.

[<a id="00-05-19">00:05:19</a>]  Wow. Is that--

[<a id="00-05-20">00:05:20</a>]  It's in the middle of Malibu.

[<a id="00-05-22">00:05:22</a>]  It was at the porn archive as well.

[<a id="00-05-25">00:05:25</a>]  I don't know how much stuff he's got there,

[<a id="00-05-28">00:05:28</a>]  but if you're like a gonzo porn fan,

[<a id="00-05-31">00:05:31</a>]  then he's one of the most significant players.

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  And that house is kind of famous

[<a id="00-05-37">00:05:37</a>]  if you're into porn history.

[<a id="00-05-39">00:05:39</a>]  So I was like--

[<a id="00-05-40">00:05:40</a>]  Because my friend told me about it,

[<a id="00-05-42">00:05:42</a>]  and I thought, man, I've been there a couple of times.

[<a id="00-05-45">00:05:45</a>]  It's like--I don't know how--

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  It's almost like a comedy store burning down.

[<a id="00-05-50">00:05:50</a>]  It's like a porn version of that.

[<a id="00-05-53">00:05:53</a>]  I know it's like--

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  Where people got their break.

[<a id="00-05-56">00:05:56</a>]  Really?

[<a id="00-05-57">00:05:57</a>]  And--

[<a id="00-05-59">00:05:59</a>]  Doing your--

[<a id="00-06-00">00:06:00</a>]  I feel sad--

[<a id="00-06-01">00:06:01</a>]  Doing your first tight five in porn.

[<a id="00-06-03">00:06:03</a>]  I feel sad most--

[<a id="00-06-05">00:06:05</a>]  I mean, I should feel equally sad for anyone passing away,

[<a id="00-06-09">00:06:09</a>]  but I have particularly soft spots for two groups of people.

[<a id="00-06-13">00:06:13</a>]  One, comedians and porn stars, you know,

[<a id="00-06-15">00:06:15</a>]  because those are the two where I really spent a lot--

[<a id="00-06-18">00:06:18</a>]  of my formidable years in adult--

[<a id="00-06-21">00:06:21</a>]  Your colleagues.

[<a id="00-06-22">00:06:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  Here's a question for you regarding the fires.

[<a id="00-06-26">00:06:26</a>]  So this is incredibly devastating,

[<a id="00-06-29">00:06:29</a>]  what is going on right now.

[<a id="00-06-31">00:06:31</a>]  It's still going on.

[<a id="00-06-33">00:06:33</a>]  We spoke about this this afternoon with our friends

[<a id="00-06-36">00:06:36</a>]  that are exposed because they have houses there,

[<a id="00-06-39">00:06:39</a>]  and some of them survived houses, that is.

[<a id="00-06-42">00:06:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-43">00:06:43</a>]  Our friends--

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  And we're speaking on January 10th,

[<a id="00-06-46">00:06:46</a>]  so by the time people hear this, maybe--

[<a id="00-06-48">00:06:48</a>]  It will have changed at that point.

[<a id="00-06-50">00:06:50</a>]  What came out today was that the Kenneth fire was actually man-made.

[<a id="00-06-59">00:06:59</a>]  Have you heard about this?

[<a id="00-07-01">00:07:01</a>]  I don't know the details, but--

[<a id="00-07-03">00:07:03</a>]  So it turns out it looks like it was a homeless person.

[<a id="00-07-11">00:07:11</a>]  The arson case-- hang on, I'll bring this up.

[<a id="00-07-17">00:07:17</a>]  According to whom?

[<a id="00-07-21">00:07:21</a>]  So Time Magazine says,

[<a id="00-07-24">00:07:24</a>]  "A man was arrested on suspicion of arson on Thursday afternoon

[<a id="00-07-27">00:07:27</a>]  in the Woodland Hills near the Kenneth fire,

[<a id="00-07-29">00:07:29</a>]  which had started earlier in the afternoon."

[<a id="00-07-31">00:07:31</a>]  Wow.

[<a id="00-07-32">00:07:32</a>]  On X, formerly Twitter, the everything app,

[<a id="00-07-37">00:07:37</a>]  Los Angeles Police Department's official public information officer announced,

[<a id="00-07-43">00:07:43</a>]  "At 4.32 p.m., a radio call was generated on the 21700 block of Ybarra Road

[<a id="00-07-51">00:07:51</a>]  for a possible arson suspect.

[<a id="00-07-53">00:07:53</a>]  A mail was heard stating a suspect was attempting to light a fire.

[<a id="00-07-57">00:07:57</a>]  The suspect is in custody and was transported to Tupac station."

[<a id="00-08-02">00:08:02</a>]  Yeah, man.

[<a id="00-08-05">00:08:05</a>]  So this is where it becomes political, right?

[<a id="00-08-11">00:08:11</a>]  Like, remember the fires when Trump had his first run,

[<a id="00-08-16">00:08:16</a>]  and then he told California to clean up the forest?

[<a id="00-08-21">00:08:21</a>]  Well, I think the thing that he was saying--

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  I mean, this is not a surprise to anyone.

[<a id="00-08-26">00:08:26</a>]  He is a developer, and he doesn't like environmentalists

[<a id="00-08-29">00:08:29</a>]  or the tedious thing to go with accommodating environmentalists.

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  And I think he's also attacking political issues,

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  like some fire departments in states have priority

[<a id="00-08-43">00:08:43</a>]  of high and right kind of minority or certain gender to--

[<a id="00-08-47">00:08:47</a>]  I don't know how much that's the factor, but--

[<a id="00-08-53">00:08:53</a>]  I don't know.

[<a id="00-08-54">00:08:54</a>]  Personally, I'm okay with the idea of transsexual fire departments,

[<a id="00-09-00">00:09:00</a>]  because, you know, if it's like a female firewoman with a dick,

[<a id="00-09-03">00:09:03</a>]  she's got a backup hose on her.

[<a id="00-09-06">00:09:06</a>]  It's not going to do much, you know.

[<a id="00-09-09">00:09:09</a>]  Well, it could be a transgender man who was formerly a woman

[<a id="00-09-13">00:09:13</a>]  or whatnot, but--

[<a id="00-09-15">00:09:15</a>]  I mean, honestly, this whole thing, who do you think--

[<a id="00-09-19">00:09:19</a>]  I mean, you make it political.

[<a id="00-09-20">00:09:20</a>]  Before we get political--

[<a id="00-09-21">00:09:21</a>]  I'm not making it political.

[<a id="00-09-22">00:09:22</a>]  No, he made it political.

[<a id="00-09-23">00:09:23</a>]  No, I basically said this is what renders the conversation

[<a id="00-09-29">00:09:29</a>]  about the fire as political.

[<a id="00-09-31">00:09:31</a>]  Yeah, it's because it's now an epic real estate opportunity.

[<a id="00-09-35">00:09:35</a>]  The famous property developer president now has an epic opportunity.

[<a id="00-09-41">00:09:41</a>]  But, I mean, also there's stuff about the--

[<a id="00-09-45">00:09:45</a>]  who is it, the mayor of Los Angeles?

[<a id="00-09-48">00:09:48</a>]  Like cutting the budget to the fire department

[<a id="00-09-51">00:09:51</a>]  or the state senator or someone?

[<a id="00-09-53">00:09:53</a>]  I don't want to get into too detail because it's so soon,

[<a id="00-09-56">00:09:56</a>]  and I'm sure truth and facts will just float up eventually.

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  But I'm just having a hard time.

[<a id="00-10-04">00:10:04</a>]  The people that I can't contact, I don't know what's going on.

[<a id="00-10-08">00:10:08</a>]  That's why I'm a little worried.

[<a id="00-10-10">00:10:10</a>]  This is a very good point because right now--

[<a id="00-10-13">00:10:13</a>]  so the article that I read out before was from Time magazine.

[<a id="00-10-19">00:10:19</a>]  The Independent UK, which is, as we know,

[<a id="00-10-22">00:10:22</a>]  an incredibly reliable news source--

[<a id="00-10-24">00:10:24</a>]  Well, it's run by a Russian.

[<a id="00-10-26">00:10:26</a>]  Basically says it was a citizen's arrest.

[<a id="00-10-29">00:10:29</a>]  So I'm looking forward to how that one unfolds.

[<a id="00-10-33">00:10:33</a>]  I will wait until you jump to a conclusion.

[<a id="00-10-36">00:10:36</a>]  I just want the fire to stop.

[<a id="00-10-39">00:10:39</a>]  But, I mean, how are your people doing?

[<a id="00-10-46">00:10:46</a>]  Like anyone you want to shout out to or just--

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  I mean, yeah.

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  If I know for sure somebody I know passed away,

[<a id="00-10-54">00:10:54</a>]  I'm sure one of my friends will contact me by now.

[<a id="00-10-57">00:10:57</a>]  And every time I was able to contact them, they're fine.

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  But, you know, this is such a terrible thing to say,

[<a id="00-11-08">00:11:08</a>]  but I will say it.

[<a id="00-11-11">00:11:11</a>]  I don't want to get into everything that's been going on in Israel

[<a id="00-11-14">00:11:14</a>]  with Palestinian Jews and stuff like that

[<a id="00-11-16">00:11:16</a>]  because I don't want to take sides.

[<a id="00-11-18">00:11:18</a>]  I really don't know the detail what to make of it,

[<a id="00-11-21">00:11:21</a>]  but I will say this.

[<a id="00-11-23">00:11:23</a>]  I just feel bad for those animals in Gaza,

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  like cats and dogs and stuff.

[<a id="00-11-27">00:11:27</a>]  So I can only imagine what's going on in L.A.

[<a id="00-11-30">00:11:30</a>]  with animals and stuff, you know?

[<a id="00-11-33">00:11:33</a>]  Like, Jesus Christ, can you imagine?

[<a id="00-11-36">00:11:36</a>]  I mean, I'm sure a lot of them will go in

[<a id="00-11-38">00:11:38</a>]  and try to save the pits or whatever,

[<a id="00-11-40">00:11:40</a>]  but I saw footage of like a horse.

[<a id="00-11-42">00:11:42</a>]  Yeah, I saw that footage as well.

[<a id="00-11-44">00:11:44</a>]  Oh, God. It's locked up, you know?

[<a id="00-11-46">00:11:46</a>]  And all this fucking--

[<a id="00-11-48">00:11:48</a>]  Of course, birds are just laughing at everyone

[<a id="00-11-50">00:11:50</a>]  because they're just flying away.

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  But I guess I--

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  You know, it's one of those things,

[<a id="00-11-59">00:11:59</a>]  you really don't believe it until you see in person.

[<a id="00-12-02">00:12:02</a>]  So can I ask you this?

[<a id="00-12-04">00:12:04</a>]  You've lived in L.A. since 2003.

[<a id="00-12-06">00:12:06</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-12-08">00:12:08</a>]  You've experienced fires, you've mentioned this before,

[<a id="00-12-10">00:12:10</a>]  and they've kind of become like, oh, just another Tuesday.

[<a id="00-12-14">00:12:14</a>]  I mean, I've driven into like a Malibu Canyon,

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  there's fires, like whatever, you know?

[<a id="00-12-19">00:12:19</a>]  Like, I didn't take a sit.

[<a id="00-12-21">00:12:21</a>]  Yeah, but you have seen, like, because, again,

[<a id="00-12-24">00:12:24</a>]  in Trump's first presidency, there was quite outrageous fires,

[<a id="00-12-30">00:12:30</a>]  like, horrendous devastation, but on a smaller scale.

[<a id="00-12-34">00:12:34</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-12-36">00:12:36</a>]  But you have experienced that, so you have seen that.

[<a id="00-12-38">00:12:38</a>]  Well, there was a fire in a place called Selmar.

[<a id="00-12-40">00:12:40</a>]  I used to live there, and I think, I don't know,

[<a id="00-12-42">00:12:42</a>]  12, 13, 14 years ago, my roommate, Dave and I,

[<a id="00-12-46">00:12:46</a>]  like, should we leave, you know?

[<a id="00-12-48">00:12:48</a>]  And so we're in uphill, there's a hospital nearby,

[<a id="00-12-53">00:12:53</a>]  and we look up, there's like, you know,

[<a id="00-12-55">00:12:55</a>]  the big hill is like mountain-looking area,

[<a id="00-12-58">00:12:58</a>]  and I'm looking like, and I thought, it's still kind of far,

[<a id="00-13-02">00:13:02</a>]  like, should we pay it, should we leave?

[<a id="00-13-05">00:13:05</a>]  And as we were watching, there was a wall of fire coming down.

[<a id="00-13-09">00:13:09</a>]  That fucker goes fast, like.

[<a id="00-13-11">00:13:11</a>]  No, but the part that tripped me out was it disappeared, right?

[<a id="00-13-16">00:13:16</a>]  It's like, oh, it's gone.

[<a id="00-13-18">00:13:18</a>]  A few seconds later, it reappeared 30, 40 feet forward,

[<a id="00-13-23">00:13:23</a>]  and just the wall just reappeared, right?

[<a id="00-13-26">00:13:26</a>]  So I was like, fuck, Dave, we need to get out.

[<a id="00-13-29">00:13:29</a>]  So we drove to Evil Angel where I was working at the time,

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  so we stayed there overnight.

[<a id="00-13-34">00:13:34</a>]  We had an older neighbor, gentleman,

[<a id="00-13-37">00:13:37</a>]  he was just waterhosing their house and stuff,

[<a id="00-13-40">00:13:40</a>]  and it's not my place to tell them what to do,

[<a id="00-13-42">00:13:42</a>]  but like, man, that ain't going to do shit

[<a id="00-13-44">00:13:44</a>]  if that fire comes down in a little hose, you know?

[<a id="00-13-47">00:13:47</a>]  So I've seen fires, I've seen fire when I was a little.

[<a id="00-13-52">00:13:52</a>]  It's not exactly fire, but I was living in Washington State,

[<a id="00-13-56">00:13:56</a>]  the infamous 1980 months, and killing blew up,

[<a id="00-13-59">00:13:59</a>]  and the fucking middle of the day, it just became dark,

[<a id="00-14-02">00:14:02</a>]  and that's hundreds--

[<a id="00-14-03">00:14:03</a>]  Do you remember this?

[<a id="00-14-04">00:14:04</a>]  How could you miss it?

[<a id="00-14-05">00:14:05</a>]  It's so loud.

[<a id="00-14-06">00:14:06</a>]  It was just massively loud explosion, you know?

[<a id="00-14-09">00:14:09</a>]  And I was like, what the--

[<a id="00-14-10">00:14:10</a>]  I sometimes forget how old you are.

[<a id="00-14-12">00:14:12</a>]  So--

[<a id="00-14-13">00:14:13</a>]  No, no, very, very old.

[<a id="00-14-14">00:14:14</a>]  So I remember that.

[<a id="00-14-15">00:14:15</a>]  I remember, look, the house is getting burned down

[<a id="00-14-17">00:14:17</a>]  and things like that, but--

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  Have you heard this story about the guy who refused

[<a id="00-14-21">00:14:21</a>]  to go away from Mount St. Helens?

[<a id="00-14-23">00:14:23</a>]  He basically said, I'm dead, because he blew up,

[<a id="00-14-27">00:14:27</a>]  he's running for his life, but he basically said, I'm dead.

[<a id="00-14-31">00:14:31</a>]  He didn't run.

[<a id="00-14-32">00:14:32</a>]  He ended up not running.

[<a id="00-14-33">00:14:33</a>]  Oh, he didn't--

[<a id="00-14-34">00:14:34</a>]  He just stayed.

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  He just stayed in his house.

[<a id="00-14-36">00:14:36</a>]  It's too late.

[<a id="00-14-37">00:14:37</a>]  If you're that close, it was game over.

[<a id="00-14-38">00:14:38</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-39">00:14:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  But it was known before that it might blow up.

[<a id="00-14-43">00:14:43</a>]  Well, I mean--

[<a id="00-14-44">00:14:44</a>]  And they asked him to leave, and he refused.

[<a id="00-14-47">00:14:47</a>]  And--

[<a id="00-14-48">00:14:48</a>]  Okay, maybe we're not talking the same thing,

[<a id="00-14-50">00:14:50</a>]  because there was another guy who was like a geologist.

[<a id="00-14-52">00:14:52</a>]  He was living-- he was sitting at the top of the mountain.

[<a id="00-14-54">00:14:54</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-55">00:14:55</a>]  And when he saw that thing explode, he basically--

[<a id="00-14-57">00:14:57</a>]  the last message was, I'm dead or something like that.

[<a id="00-14-59">00:14:59</a>]  That's a different guy.

[<a id="00-15-01">00:15:01</a>]  So there was an old guy living a little bit further down

[<a id="00-15-04">00:15:04</a>]  in a hut.

[<a id="00-15-05">00:15:05</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-15-06">00:15:06</a>]  And they asked him to leave, but he was like a geriatric.

[<a id="00-15-10">00:15:10</a>]  Kind of like a loose unit as well, so it kind of lifts--

[<a id="00-15-14">00:15:14</a>]  But I also think he had a sentimental, emotional feeling

[<a id="00-15-18">00:15:18</a>]  to the home and his land, so I think he didn't want to go.

[<a id="00-15-21">00:15:21</a>]  So right now, he was in the flow of the magma, basically.

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  So all his house-- like, he was never found.

[<a id="00-15-30">00:15:30</a>]  So it was all covered up with magma.

[<a id="00-15-34">00:15:34</a>]  And there is like a signpost that identifies--

[<a id="00-15-38">00:15:38</a>]  this is where the house was.

[<a id="00-15-39">00:15:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-15-40">00:15:40</a>]  About five meters-- what is that?

[<a id="00-15-42">00:15:42</a>]  Like ten feet below the magma.

[<a id="00-15-45">00:15:45</a>]  They even had pictures-- I remember because I was a kid,

[<a id="00-15-47">00:15:47</a>]  I remember they had pictures of trucks stuck in the road,

[<a id="00-15-50">00:15:50</a>]  and there was people in the back of the truck,

[<a id="00-15-53">00:15:53</a>]  just burned to death, because by the time they were leaving,

[<a id="00-15-56">00:15:56</a>]  they got trapped by lava.

[<a id="00-15-58">00:15:58</a>]  And like, yeah.

[<a id="00-16-02">00:16:02</a>]  Okay, just one note.

[<a id="00-16-04">00:16:04</a>]  The guy's name was Harry Truman.

[<a id="00-16-07">00:16:07</a>]  Harry what?

[<a id="00-16-08">00:16:08</a>]  Harry Truman.

[<a id="00-16-09">00:16:09</a>]  It's not even a joke.

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  It's really true.

[<a id="00-16-11">00:16:11</a>]  Harry R. Truman.

[<a id="00-16-14">00:16:14</a>]  It's funny because that's the name of a former president

[<a id="00-16-16">00:16:16</a>]  of the United States.

[<a id="00-16-17">00:16:17</a>]  But that was Harry S. Truman, wasn't it?

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-19">00:16:19</a>]  Okay, so let me-- I'm going to put a hot take on this podcast.

[<a id="00-16-24">00:16:24</a>]  Literally a hot take.

[<a id="00-16-25">00:16:25</a>]  I think I know who's responsible for these things.

[<a id="00-16-29">00:16:29</a>]  Here we go.

[<a id="00-16-30">00:16:30</a>]  I think it's a retaliatory act because somebody went over

[<a id="00-16-35">00:16:35</a>]  to Ukraine recently and bombed it hard.

[<a id="00-16-39">00:16:39</a>]  Would you like to confess now, Yoshi, to your sins?

[<a id="00-16-42">00:16:42</a>]  Yes, I was in Kiev for like 30 hours.

[<a id="00-16-46">00:16:46</a>]  And you were the biggest bombing that night?

[<a id="00-16-50">00:16:50</a>]  Yeah, it was supposed to be on a Ukrainian language show,

[<a id="00-16-55">00:16:55</a>]  and they put me in the middle of it.

[<a id="00-16-58">00:16:58</a>]  And, you know, they did laugh a couple of things,

[<a id="00-17-03">00:17:03</a>]  especially when I told them, by the way, I'm from Japan.

[<a id="00-17-06">00:17:06</a>]  I keep saying that.

[<a id="00-17-08">00:17:08</a>]  They thought you were North Korean.

[<a id="00-17-10">00:17:10</a>]  Yes, because when I crossed the border,

[<a id="00-17-14">00:17:14</a>]  they were kind of being a little hard-ass,

[<a id="00-17-16">00:17:16</a>]  and like, what did I do?

[<a id="00-17-19">00:17:19</a>]  And then one of the person traveling in the bus,

[<a id="00-17-24">00:17:24</a>]  they think you're North Korean.

[<a id="00-17-26">00:17:26</a>]  And I was like, oh, you know, because Kursk,

[<a id="00-17-28">00:17:28</a>]  the region in the battle between Russia and Ukrainians,

[<a id="00-17-32">00:17:32</a>]  there is supposedly, what, 5,000, 6,000 North Korean fighting

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  on behalf of Russia.

[<a id="00-17-38">00:17:38</a>]  So they're a little bit touchy about that stuff.

[<a id="00-17-41">00:17:41</a>]  Of course, I'm not going to tell my true background.

[<a id="00-17-43">00:17:43</a>]  Like, well, I'm from Japan, but I'm not going to say that.

[<a id="00-17-45">00:17:45</a>]  I just realized someone we've got to get Yoshi hooked up with

[<a id="00-17-49">00:17:49</a>]  is Karl Pilkington, and you know he does that travel thing?

[<a id="00-17-52">00:17:52</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-17-53">00:17:53</a>]  You and Karl Pilkington--

[<a id="00-17-54">00:17:54</a>]  Two retards?

[<a id="00-17-55">00:17:55</a>]  Two retards going to-- like, why are they upset

[<a id="00-17-58">00:17:58</a>]  that an Asian-looking dude is entering Ukraine?

[<a id="00-18-01">00:18:01</a>]  I wonder why.

[<a id="00-18-05">00:18:05</a>]  Tell us your opening joke again that you still do.

[<a id="00-18-08">00:18:08</a>]  You know, I-- no, actually, they laughed, a couple of them,

[<a id="00-18-13">00:18:13</a>]  but I think--

[<a id="00-18-17">00:18:17</a>]  You told me before.

[<a id="00-18-18">00:18:18</a>]  It was the other 88 that weren't laughing

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  that were the problem.

[<a id="00-18-22">00:18:22</a>]  I was drinking not because I was scared,

[<a id="00-18-26">00:18:26</a>]  because I'm not scared of going places like that,

[<a id="00-18-28">00:18:28</a>]  but I was kind of a little moody,

[<a id="00-18-29">00:18:29</a>]  so I was drinking a little bit.

[<a id="00-18-31">00:18:31</a>]  I can't remember now if I said it on stage,

[<a id="00-18-33">00:18:33</a>]  or it could have been before the show,

[<a id="00-18-36">00:18:36</a>]  I saw a group of young Ukrainian women and asked,

[<a id="00-18-39">00:18:39</a>]  hey, what's with all the single ladies in Kiev?

[<a id="00-18-42">00:18:42</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-18-45">00:18:45</a>]  Got nothing.

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  You think?

[<a id="00-18-49">00:18:49</a>]  You sang all the single ladies?

[<a id="00-18-51">00:18:51</a>]  No, just-- I thought it was kind of funny.

[<a id="00-18-55">00:18:55</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-18-58">00:18:58</a>]  But-- and if you listen to this, it doesn't make any sense.

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  It's because all the young men are either dead or fighting.

[<a id="00-19-04">00:19:04</a>]  That's why it was kind of--

[<a id="00-19-05">00:19:05</a>]  Oh, wow.

[<a id="00-19-06">00:19:06</a>]  You haven't explained this?

[<a id="00-19-07">00:19:07</a>]  Actually, I'm surprised there are that many,

[<a id="00-19-09">00:19:09</a>]  because a lot of them have come to Switzerland.

[<a id="00-19-13">00:19:13</a>]  A lot left to sleep with random European men

[<a id="00-19-17">00:19:17</a>]  that couldn't get laid before.

[<a id="00-19-19">00:19:19</a>]  But when I was making fun of Americans,

[<a id="00-19-21">00:19:21</a>]  they were laughing at that,

[<a id="00-19-22">00:19:22</a>]  but a couple other things that just went over their head,

[<a id="00-19-24">00:19:24</a>]  and it's my fault.

[<a id="00-19-26">00:19:26</a>]  But it's one of those things

[<a id="00-19-28">00:19:28</a>]  that most American comedians don't know,

[<a id="00-19-30">00:19:30</a>]  because if you go region to region, you know, similar humor,

[<a id="00-19-34">00:19:34</a>]  but it's always mystery to me, like, oh, wow, you know,

[<a id="00-19-39">00:19:39</a>]  this particular joke got this much laugh,

[<a id="00-19-41">00:19:41</a>]  it got this much laugh.

[<a id="00-19-44">00:19:44</a>]  It doesn't make any sense.

[<a id="00-19-45">00:19:45</a>]  And this joke usually get this much laugh in stage,

[<a id="00-19-48">00:19:48</a>]  but nothing.

[<a id="00-19-49">00:19:49</a>]  And that's something that when you go overseas,

[<a id="00-19-52">00:19:52</a>]  you have opportunity to kind of figure out

[<a id="00-19-54">00:19:54</a>]  why something makes sense.

[<a id="00-19-55">00:19:55</a>]  Like, during the show, I said something like--

[<a id="00-19-57">00:19:57</a>]  I had one other joke where I make a reference to Apple Stores.

[<a id="00-20-00">00:20:00</a>]  Somebody in the back goes,

[<a id="00-20-01">00:20:01</a>]  "We don't have an Apple Store here."

[<a id="00-20-03">00:20:03</a>]  Like, what?

[<a id="00-20-04">00:20:04</a>]  So everybody started laughing, because I was confused.

[<a id="00-20-06">00:20:06</a>]  I thought he was joking.

[<a id="00-20-07">00:20:07</a>]  No, there's no Apple Store in Ukraine, period.

[<a id="00-20-10">00:20:10</a>]  I didn't know that, you know.

[<a id="00-20-13">00:20:13</a>]  And I did a couple of sex jokes that got a laugh, but--

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  I think sex doesn't need importation laws.

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-20-22">00:20:22</a>]  Right, actually, interesting.

[<a id="00-20-23">00:20:23</a>]  So you said there were Americans in the crowd?

[<a id="00-20-26">00:20:26</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-20-27">00:20:27</a>]  Well, maybe there were, but I wouldn't know.

[<a id="00-20-28">00:20:28</a>]  But they all struck me like Ukrainians,

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  because it was only Ukrainian comedy night with no English.

[<a id="00-20-35">00:20:35</a>]  They just at me last minute.

[<a id="00-20-37">00:20:37</a>]  So I'm sure there's a pretty good number of people that--

[<a id="00-20-40">00:20:40</a>]  probably doesn't speak English,

[<a id="00-20-42">00:20:42</a>]  or some of the double play with words,

[<a id="00-20-46">00:20:46</a>]  or you have to know a little bit of cultural reference to get the joke.

[<a id="00-20-49">00:20:49</a>]  I think that might have gone over their head.

[<a id="00-20-52">00:20:52</a>]  But when I say--well, I'm sorry.

[<a id="00-20-54">00:20:54</a>]  I just want to make sure you guys know that I'm from Japan,

[<a id="00-20-57">00:20:57</a>]  because people keep asking me if I'm Korean borders,

[<a id="00-21-00">00:21:00</a>]  and of course they laugh at that part, you know.

[<a id="00-21-04">00:21:04</a>]  But it's a very sophisticated club.

[<a id="00-21-07">00:21:07</a>]  I like--

[<a id="00-21-08">00:21:08</a>]  How many people were at the show?

[<a id="00-21-10">00:21:10</a>]  I can just imagine the promoter being,

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  "Oh, it's in the Ukrainian night.

[<a id="00-21-13">00:21:13</a>]  We got Yoshi. This will go great."

[<a id="00-21-16">00:21:16</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-18">00:21:18</a>]  I didn't do any fisting joke, but it's completely sold out.

[<a id="00-21-21">00:21:21</a>]  It sounds like they're completely sold out almost every single night.

[<a id="00-21-24">00:21:24</a>]  It's a well-run comedy club.

[<a id="00-21-26">00:21:26</a>]  How many--what are we talking, 100, 200?

[<a id="00-21-28">00:21:28</a>]  80 to--I think the room holds maybe 80 to 100.

[<a id="00-21-32">00:21:32</a>]  Perfect.

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  Let's go.

[<a id="00-21-34">00:21:34</a>]  I was saying the same thing.

[<a id="00-21-35">00:21:35</a>]  Also, I can just say, after you told me, because we were texting,

[<a id="00-21-39">00:21:39</a>]  you said, "I just bombed in Ukraine."

[<a id="00-21-41">00:21:41</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-42">00:21:42</a>]  And then you've been mentioning Doug Stanhope had just been there as well.

[<a id="00-21-48">00:21:48</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  Abasso, the guy who was--contact Doug and became a host,

[<a id="00-21-54">00:21:54</a>]  he helped me get a stage time, and we were talking after the show.

[<a id="00-21-58">00:21:58</a>]  And interesting guy.

[<a id="00-22-00">00:22:00</a>]  He laughed, because I told him,

[<a id="00-22-03">00:22:03</a>]  "Has people told you you look like Bob Dylan?"

[<a id="00-22-05">00:22:05</a>]  He's like, "Yeah, even Stanhope told me that."

[<a id="00-22-07">00:22:07</a>]  "But you know what you look like?

[<a id="00-22-09">00:22:09</a>]  "You look like a combination of Bob Dylan and Danny Masterson,

[<a id="00-22-13">00:22:13</a>]  "the rapists from the '70s show."

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  So he didn't know who that was.

[<a id="00-22-17">00:22:17</a>]  So he looked like a combination of Bob Dylan and the rapists.

[<a id="00-22-19">00:22:19</a>]  He added a new flavor.

[<a id="00-22-20">00:22:20</a>]  But I actually watched Doug Stanhope's set that he did,

[<a id="00-22-24">00:22:24</a>]  because it's now on YouTube.

[<a id="00-22-26">00:22:26</a>]  It's really good, man.

[<a id="00-22-27">00:22:27</a>]  What?

[<a id="00-22-28">00:22:28</a>]  The Ukraine set.

[<a id="00-22-29">00:22:29</a>]  Yeah, the Doug Stanhope.

[<a id="00-22-30">00:22:30</a>]  Oh, I didn't see it.

[<a id="00-22-32">00:22:32</a>]  Yeah, he posted it in London.

[<a id="00-22-33">00:22:33</a>]  I'm just adding to more pain, but you're not responding.

[<a id="00-22-36">00:22:36</a>]  Oh, no.

[<a id="00-22-40">00:22:40</a>]  I haven't been in style.

[<a id="00-22-42">00:22:42</a>]  There's no excuse.

[<a id="00-22-43">00:22:43</a>]  But I had a hard time reading them.

[<a id="00-22-48">00:22:48</a>]  Wait, you didn't penetrate the PTSD?

[<a id="00-22-52">00:22:52</a>]  I mean...

[<a id="00-22-53">00:22:53</a>]  I mean, maybe it's the wrong alphabet.

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-23-00">00:23:00</a>]  Sorry.

[<a id="00-23-01">00:23:01</a>]  Hey.

[<a id="00-23-02">00:23:02</a>]  I haven't had any alcohol in about two weeks.

[<a id="00-23-05">00:23:05</a>]  He said, "I'm a fucking asshole now."

[<a id="00-23-07">00:23:07</a>]  But is that the set?

[<a id="00-23-09">00:23:09</a>]  Because Basso told me, like, when he started--I didn't see it.

[<a id="00-23-12">00:23:12</a>]  But he did say, like, "Doug was speaking really slow."

[<a id="00-23-15">00:23:15</a>]  Like, "My name is Doug."

[<a id="00-23-17">00:23:17</a>]  Like, he kept kind of overexplaining stuff in the beginning.

[<a id="00-23-19">00:23:19</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-23-20">00:23:20</a>]  Then eventually, like, he realized they didn't know what he was talking about.

[<a id="00-23-23">00:23:23</a>]  So that's not an issue.

[<a id="00-23-25">00:23:25</a>]  I'm not making an excuse, but it could be that most of the people--

[<a id="00-23-28">00:23:28</a>]  I'm sure some of them spoke English, but it was specifically--

[<a id="00-23-33">00:23:33</a>]  That crowd was there for him, basically.

[<a id="00-23-36">00:23:36</a>]  I'm not saying either.

[<a id="00-23-37">00:23:37</a>]  At the night that you were at.

[<a id="00-23-39">00:23:39</a>]  Yeah, it's strictly for Ukrainian--

[<a id="00-23-41">00:23:41</a>]  It was Ukrainian night.

[<a id="00-23-42">00:23:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-23-43">00:23:43</a>]  And last thing they needed to see, the enemy trying to entertain them.

[<a id="00-23-47">00:23:47</a>]  You were the fucking pineapple in the borscht, like, "Jesus."

[<a id="00-23-52">00:23:52</a>]  But it was fun talking to him.

[<a id="00-23-54">00:23:54</a>]  And I talked to other comedians, particularly like Basso and Amiya.

[<a id="00-23-59">00:23:59</a>]  They're very nice.

[<a id="00-24-00">00:24:00</a>]  I met a bunch of other comedians, but, you know,

[<a id="00-24-02">00:24:02</a>]  they told me their names so fast.

[<a id="00-24-04">00:24:04</a>]  But I would like to go back.

[<a id="00-24-06">00:24:06</a>]  He'll take me to, assuming the war's still going on by then.

[<a id="00-24-11">00:24:11</a>]  But it looks like there's going to be, like, a podcast opportunity,

[<a id="00-24-15">00:24:15</a>]  but he took me all these different plazas where Putin said,

[<a id="00-24-21">00:24:21</a>]  "There will be Russian tanks invading Ukraine in complete control of the city."

[<a id="00-24-27">00:24:27</a>]  He said that very early in the war.

[<a id="00-24-29">00:24:29</a>]  He took me to this plaza where there was Russian tanks,

[<a id="00-24-32">00:24:32</a>]  except they were blown up to pieces.

[<a id="00-24-34">00:24:34</a>]  So it was a Ukrainian--not a sense of humor--statement saying,

[<a id="00-24-38">00:24:38</a>]  "Yeah, you're right.

[<a id="00-24-39">00:24:39</a>]  The Russian tanks are here, and they're all blown up to pieces."

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-24-43">00:24:43</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-24-44">00:24:44</a>]  That's like defiance all through the city.

[<a id="00-24-47">00:24:47</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-24-48">00:24:48</a>]  And I think--I'm not a military historian,

[<a id="00-24-51">00:24:51</a>]  but my impression the way he was talking,

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  he probably thought it was like an easy cakewalk into the country,

[<a id="00-24-57">00:24:57</a>]  just take over.

[<a id="00-24-58">00:24:58</a>]  Yeah, that's how he sold it.

[<a id="00-24-59">00:24:59</a>]  That's how he sold it to his generals as well.

[<a id="00-25-01">00:25:01</a>]  And I'm sure they're still saying that to the rest of the country, but--

[<a id="00-25-04">00:25:04</a>]  To all the--

[<a id="00-25-05">00:25:05</a>]  Ukrainians are fighting back, you know?

[<a id="00-25-07">00:25:07</a>]  The poor fucks that he's sending to their death.

[<a id="00-25-09">00:25:09</a>]  But at least, I mean, did they--you were paid to do the show.

[<a id="00-25-14">00:25:14</a>]  You didn't.

[<a id="00-25-15">00:25:15</a>]  I mean, that's fucked up because, you know,

[<a id="00-25-17">00:25:17</a>]  you could have at least got some of your U.S. taxpayers' money back.

[<a id="00-25-21">00:25:21</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-25-23">00:25:23</a>]  Like, something.

[<a id="00-25-24">00:25:24</a>]  Come on.

[<a id="00-25-26">00:25:26</a>]  I like these things that you're saying because, as a programmer,

[<a id="00-25-29">00:25:29</a>]  I could already tell you're already like,

[<a id="00-25-32">00:25:32</a>]  "Okay, I know that son of a bitch is coming back in two days

[<a id="00-25-35">00:25:35</a>]  and getting all ready."

[<a id="00-25-37">00:25:37</a>]  No, it's really I haven't drunk alcohol in quite a while.

[<a id="00-25-41">00:25:41</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-42">00:25:42</a>]  Maybe that's a good thing.

[<a id="00-25-43">00:25:43</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  It turns into a fucking asshole, it turns out.

[<a id="00-25-46">00:25:46</a>]  But--

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  It's a painful period, but you will--

[<a id="00-25-51">00:25:51</a>]  Pervade?

[<a id="00-25-52">00:25:52</a>]  No, you will--

[<a id="00-25-54">00:25:54</a>]  No, I mean, doing Dry in January is hard.

[<a id="00-25-56">00:25:56</a>]  I just can't figure out how to get it wet and--

[<a id="00-26-00">00:26:00</a>]  Fuck.

[<a id="00-26-01">00:26:01</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-26-05">00:26:05</a>]  Christian took off the glasses.

[<a id="00-26-06">00:26:06</a>]  All right.

[<a id="00-26-07">00:26:07</a>]  It's not even alcohol because Christian and I were talking about

[<a id="00-26-10">00:26:10</a>]  it's the fucking sugar part of alcohol, too.

[<a id="00-26-12">00:26:12</a>]  The sugar and there's your fucking nuts.

[<a id="00-26-14">00:26:14</a>]  It's--last year, I stopped drinking soda.

[<a id="00-26-19">00:26:19</a>]  It lasted until like 4th of July.

[<a id="00-26-21">00:26:21</a>]  Like, that's the longest--

[<a id="00-26-22">00:26:22</a>]  From the 1st of June.

[<a id="00-26-23">00:26:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-24">00:26:24</a>]  1st of January to--but I don't know what happened.

[<a id="00-26-27">00:26:27</a>]  And then on the 4th of July, you were like,

[<a id="00-26-29">00:26:29</a>]  "I'm a proper American.

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  I need a Coke."

[<a id="00-26-32">00:26:32</a>]  I was stressing over something and I need a drink.

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  And like, I don't know, I just--I cheated.

[<a id="00-26-38">00:26:38</a>]  And I said, "I'll just have one Coke."

[<a id="00-26-39">00:26:39</a>]  And of course, that was the end of that, you know.

[<a id="00-26-42">00:26:42</a>]  It was just beer, but it's also you have that--

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  what is it?

[<a id="00-26-45">00:26:45</a>]  Corn syrup or something.

[<a id="00-26-46">00:26:46</a>]  You don't have actual real sugar.

[<a id="00-26-48">00:26:48</a>]  No, it's not even sugar.

[<a id="00-26-49">00:26:49</a>]  It's like shit.

[<a id="00-26-50">00:26:50</a>]  Like--

[<a id="00-26-51">00:26:51</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-52">00:26:52</a>]  It's like--it's basically fructose, corn syrup.

[<a id="00-26-56">00:26:56</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-58">00:26:58</a>]  I mean--yeah, go ahead.

[<a id="00-27-00">00:27:00</a>]  Okay, so this is a quick recap.

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  So you left Switzerland last time.

[<a id="00-27-04">00:27:04</a>]  You fly to Romania.

[<a id="00-27-06">00:27:06</a>]  No, where did you go?

[<a id="00-27-08">00:27:08</a>]  So when we say goodbye, you're kind enough to take me

[<a id="00-27-11">00:27:11</a>]  to the train station, buy me dinner.

[<a id="00-27-14">00:27:14</a>]  I went to Berlin for the night, Budapest for the night next day.

[<a id="00-27-19">00:27:19</a>]  Then on the third day, I was in Moldova, and I was hanging--

[<a id="00-27-24">00:27:24</a>]  seeing--seeing my friend Anna and her family.

[<a id="00-27-27">00:27:27</a>]  And I was there for eight, nine days.

[<a id="00-27-30">00:27:30</a>]  I was supposed to only be there for like four or five days

[<a id="00-27-32">00:27:32</a>]  and spend like three or four days in Ukraine,

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  but I was having such a good time hanging out with them

[<a id="00-27-37">00:27:37</a>]  that I decided just--I'll just go for one day

[<a id="00-27-40">00:27:40</a>]  'cause the people that were supposed to meet in Ukraine,

[<a id="00-27-42">00:27:42</a>]  they were not able to meet.

[<a id="00-27-44">00:27:44</a>]  So these comedians friends became default,

[<a id="00-27-47">00:27:47</a>]  and they're my friends now.

[<a id="00-27-48">00:27:48</a>]  But so I went Moldova, Ukraine for a day,

[<a id="00-27-53">00:27:53</a>]  and then I spent another day next day in Poland,

[<a id="00-27-58">00:27:58</a>]  and it took 22 hours bus ride from Moldova

[<a id="00-28-03">00:28:03</a>]  to Gdansk, Poland, you know.

[<a id="00-28-07">00:28:07</a>]  And Poland's so impressive, in my opinion.

[<a id="00-28-10">00:28:10</a>]  Out of all the Slavic countries I've been to,

[<a id="00-28-12">00:28:12</a>]  it's the most sophisticated, well-run country,

[<a id="00-28-15">00:28:15</a>]  and the only thing I could say about them is they're Catholic,

[<a id="00-28-18">00:28:18</a>]  not Orthodox, and they have a really hard-ass immigration policy,

[<a id="00-28-22">00:28:22</a>]  but it's working for them.

[<a id="00-28-23">00:28:23</a>]  And it was very impressive that even like each city--

[<a id="00-28-26">00:28:26</a>]  I've been to Krakow, Warsaw, and Gdansk.

[<a id="00-28-31">00:28:31</a>]  It's a well-run city,

[<a id="00-28-33">00:28:33</a>]  and roads are way better than what it was in Ukraine,

[<a id="00-28-37">00:28:37</a>]  even before the war 'cause I've been to Ukraine 2017, 2019,

[<a id="00-28-41">00:28:41</a>]  maybe one other time.

[<a id="00-28-42">00:28:42</a>]  But I don't know why Poland's running so much better

[<a id="00-28-45">00:28:45</a>]  compared to other Slavic countries.

[<a id="00-28-46">00:28:46</a>]  I have no idea.

[<a id="00-28-47">00:28:47</a>]  I got my thick, 'cause it's partly--

[<a id="00-28-49">00:28:49</a>]  they're the last motivated Western Europeans

[<a id="00-28-52">00:28:52</a>]  or sort of Europeans aside from we've got a Russia.

[<a id="00-28-56">00:28:56</a>]  So they're so motivated when they started immigrating,

[<a id="00-29-01">00:29:01</a>]  all the dudes that can actually do stuff without immigrating.

[<a id="00-29-05">00:29:05</a>]  So England actually triggered Brexit.

[<a id="00-29-07">00:29:07</a>]  They were so good that it fucked up everything.

[<a id="00-29-10">00:29:10</a>]  'Cause you want your living room painted,

[<a id="00-29-13">00:29:13</a>]  normally that's a month of your living room covered in sheets,

[<a id="00-29-17">00:29:17</a>]  these guys drinking tea and doing--

[<a id="00-29-20">00:29:20</a>]  and then the Polish people started showing up

[<a id="00-29-22">00:29:22</a>]  and it's done in three hours.

[<a id="00-29-24">00:29:24</a>]  And it blew everybody's mind, and that's why we--

[<a id="00-29-28">00:29:28</a>]  I don't mean this insult,

[<a id="00-29-30">00:29:30</a>]  but were the Polish kind of like the Mexican of the UK?

[<a id="00-29-34">00:29:34</a>]  For a while.

[<a id="00-29-35">00:29:35</a>]  Or the Turks in Germany?

[<a id="00-29-37">00:29:37</a>]  'Cause I know they were doing the kind of job the natives--

[<a id="00-29-39">00:29:39</a>]  For a while.

[<a id="00-29-40">00:29:40</a>]  When I was a child on the farm during harvest season,

[<a id="00-29-44">00:29:44</a>]  we would always have Polish farmhands.

[<a id="00-29-48">00:29:48</a>]  I see.

[<a id="00-29-49">00:29:49</a>]  And they would stay for three months during harvest season.

[<a id="00-29-54">00:29:54</a>]  It started in July and would go until September.

[<a id="00-29-56">00:29:56</a>]  I see.

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  And they would literally come--

[<a id="00-30-00">00:30:00</a>]  I will never forget this.

[<a id="00-30-01">00:30:01</a>]  They would literally come by overland bus.

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  There was a bus--

[<a id="00-30-05">00:30:05</a>]  What is that word that you just used?

[<a id="00-30-07">00:30:07</a>]  An overland bus.

[<a id="00-30-08">00:30:08</a>]  An overland bus.

[<a id="00-30-09">00:30:09</a>]  Like a Greyhound.

[<a id="00-30-11">00:30:11</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-30-12">00:30:12</a>]  But like a specific line that just brings farmhands to the region.

[<a id="00-30-17">00:30:17</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-30-18">00:30:18</a>]  So there was tons of them, hundreds of them in the region.

[<a id="00-30-24">00:30:24</a>]  Is there still significant number of Polish people in Switzerland?

[<a id="00-30-27">00:30:27</a>]  So I think it shifted.

[<a id="00-30-29">00:30:29</a>]  I think it shifted, though.

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  So these were the generation of my parents,

[<a id="00-30-35">00:30:35</a>]  the guys that were working on the farms.

[<a id="00-30-37">00:30:37</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-30-38">00:30:38</a>]  But they always went back.

[<a id="00-30-40">00:30:40</a>]  They brought the money back into town.

[<a id="00-30-44">00:30:44</a>]  The guys that I know now,

[<a id="00-30-46">00:30:46</a>]  I work with quite a bunch of Polish people,

[<a id="00-30-49">00:30:49</a>]  and these are probably my age, maybe a little bit younger,

[<a id="00-30-51">00:30:51</a>]  maybe a bit older.

[<a id="00-30-52">00:30:52</a>]  They're probably the second generation.

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  They're parents.

[<a id="00-30-55">00:30:55</a>]  Incredibly well-educated.

[<a id="00-30-56">00:30:56</a>]  All like finance, IT, blah, blah, blah.

[<a id="00-31-00">00:31:00</a>]  So you have the whole thing.

[<a id="00-31-02">00:31:02</a>]  It kind of, yeah, it changed.

[<a id="00-31-06">00:31:06</a>]  I guess why it was so different for them

[<a id="00-31-08">00:31:08</a>]  compared to, say, Turkish people,

[<a id="00-31-09">00:31:09</a>]  because I think the Germans in the early '70s thought,

[<a id="00-31-12">00:31:12</a>]  they work all this shitty job, they eventually go home,

[<a id="00-31-14">00:31:14</a>]  which they then fast matured, did not go back.

[<a id="00-31-17">00:31:17</a>]  And I wonder, Poland wasn't that bad.

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  They're like, oh, I do want to go back.

[<a id="00-31-23">00:31:23</a>]  Germany has a different relationship to Turkey, though.

[<a id="00-31-25">00:31:25</a>]  But also, that's a very old relationship.

[<a id="00-31-28">00:31:28</a>]  This is not just something that happened in the '70s.

[<a id="00-31-31">00:31:31</a>]  Germany and Turkey have relationships

[<a id="00-31-35">00:31:35</a>]  that go back to the 1800s.

[<a id="00-31-37">00:31:37</a>]  - Wait, World War I, II.

[<a id="00-31-40">00:31:40</a>]  - And also before as well.

[<a id="00-31-42">00:31:42</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-31-43">00:31:43</a>]  - The Polish are basically Germans.

[<a id="00-31-45">00:31:45</a>]  - Oh, no, don't say that.

[<a id="00-31-48">00:31:48</a>]  You're going to get so murdered.

[<a id="00-31-50">00:31:50</a>]  You're going to get so murdered.

[<a id="00-31-52">00:31:52</a>]  - I'm talking, but I'm half English, so I don't give a fuck.

[<a id="00-31-56">00:31:56</a>]  - So when you're saying September 1, 1939,

[<a id="00-31-59">00:31:59</a>]  Germany was just visiting their homeland.

[<a id="00-32-01">00:32:01</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

[<a id="00-32-02">00:32:02</a>]  - I mean, the thing is, if you go back to the Prussian Empire and stuff.

[<a id="00-32-07">00:32:07</a>]  - A couple of weeks ago, there was massive floods in Poland, right?

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  And Donald Tusk basically did the--

[<a id="00-32-14">00:32:14</a>]  - I don't know who that is.

[<a id="00-32-15">00:32:15</a>]  - He's the prime minister, and he was basically--

[<a id="00-32-19">00:32:19</a>]  So a lot of European countries were helping out

[<a id="00-32-22">00:32:22</a>]  because it was devastating floods in Poland.

[<a id="00-32-25">00:32:25</a>]  And he does a TV announcement and says,

[<a id="00-32-28">00:32:28</a>]  "Ladies and gentlemen, you will see military from Germany in the streets.

[<a id="00-32-34">00:32:34</a>]  This is on purpose."

[<a id="00-32-39">00:32:39</a>]  But the thing is, I mean, okay, there's a few details,

[<a id="00-32-42">00:32:42</a>]  but genetically, there's a lot of overlap between Poland and Germany.

[<a id="00-32-47">00:32:47</a>]  - But Polish are Slavic people, right?

[<a id="00-32-50">00:32:50</a>]  - Well, it's been hidden back and forth

[<a id="00-32-52">00:32:52</a>]  between the Russians and the Germans for many--

[<a id="00-32-55">00:32:55</a>]  The thing is, what I'm trying to say is--

[<a id="00-32-58">00:32:58</a>]  - You dig that hole for yourself.

[<a id="00-32-59">00:32:59</a>]  - Is that German genetics get shit done.

[<a id="00-33-02">00:33:02</a>]  The problem is that actual Germany has spent the last 80 years

[<a id="00-33-06">00:33:06</a>]  making themselves depressed about what they did in the war.

[<a id="00-33-09">00:33:09</a>]  So they don't do any work anymore.

[<a id="00-33-11">00:33:11</a>]  But the Polish people, they don't feel bad about the war.

[<a id="00-33-14">00:33:14</a>]  So they're like--

[<a id="00-33-15">00:33:15</a>]  - Why would they feel bad? They're the victims.

[<a id="00-33-16">00:33:16</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="00-33-17">00:33:17</a>]  - From both sides.

[<a id="00-33-18">00:33:18</a>]  They got shafted from both sides, basically.

[<a id="00-33-20">00:33:20</a>]  - And they're like, "We gotta do some shit here."

[<a id="00-33-22">00:33:22</a>]  So those guys have motivation.

[<a id="00-33-24">00:33:24</a>]  I have a good Polish colleague--

[<a id="00-33-26">00:33:26</a>]  - I forgot, what is your background?

[<a id="00-33-27">00:33:27</a>]  You're English or more German?

[<a id="00-33-30">00:33:30</a>]  - I grew up in England, but the thing is--

[<a id="00-33-32">00:33:32</a>]  - Your mother's German, right?

[<a id="00-33-34">00:33:34</a>]  - She's English. My dad was German.

[<a id="00-33-36">00:33:36</a>]  - I see.

[<a id="00-33-37">00:33:37</a>]  - But the thing is, growing up in England,

[<a id="00-33-40">00:33:40</a>]  a classic thing is you're on a railway station,

[<a id="00-33-43">00:33:43</a>]  and it goes, "British Rail would like to apologize.

[<a id="00-33-46">00:33:46</a>]  The train will arrive in 300 years."

[<a id="00-33-49">00:33:49</a>]  And then fucking everybody on the platform's like, "Ugh!"

[<a id="00-33-52">00:33:52</a>]  You have these weird moments of English intimacy

[<a id="00-33-54">00:33:54</a>]  where you go, "I know, mate."

[<a id="00-33-55">00:33:55</a>]  And then you look at your feet 'cause it's too much.

[<a id="00-33-57">00:33:57</a>]  But then, and for me, I'm just watching this shit,

[<a id="00-34-00">00:34:00</a>]  and this weird feeling would come up

[<a id="00-34-02">00:34:02</a>]  'cause I have German genetics.

[<a id="00-34-04">00:34:04</a>]  We could fucking fix this shit.

[<a id="00-34-06">00:34:06</a>]  Like, why is nobody fucking doing anything?

[<a id="00-34-10">00:34:10</a>]  And that's England.

[<a id="00-34-11">00:34:11</a>]  Everyone's just, "Mmm, yeah, that's how it is."

[<a id="00-34-14">00:34:14</a>]  And with German genetics, it's a crazy thing.

[<a id="00-34-18">00:34:18</a>]  - Yeah, I was telling you about my acting teacher, Mariana,

[<a id="00-34-22">00:34:22</a>]  the one who was in The Godfather 2.

[<a id="00-34-24">00:34:24</a>]  She had German genetics as well.

[<a id="00-34-26">00:34:26</a>]  She said the same thing.

[<a id="00-34-27">00:34:27</a>]  It's like this weird,

[<a id="00-34-28">00:34:28</a>]  it's like being permanently on 10 espressos.

[<a id="00-34-32">00:34:32</a>]  You just have...

[<a id="00-34-33">00:34:33</a>]  - She played Fredo's wife, right?

[<a id="00-34-35">00:34:35</a>]  - She played Fredo's wife.

[<a id="00-34-36">00:34:36</a>]  And she got raped by Clint Eastwood.

[<a id="00-34-40">00:34:40</a>]  - Fucking hell.

[<a id="00-34-41">00:34:41</a>]  - That was the highlight of her acting career.

[<a id="00-34-44">00:34:44</a>]  - Being raped by Clint Eastwood.

[<a id="00-34-46">00:34:46</a>]  The movie, it had two names.

[<a id="00-34-48">00:34:48</a>]  It was called Paint the Town Red at one point

[<a id="00-34-50">00:34:50</a>]  where he comes back as this ghost after the villagers kill him

[<a id="00-34-55">00:34:55</a>]  and then extracts revenge, including raping my ass.

[<a id="00-34-58">00:34:58</a>]  - This is a so far been interesting episode.

[<a id="00-35-00">00:35:00</a>]  It went from my bombing to a fucking fire in LA

[<a id="00-35-04">00:35:04</a>]  to this lady's rape.

[<a id="00-35-06">00:35:06</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-35-07">00:35:07</a>]  And it's throwing in a little bit of genetics.

[<a id="00-35-10">00:35:10</a>]  - A bit of genetics.

[<a id="00-35-11">00:35:11</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-35-12">00:35:12</a>]  - Yeah, why not?

[<a id="00-35-13">00:35:13</a>]  Okay, so in Ukraine, what else did...

[<a id="00-35-16">00:35:16</a>]  What's the vibe in the place?

[<a id="00-35-18">00:35:18</a>]  What did you get out of being there?

[<a id="00-35-22">00:35:22</a>]  - I mean, it's just like a regular normal European city,

[<a id="00-35-25">00:35:25</a>]  in my opinion, and nobody...

[<a id="00-35-26">00:35:26</a>]  - With a bunch of bombed out tanks.

[<a id="00-35-28">00:35:28</a>]  - Well, that's one plaza, but...

[<a id="00-35-33">00:35:33</a>]  I mean, they claimed there was a bombing nearby the hostel

[<a id="00-35-38">00:35:38</a>]  but I passed out because I drank a little,

[<a id="00-35-40">00:35:40</a>]  so I didn't hear it.

[<a id="00-35-42">00:35:42</a>]  But I've been to other war-torn places

[<a id="00-35-46">00:35:46</a>]  and it looks nothing like what I thought it was going to look like.

[<a id="00-35-48">00:35:48</a>]  It looks like normal.

[<a id="00-35-50">00:35:50</a>]  - So stuff is still running, like people go to work.

[<a id="00-35-54">00:35:54</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, I knew I wasn't going to be in danger

[<a id="00-35-58">00:35:58</a>]  because, I mean, once again, two reasons.

[<a id="00-36-00">00:36:00</a>]  One, I wasn't worried...

[<a id="00-36-02">00:36:02</a>]  - You're a Korean.

[<a id="00-36-03">00:36:03</a>]  - Well, I wasn't worried entering the country

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  because plenty of my six worker friends said,

[<a id="00-36-08">00:36:08</a>]  "Well, take a bus, there's no issue."

[<a id="00-36-10">00:36:10</a>]  And there's plenty of strip clubs running 24/7 almost in Kiev.

[<a id="00-36-17">00:36:17</a>]  So if you have something like...

[<a id="00-36-18">00:36:18</a>]  It's not essential to have sex work, but it's running fine,

[<a id="00-36-22">00:36:22</a>]  then that tells me that the city is running semi-normal or normal.

[<a id="00-36-27">00:36:27</a>]  A couple of things did...

[<a id="00-36-29">00:36:29</a>]  - You think that is a proxy?

[<a id="00-36-30">00:36:30</a>]  - I don't know.

[<a id="00-36-31">00:36:31</a>]  - As long as the sex workers are working, there is...

[<a id="00-36-34">00:36:34</a>]  - I would have thought that, yeah, that could be a bad indicator

[<a id="00-36-37">00:36:37</a>]  because it's like war, soldiers,

[<a id="00-36-40">00:36:40</a>]  horny, single teenage boys, basically.

[<a id="00-36-43">00:36:43</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  - There's a need of it, but if they have a website

[<a id="00-36-47">00:36:47</a>]  and all the clubs are running fine...

[<a id="00-36-49">00:36:49</a>]  - Okay, yeah.

[<a id="00-36-52">00:36:52</a>]  - I wish that the lady who checked me, you know,

[<a id="00-36-54">00:36:54</a>]  when I checked in at the youth hostel, told me two things that she knew,

[<a id="00-36-57">00:36:57</a>]  which is that she was supposed to tell me where the shelters,

[<a id="00-37-00">00:37:00</a>]  in case there's a heavy bombing starts.

[<a id="00-37-02">00:37:02</a>]  And two, there's a curfew at midnight, which I didn't know.

[<a id="00-37-05">00:37:05</a>]  So when he told me, like, I ran to my youth hostel,

[<a id="00-37-08">00:37:08</a>]  I barely made it in, like, I had, like,

[<a id="00-37-10">00:37:10</a>]  eight minutes before it would be midnight, you know.

[<a id="00-37-12">00:37:12</a>]  - Wait, so the whole city, there's a curfew at midnight?

[<a id="00-37-15">00:37:15</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-37-16">00:37:16</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-37-17">00:37:17</a>]  - Now, the trick is, he did say,

[<a id="00-37-19">00:37:19</a>]  but if you need to be out and stay up all night,

[<a id="00-37-22">00:37:22</a>]  you could go to strip club, but once you go in,

[<a id="00-37-24">00:37:24</a>]  you have to wait until five in the morning.

[<a id="00-37-26">00:37:26</a>]  - Oh.

[<a id="00-37-28">00:37:28</a>]  - So it was, I think he told me, like, midnight to five a.m.,

[<a id="00-37-30">00:37:30</a>]  you can't have, like, walking around the city

[<a id="00-37-32">00:37:32</a>]  or something like that.

[<a id="00-37-34">00:37:34</a>]  And what was another weird thing was,

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  we went to the grocery store, Vassar and I,

[<a id="00-37-39">00:37:39</a>]  and I'm trying to buy whiskey or something.

[<a id="00-37-42">00:37:42</a>]  It was so cheap because U.S. currencies are, like,

[<a id="00-37-45">00:37:45</a>]  60% stronger than what it was last time I was there.

[<a id="00-37-49">00:37:49</a>]  And I keep scanning the fucking den, it won't let me charge.

[<a id="00-37-52">00:37:52</a>]  And then he told me a couple hours later,

[<a id="00-37-54">00:37:54</a>]  oh, you can only buy alcohol until 10 p.m. at night.

[<a id="00-37-58">00:37:58</a>]  So it was, like, 10, 10.30.

[<a id="00-38-00">00:38:00</a>]  So every time I was scanning, it won't let me go through.

[<a id="00-38-03">00:38:03</a>]  And I thought, 10 p.m., like, if it's midnight,

[<a id="00-38-06">00:38:06</a>]  why can't you buy until, like, 11.30 or something, you know?

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  But even the guy working at the grocery store

[<a id="00-38-11">00:38:11</a>]  couldn't figure out why you couldn't scan it.

[<a id="00-38-13">00:38:13</a>]  Like, yeah, because you can only buy alcohol until 10 p.m.

[<a id="00-38-15">00:38:15</a>]  - The computer switches off the booths.

[<a id="00-38-17">00:38:17</a>]  - Yeah, so that was another thing.

[<a id="00-38-19">00:38:19</a>]  But I've been there before, so I walked around.

[<a id="00-38-22">00:38:22</a>]  Where I was staying, I was very familiar,

[<a id="00-38-24">00:38:24</a>]  but when I was walking to the youth house,

[<a id="00-38-26">00:38:26</a>]  I was at the part of Kiev that I've never been before,

[<a id="00-38-29">00:38:29</a>]  so I was a little lost, but thank God for Poland and Ukraine.

[<a id="00-38-36">00:38:36</a>]  Both times, KFC saved my ass, you know?

[<a id="00-38-39">00:38:39</a>]  KFC became my unofficial embassy

[<a id="00-38-42">00:38:42</a>]  because they have Wi-Fi available,

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  so you could figure out where you were at.

[<a id="00-38-47">00:38:47</a>]  You could pay anything with a credit card,

[<a id="00-38-49">00:38:49</a>]  and people were very friendly.

[<a id="00-38-51">00:38:51</a>]  So even Modova, I think the QFC--

[<a id="00-38-53">00:38:53</a>]  I don't know, for some reason,

[<a id="00-38-55">00:38:55</a>]  KFC was the most convenient place to go,

[<a id="00-38-57">00:38:57</a>]  to stay if I didn't have a place to stay, and it was cheap.

[<a id="00-39-00">00:39:00</a>]  - Wait, and the food is okay?

[<a id="00-39-02">00:39:02</a>]  Did you have any?

[<a id="00-39-04">00:39:04</a>]  - Of course, I bought something.

[<a id="00-39-05">00:39:05</a>]  I ate, and there were healthier versions

[<a id="00-39-08">00:39:08</a>]  of what I'm used to in America.

[<a id="00-39-10">00:39:10</a>]  - Yeah, that's what I thought.

[<a id="00-39-12">00:39:12</a>]  Healthy KFC--

[<a id="00-39-13">00:39:13</a>]  - Not even in a war zone could you do

[<a id="00-39-15">00:39:15</a>]  what you can get away with in America.

[<a id="00-39-17">00:39:17</a>]  - Yeah, because somebody asked me, like,

[<a id="00-39-21">00:39:21</a>]  "As American, do you feel weird about attack

[<a id="00-39-24">00:39:24</a>]  on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?"

[<a id="00-39-27">00:39:27</a>]  Because now you join a different team,

[<a id="00-39-30">00:39:30</a>]  the winning team that dropped bombs or whatever,

[<a id="00-39-32">00:39:32</a>]  but those things never bothered me.

[<a id="00-39-35">00:39:35</a>]  You know what bothers me?

[<a id="00-39-36">00:39:36</a>]  When there's Americans send their KFC,

[<a id="00-39-39">00:39:39</a>]  McDonald's, and Burger King to Japan

[<a id="00-39-41">00:39:41</a>]  because that killed more people than nukes every day.

[<a id="00-39-44">00:39:44</a>]  Those fast food has killed more Japanese than Hiroshima.

[<a id="00-39-47">00:39:47</a>]  Really, I don't--

[<a id="00-39-48">00:39:48</a>]  - I know what you're saying.

[<a id="00-39-49">00:39:49</a>]  - It is true.

[<a id="00-39-50">00:39:50</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-39-53">00:39:53</a>]  Because they're delicious.

[<a id="00-39-54">00:39:54</a>]  It's not going to kill you.

[<a id="00-39-56">00:39:56</a>]  But too many Americans--

[<a id="00-39-58">00:39:58</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-39-59">00:39:59</a>]  - You know, you miss something

[<a id="00-40-01">00:40:01</a>]  because not only Christian's an incredible host,

[<a id="00-40-04">00:40:04</a>]  but he was giving me a plan what dinner's going to be,

[<a id="00-40-07">00:40:07</a>]  and he gave me ingredients, what we're going to eat,

[<a id="00-40-09">00:40:09</a>]  how he's going to prepare and things like that.

[<a id="00-40-12">00:40:12</a>]  And I wasn't being sarcastic, but I told him

[<a id="00-40-14">00:40:14</a>]  that's a very French thing that he's doing

[<a id="00-40-17">00:40:17</a>]  because Japan and France, many of the schools,

[<a id="00-40-20">00:40:20</a>]  beginning of the week will say,

[<a id="00-40-22">00:40:22</a>]  what are we going to eat for the week, a preparation meal,

[<a id="00-40-25">00:40:25</a>]  because there's reverence for food, right?

[<a id="00-40-28">00:40:28</a>]  We should be thankful for food.

[<a id="00-40-30">00:40:30</a>]  In Japan, they train kids to serve food

[<a id="00-40-32">00:40:32</a>]  so they understand connection, like how they're made.

[<a id="00-40-35">00:40:35</a>]  And then we also do the cleanup.

[<a id="00-40-37">00:40:37</a>]  So you have a little bit more respect to the kitchen

[<a id="00-40-39">00:40:39</a>]  and what you've done and things like that.

[<a id="00-40-41">00:40:41</a>]  And I think--

[<a id="00-40-43">00:40:43</a>]  - And portion control.

[<a id="00-40-45">00:40:45</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-40-46">00:40:46</a>]  - I'm super fascinated with--

[<a id="00-40-49">00:40:49</a>]  I think it was one of the restaurants here in Zurich

[<a id="00-40-54">00:40:54</a>]  is run by a Japanese family,

[<a id="00-40-56">00:40:56</a>]  and they do basically a school lunch in Seffelt,

[<a id="00-41-02">00:41:02</a>]  and it's these bento boxes, basically, that's what it is.

[<a id="00-41-06">00:41:06</a>]  And it's like, all right, this is what you would get

[<a id="00-41-08">00:41:08</a>]  when you're in Japanese school.

[<a id="00-41-11">00:41:11</a>]  And you would be provided decent food,

[<a id="00-41-14">00:41:14</a>]  and it would always contain veggies,

[<a id="00-41-18">00:41:18</a>]  it would always contain decent protein and decent carbs.

[<a id="00-41-22">00:41:22</a>]  Like, no hot dogs.

[<a id="00-41-25">00:41:25</a>]  - You know, it's funny, actually,

[<a id="00-41-27">00:41:27</a>]  also when my kids were at kindergarten here,

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  one time they'd bring back some of these sheets.

[<a id="00-41-33">00:41:33</a>]  They had this poster of good and evil,

[<a id="00-41-38">00:41:38</a>]  and on the good was like, what to eat in the morning,

[<a id="00-41-41">00:41:41</a>]  for example, carrots, apples, this kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-41-44">00:41:44</a>]  Cheese.

[<a id="00-41-45">00:41:45</a>]  Evil, it had Coca-Cola.

[<a id="00-41-47">00:41:47</a>]  Like, you had all the kind of shit you shouldn't eat.

[<a id="00-41-50">00:41:50</a>]  And it just got me thinking about, you know,

[<a id="00-41-54">00:41:54</a>]  you've got Coke vending machines in schools in America.

[<a id="00-41-58">00:41:58</a>]  Like, that would be so illegal now in Switzerland.

[<a id="00-42-01">00:42:01</a>]  Yeah, you could never do that stuff here.

[<a id="00-42-03">00:42:03</a>]  - I think that's why, what's his name?

[<a id="00-42-10">00:42:10</a>]  Luigi Mangini, this kid that shot the CEO.

[<a id="00-42-13">00:42:13</a>]  - Was he drinking too much Coca-Cola?

[<a id="00-42-15">00:42:15</a>]  - No, no, no.

[<a id="00-42-17">00:42:17</a>]  I understand the frustration with the U.S. health care,

[<a id="00-42-20">00:42:20</a>]  but believe me, most Americans do themselves no favor

[<a id="00-42-23">00:42:23</a>]  by eating the kind of food they're eating,

[<a id="00-42-26">00:42:26</a>]  lack of exercise and things like that.

[<a id="00-42-28">00:42:28</a>]  I think that probably do the biggest harm

[<a id="00-42-31">00:42:31</a>]  to most American health.

[<a id="00-42-35">00:42:35</a>]  Because whenever people say that we should help this cause

[<a id="00-42-40">00:42:40</a>]  and this and that, but like, I just think,

[<a id="00-42-43">00:42:43</a>]  what is the top ten killer of humanity?

[<a id="00-42-46">00:42:46</a>]  Like, heart disease, cancer, you know.

[<a id="00-42-49">00:42:49</a>]  It's just like, everything related to like,

[<a id="00-42-51">00:42:51</a>]  poor diet, lack of exercise and things like that.

[<a id="00-42-54">00:42:54</a>]  - When were you in the States last, Harry?

[<a id="00-42-57">00:42:57</a>]  - Let's come back a bit.

[<a id="00-43-00">00:43:00</a>]  Last time was Los Angeles, but 2016 maybe.

[<a id="00-43-08">00:43:08</a>]  What baffled me when we were in Memphis together,

[<a id="00-43-12">00:43:12</a>]  and I don't think it was in Memphis.

[<a id="00-43-14">00:43:14</a>]  - It's one of the worst place for food, but go ahead.

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  - Exactly, but we went for barbecue.

[<a id="00-43-20">00:43:20</a>]  - Yes, I quite remember that time.

[<a id="00-43-25">00:43:25</a>]  - And I will never forget, like, it's something

[<a id="00-43-29">00:43:29</a>]  that I've experienced before in the States.

[<a id="00-43-31">00:43:31</a>]  Bread never tastes like bread.

[<a id="00-43-34">00:43:34</a>]  Whenever you get bread, it's not even brioche.

[<a id="00-43-38">00:43:38</a>]  - Wait, what was that word you just used?

[<a id="00-43-42">00:43:42</a>]  - Brioche bun, like a buttery bun.

[<a id="00-43-46">00:43:46</a>]  - Wow, fancy guy here.

[<a id="00-43-48">00:43:48</a>]  - No, no, no, but this is how it looks.

[<a id="00-43-51">00:43:51</a>]  It looks like a brioche bun, but it's not.

[<a id="00-43-54">00:43:54</a>]  It's a slab of butter.

[<a id="00-43-57">00:43:57</a>]  Like, literally, it's a slab of butter and sugar.

[<a id="00-44-00">00:44:00</a>]  It's sweet, it's very palatable, it's fucking amazing.

[<a id="00-44-03">00:44:03</a>]  Like, the flavors are insane.

[<a id="00-44-05">00:44:05</a>]  But, you know, like, oh, this is gonna fuck me up.

[<a id="00-44-08">00:44:08</a>]  Like, this piece of bread is fucking me up

[<a id="00-44-11">00:44:11</a>]  more than the steak that I'm having next.

[<a id="00-44-14">00:44:14</a>]  And it is something that I've only experienced in the States

[<a id="00-44-18">00:44:18</a>]  where you can't trust the bread.

[<a id="00-44-20">00:44:20</a>]  The bread is always a lie.

[<a id="00-44-22">00:44:22</a>]  - I think there's some connection here.

[<a id="00-44-27">00:44:27</a>]  When I explain to my poor friends in Europe,

[<a id="00-44-30">00:44:30</a>]  especially in Eastern Europe, they cannot believe

[<a id="00-44-33">00:44:33</a>]  the amount of wealth in America.

[<a id="00-44-37">00:44:37</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-44-38">00:44:38</a>]  - And part of the reason why there's so much wealth in America

[<a id="00-44-42">00:44:42</a>]  because the system, the way the system's set up,

[<a id="00-44-46">00:44:46</a>]  it rewards if you have a good service that people want, obviously.

[<a id="00-44-51">00:44:51</a>]  - Of course.

[<a id="00-44-52">00:44:52</a>]  - And insurance service is no longer--

[<a id="00-44-56">00:44:56</a>]  it's about providing insurance to help people with better health care.

[<a id="00-45-02">00:45:02</a>]  It's motivated by profit.

[<a id="00-45-03">00:45:03</a>]  And believe me, I have nothing against profit either.

[<a id="00-45-07">00:45:07</a>]  Pharmaceutical business are based on, you know,

[<a id="00-45-11">00:45:11</a>]  you put a little bit of terror into people that you might get old

[<a id="00-45-14">00:45:14</a>]  if you don't have these pills, you know.

[<a id="00-45-17">00:45:17</a>]  But food, man, I think the same people that make amazing addictive drugs,

[<a id="00-45-22">00:45:22</a>]  these are the same kind of people making the food science--

[<a id="00-45-24">00:45:24</a>]  - A hundred percent.

[<a id="00-45-25">00:45:25</a>]  - I don't know what you call it.

[<a id="00-45-26">00:45:26</a>]  Is it food science?

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  I don't know what you call it.

[<a id="00-45-28">00:45:28</a>]  But because this taste, man, it's--

[<a id="00-45-32">00:45:32</a>]  - As soon as you buy food that has more than two ingredients,

[<a id="00-45-36">00:45:36</a>]  it's food science.

[<a id="00-45-37">00:45:37</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-45-38">00:45:38</a>]  - It's making like fucking corn flakes.

[<a id="00-45-41">00:45:41</a>]  That's where it starts, like all the fucking dog shit that's in there.

[<a id="00-45-47">00:45:47</a>]  Not the plain vanilla ones, but they're already bad for you.

[<a id="00-45-51">00:45:51</a>]  But the fucking sugar coating, like what are they called?

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  Frosties or whatever?

[<a id="00-45-56">00:45:56</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-45-57">00:45:57</a>]  - It starts and then it goes to fucking Froot Loops and you're--

[<a id="00-46-00">00:46:00</a>]  - But I think this is a problem with the interpretation

[<a id="00-46-05">00:46:05</a>]  of the pursuit of happiness.

[<a id="00-46-07">00:46:07</a>]  Because to me, it's been interpreted in the U.S.

[<a id="00-46-11">00:46:11</a>]  as the pursuit of short-term happiness or instant gratification.

[<a id="00-46-16">00:46:16</a>]  And that's not how to be happy.

[<a id="00-46-19">00:46:19</a>]  That's like short-term ah to long-term debt or miserable life.

[<a id="00-46-25">00:46:25</a>]  - But long-term debt is applicable for all of us, isn't it?

[<a id="00-46-28">00:46:28</a>]  - Sure, but it's just--

[<a id="00-46-29">00:46:29</a>]  - It's just escalating.

[<a id="00-46-31">00:46:31</a>]  - I mean, there's being dead at the end of it

[<a id="00-46-36">00:46:36</a>]  and then there's being dead for half your life

[<a id="00-46-38">00:46:38</a>]  because you fucked your body with the junk you put in in the first half.

[<a id="00-46-42">00:46:42</a>]  - I only know one country in the whole world

[<a id="00-46-46">00:46:46</a>]  where we have this notion where life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness--

[<a id="00-46-51">00:46:51</a>]  not guaranteed happiness, but you have right to pursue it.

[<a id="00-46-55">00:46:55</a>]  No other country can advertise that notion.

[<a id="00-46-58">00:46:58</a>]  So we're obsessed with the idea of happiness.

[<a id="00-47-01">00:47:01</a>]  And the problem is even people who are happy,

[<a id="00-47-04">00:47:04</a>]  sometimes they don't know they're happy.

[<a id="00-47-07">00:47:07</a>]  Maybe they realize that after the fact.

[<a id="00-47-09">00:47:09</a>]  But we have a place called Madison Avenue in New York City,

[<a id="00-47-13">00:47:13</a>]  and their idea is always to remind you that,

[<a id="00-47-16">00:47:16</a>]  "No, you're actually not that happy.

[<a id="00-47-18">00:47:18</a>]  Let us help you happiness."

[<a id="00-47-21">00:47:21</a>]  - Fucking madmen.

[<a id="00-47-22">00:47:22</a>]  - These are the things that you need to purchase,

[<a id="00-47-24">00:47:24</a>]  or these are the services you need to get.

[<a id="00-47-26">00:47:26</a>]  So I think, you know, I've been to Afghanistan three times

[<a id="00-47-33">00:47:33</a>]  and I've met so many people so little,

[<a id="00-47-36">00:47:36</a>]  but I've got to admit they seem to have a very close-knit family relationship.

[<a id="00-47-41">00:47:41</a>]  And once again, like my friend Hatham said,

[<a id="00-47-43">00:47:43</a>]  "Yoshi, I live in a failed state,

[<a id="00-47-47">00:47:47</a>]  but I don't have to make an appointment to have dinner with my family."

[<a id="00-47-50">00:47:50</a>]  And it does seem like...

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  - Especially if you're a young boy in Afghanistan.

[<a id="00-47-56">00:47:56</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-47-57">00:47:57</a>]  - You can always get access to a family.

[<a id="00-48-02">00:48:02</a>]  - But I think that's the problem, isn't it?

[<a id="00-48-04">00:48:04</a>]  It's just that happiness is an important thing.

[<a id="00-48-10">00:48:10</a>]  But I mean, my problem is like sometimes looking back,

[<a id="00-48-13">00:48:13</a>]  "Oh, I guess I was happy, I didn't even realize at that time."

[<a id="00-48-17">00:48:17</a>]  And I live in a new country where life is living in pursuit of happiness,

[<a id="00-48-22">00:48:22</a>]  so I think it's hard to be grateful, you know?

[<a id="00-48-26">00:48:26</a>]  - It's when happiness becomes quantifiable.

[<a id="00-48-29">00:48:29</a>]  - Is it quantifiable?

[<a id="00-48-31">00:48:31</a>]  - No, it is not. I don't think it is.

[<a id="00-48-34">00:48:34</a>]  - But we have a system where it seems like it's quantifiable.

[<a id="00-48-37">00:48:37</a>]  - It's suggested that it is, and the quantifier is monetary.

[<a id="00-48-42">00:48:42</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-48-43">00:48:43</a>]  - So people just go by like, "I have to be rich, that means I'm happy."

[<a id="00-48-48">00:48:48</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-49">00:48:49</a>]  - And then you talk to someone who always chased the dream of being rich,

[<a id="00-48-52">00:48:52</a>]  becoming rich, never being happy either.

[<a id="00-48-54">00:48:54</a>]  - Yeah, it's because, I mean, mostly, if you can...

[<a id="00-48-59">00:48:59</a>]  I feel like most of the mess begins with just everyone trying to...

[<a id="00-49-04">00:49:04</a>]  It's not about how much you have, it's about having more than someone else

[<a id="00-49-10">00:49:10</a>]  that you project that onto.

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  So if you're...

[<a id="00-49-14">00:49:14</a>]  - Jealousy?

[<a id="00-49-15">00:49:15</a>]  - If you're an attractive woman, but you see a super attractive woman,

[<a id="00-49-19">00:49:19</a>]  you've now got to go and buy some stupid beauty products that you don't need.

[<a id="00-49-23">00:49:23</a>]  Or whatever it is, we're like that.

[<a id="00-49-26">00:49:26</a>]  And the moment you check out from trying to compete with everyone,

[<a id="00-49-30">00:49:30</a>]  you suddenly don't need half the shit that you have.

[<a id="00-49-33">00:49:33</a>]  - Have you checked out from competing with everyone?

[<a id="00-49-36">00:49:36</a>]  - I just get angry with everyone.

[<a id="00-49-38">00:49:38</a>]  That's, you know, but that's more cathartic.

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  Like, I just...

[<a id="00-49-45">00:49:45</a>]  Because what happens, I don't know...

[<a id="00-49-47">00:49:47</a>]  - Harry has the right to pursue anger.

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  - The pursuit of being pissed off at people.

[<a id="00-49-51">00:49:51</a>]  Because the thing is, you must get to this at a certain point in your life, Yoshi,

[<a id="00-49-57">00:49:57</a>]  is you see the bullshit people are doing that they think they're being so sneaky about.

[<a id="00-50-02">00:50:02</a>]  And at a certain point, you're just like...

[<a id="00-50-04">00:50:04</a>]  - No, no, but it's bullshit, I'm doing it too.

[<a id="00-50-07">00:50:07</a>]  Sometimes I catch myself like, "Wait, why did I do that?"

[<a id="00-50-10">00:50:10</a>]  I look back, you know, and...

[<a id="00-50-12">00:50:12</a>]  - Yeah, and it's...

[<a id="00-50-15">00:50:15</a>]  Sometimes I meet someone who's like late 20s, early 30s,

[<a id="00-50-19">00:50:19</a>]  and I can see them doing some shit where they think this,

[<a id="00-50-22">00:50:22</a>]  "I'm so cunningly manipulating the thing to get what I want,"

[<a id="00-50-26">00:50:26</a>]  or whatever they're doing.

[<a id="00-50-28">00:50:28</a>]  And you just...

[<a id="00-50-30">00:50:30</a>]  And often, you can't tell anybody anything.

[<a id="00-50-35">00:50:35</a>]  So it's just this descent into retardedness.

[<a id="00-50-38">00:50:38</a>]  I think the answer to a lot of this, so this is where I get just annoyed with people,

[<a id="00-50-42">00:50:42</a>]  is if there was an instant negative feedback response system,

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  so you do some bullshit, you get electrocuted,

[<a id="00-50-52">00:50:52</a>]  we could fix a lot of the shit on the planet.

[<a id="00-50-55">00:50:55</a>]  - You sound like the Chinese,

[<a id="00-50-58">00:50:58</a>]  because they have a social scoring thing that they're monitoring people all the time.

[<a id="00-51-02">00:51:02</a>]  - Yeah, I think, you know, if your phone just zaps you...

[<a id="00-51-05">00:51:05</a>]  - Okay, that's the German side speaking.

[<a id="00-51-07">00:51:07</a>]  - You talk shit to someone.

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  I know, it's the lack of whiskey speaking.

[<a id="00-51-12">00:51:12</a>]  I have no empathy right now.

[<a id="00-51-14">00:51:14</a>]  I'm feeling too good about myself.

[<a id="00-51-17">00:51:17</a>]  - So whilst you were in Kiev,

[<a id="00-51-22">00:51:22</a>]  Switzerland moved forward with its plans and society and had some great ideas.

[<a id="00-51-28">00:51:28</a>]  One of my favorite things that happened on the 2nd of January,

[<a id="00-51-32">00:51:32</a>]  just so you know, I want you to know...

[<a id="00-51-34">00:51:34</a>]  - Is this the Burka thing or is that France?

[<a id="00-51-36">00:51:36</a>]  - No, it's way more important.

[<a id="00-51-38">00:51:38</a>]  Switzerland voted for the fish of the year on the 2nd of February.

[<a id="00-51-44">00:51:44</a>]  - Is it generic or an individual fish?

[<a id="00-51-47">00:51:47</a>]  - No, it's a sander.

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  - One single...

[<a id="00-51-50">00:51:50</a>]  - One single fish.

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  - Wait, they do this every year?

[<a id="00-51-52">00:51:52</a>]  - Every year.

[<a id="00-51-55">00:51:55</a>]  And they only choose landlocked fish.

[<a id="00-52-00">00:52:00</a>]  But this is my favorite thing.

[<a id="00-52-04">00:52:04</a>]  I woke up the day after New Year's,

[<a id="00-52-10">00:52:10</a>]  still kind of groggy from...

[<a id="00-52-14">00:52:14</a>]  It wasn't a wild night, but alcohol was consumed for quite a bit.

[<a id="00-52-19">00:52:19</a>]  And I wake up to the news that the Swiss Fisheries Association

[<a id="00-52-24">00:52:24</a>]  has made the effort to distribute this information

[<a id="00-52-28">00:52:28</a>]  to all the newspapers on the 1st of January,

[<a id="00-52-31">00:52:31</a>]  to be printed on the 2nd,

[<a id="00-52-33">00:52:33</a>]  that they have officially named the fish of the year.

[<a id="00-52-36">00:52:36</a>]  - So what does that mean?

[<a id="00-52-37">00:52:37</a>]  That that fish is something that you're supposed to eat for the year?

[<a id="00-52-40">00:52:40</a>]  - No, no, no.

[<a id="00-52-41">00:52:41</a>]  Does a fish have a name?

[<a id="00-52-44">00:52:44</a>]  - I'm sure it has a Latin name.

[<a id="00-52-46">00:52:46</a>]  - So it has...

[<a id="00-52-47">00:52:47</a>]  Sander lucio perca is the Latin name.

[<a id="00-52-52">00:52:52</a>]  - Oh, so it's an Italian immigrant fish.

[<a id="00-52-55">00:52:55</a>]  - Sorry, Latin is...

[<a id="00-52-56">00:52:56</a>]  Oh, fuck's sake.

[<a id="00-53-00">00:53:00</a>]  I thought you were smart.

[<a id="00-53-02">00:53:02</a>]  - They found it in Lake Tijina.

[<a id="00-53-04">00:53:04</a>]  - The sander is as magnificent as mythical.

[<a id="00-53-09">00:53:09</a>]  Merciless, predatory, night,

[<a id="00-53-12">00:53:12</a>]  and as popular in fishing as it is in the kitchen.

[<a id="00-53-18">00:53:18</a>]  The fishing organization wrote in a press release

[<a id="00-53-21">00:53:21</a>]  Thursday.

[<a id="00-53-23">00:53:23</a>]  - Oh, wait, wait.

[<a id="00-53-24">00:53:24</a>]  But they just killed that sander.

[<a id="00-53-26">00:53:26</a>]  All the sander...

[<a id="00-53-27">00:53:27</a>]  - All the sander are the fish of the year.

[<a id="00-53-29">00:53:29</a>]  - Oh, I thought it was a specific individual fish.

[<a id="00-53-33">00:53:33</a>]  - Oh, you mean the fish chef?

[<a id="00-53-35">00:53:35</a>]  - Yeah, it's like Miss Fisherland or something.

[<a id="00-53-39">00:53:39</a>]  - That's really funny.

[<a id="00-53-42">00:53:42</a>]  - Fisher...

[<a id="00-53-43">00:53:43</a>]  They just named her...

[<a id="00-53-44">00:53:44</a>]  Oh, fuck it.

[<a id="00-53-45">00:53:45</a>]  That's not...

[<a id="00-53-46">00:53:46</a>]  And they do this every year.

[<a id="00-53-47">00:53:47</a>]  - Every year.

[<a id="00-53-48">00:53:48</a>]  - How can you...

[<a id="00-53-49">00:53:49</a>]  - So in 2024 was the Marble Trout.

[<a id="00-53-52">00:53:52</a>]  - Oh, Jesus Christ.

[<a id="00-53-54">00:53:54</a>]  - Yep.

[<a id="00-53-55">00:53:55</a>]  2024 was the Marble Trout.

[<a id="00-53-57">00:53:57</a>]  - A couple of weeks later,

[<a id="00-54-01">00:54:01</a>]  we find that Christian is the president of the association.

[<a id="00-54-04">00:54:04</a>]  - No, seriously.

[<a id="00-54-05">00:54:05</a>]  Like waking up on the 2nd of January

[<a id="00-54-08">00:54:08</a>]  and the world is on fire, literally.

[<a id="00-54-11">00:54:11</a>]  - Not yet, but yeah.

[<a id="00-54-13">00:54:13</a>]  - Some of it.

[<a id="00-54-15">00:54:15</a>]  There's bombs being dropped everywhere

[<a id="00-54-18">00:54:18</a>]  and for me, it was just such a weird thing to see in the newspaper.

[<a id="00-54-23">00:54:23</a>]  Trump said something outrageous.

[<a id="00-54-25">00:54:25</a>]  Fish of the year.

[<a id="00-54-26">00:54:26</a>]  - But the thing is, right, there's only...

[<a id="00-54-29">00:54:29</a>]  - That just tell you that this country is very safe.

[<a id="00-54-32">00:54:32</a>]  If that's the biggest news...

[<a id="00-54-35">00:54:35</a>]  - It was headlines.

[<a id="00-54-37">00:54:37</a>]  It was headlines.

[<a id="00-54-39">00:54:39</a>]  - How many different species of fish are there in Switzerland?

[<a id="00-54-43">00:54:43</a>]  There's not more than 30.

[<a id="00-54-44">00:54:44</a>]  - Okay, let's ask.

[<a id="00-54-46">00:54:46</a>]  Because this could become the Swiss-Chinese New Year thing.

[<a id="00-54-51">00:54:51</a>]  - How many...

[<a id="00-54-52">00:54:52</a>]  - You know, you got the rat and the goat and the donkey.

[<a id="00-54-55">00:54:55</a>]  - You don't have to tell me.

[<a id="00-54-57">00:54:57</a>]  - We could just have the...

[<a id="00-54-59">00:54:59</a>]  This is the year of the pike.

[<a id="00-55-01">00:55:01</a>]  - There's about 70 native fish species in Switzerland,

[<a id="00-55-05">00:55:05</a>]  but the non-native species reach around 90 to 100 species in total.

[<a id="00-55-11">00:55:11</a>]  - Well, you can be sure they're never going to put a non-native fish.

[<a id="00-55-14">00:55:14</a>]  - Sander is a non-native.

[<a id="00-55-16">00:55:16</a>]  So this is where it becomes political again.

[<a id="00-55-21">00:55:21</a>]  The Sander...

[<a id="00-55-22">00:55:22</a>]  - I already know that you guys are going to edit this part out.

[<a id="00-55-24">00:55:24</a>]  It's a fucking immigrant fish.

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  - The Sander is an immigrant.

[<a id="00-55-27">00:55:27</a>]  He has been around for 60 years though.

[<a id="00-55-31">00:55:31</a>]  So it's kind of like, what are we calling this?

[<a id="00-55-33">00:55:33</a>]  - That fish from another country, is that what you're saying?

[<a id="00-55-35">00:55:35</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-55-36">00:55:36</a>]  It never grew in Switzerland.

[<a id="00-55-38">00:55:38</a>]  It was introduced.

[<a id="00-55-39">00:55:39</a>]  - It's a secundo by now.

[<a id="00-55-40">00:55:40</a>]  - It's a secundo by now.

[<a id="00-55-41">00:55:41</a>]  It's like the third, probably the 17th generation, I guess.

[<a id="00-55-46">00:55:46</a>]  - But this is, I mean, this is like your story of Koreans in Japan,

[<a id="00-55-50">00:55:50</a>]  because you're a second generation of fish.

[<a id="00-55-52">00:55:52</a>]  - Yes, we're a fucking filthy fish.

[<a id="00-55-55">00:55:55</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-55-58">00:55:58</a>]  Stinky fish.

[<a id="00-55-59">00:55:59</a>]  - And also, is there like a discount Sander sushi list?

[<a id="00-56-05">00:56:05</a>]  - No.

[<a id="00-56-06">00:56:06</a>]  So they are basically saying there is not enough Sander,

[<a id="00-56-09">00:56:09</a>]  because people like Sander on their fucking dinner table.

[<a id="00-56-13">00:56:13</a>]  There is not enough Sander.

[<a id="00-56-15">00:56:15</a>]  So why make it the fucking fish of the year when there is not enough of it?

[<a id="00-56-19">00:56:19</a>]  - So that we stop eating them, they can do some fucking, like what?

[<a id="00-56-22">00:56:22</a>]  - They don't fuck, do they?

[<a id="00-56-24">00:56:24</a>]  Do fish fuck?

[<a id="00-56-25">00:56:25</a>]  - They lay eggs and they do...

[<a id="00-56-27">00:56:27</a>]  The fish fuck.

[<a id="00-56-29">00:56:29</a>]  No, I think they lay...

[<a id="00-56-30">00:56:30</a>]  - Dolphins fuck, but they're not fish.

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  - The mum lays some eggs and then they spray some jit.

[<a id="00-56-36">00:56:36</a>]  It's like the coming on your children race.

[<a id="00-56-40">00:56:40</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-56-42">00:56:42</a>]  - Dolphins rate too, by the way.

[<a id="00-56-44">00:56:44</a>]  - They do, yeah.

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  They fuck each other in the blow.

[<a id="00-56-46">00:56:46</a>]  - Maybe you get some dolphins in the Swiss race, go fuck those sanders.

[<a id="00-56-50">00:56:50</a>]  [laughter]

[<a id="00-56-53">00:56:53</a>]  - Oh, man.

[<a id="00-56-54">00:56:54</a>]  I was very proud of my country when I saw this news headline.

[<a id="00-56-58">00:56:58</a>]  - It's beautiful.

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  - The Sander is also a good hunter and travels in packs like wolves.

[<a id="00-57-03">00:57:03</a>]  - Really?

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  Fucking, these are some...

[<a id="00-57-07">00:57:07</a>]  You've got elite fish here.

[<a id="00-57-09">00:57:09</a>]  - This is alpha fish.

[<a id="00-57-11">00:57:11</a>]  - So they're like sea wolves.

[<a id="00-57-13">00:57:13</a>]  - Yeah, that's exactly right.

[<a id="00-57-15">00:57:15</a>]  They have little teeth and shit.

[<a id="00-57-18">00:57:18</a>]  Shall I cook you a sander once you're here?

[<a id="00-57-21">00:57:21</a>]  - That's why you were asking me if I like seafood this morning.

[<a id="00-57-24">00:57:24</a>]  - I'll make sander sashimi for you.

[<a id="00-57-27">00:57:27</a>]  - You know when you had like German U-boats off the coast of New York?

[<a id="00-57-31">00:57:31</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-57-32">00:57:32</a>]  - This is kind of the sander of this.

[<a id="00-57-35">00:57:35</a>]  - This is the official reason why they're doing it.

[<a id="00-57-37">00:57:37</a>]  - I can't believe they keep talking about this.

[<a id="00-57-39">00:57:39</a>]  - Seriously, I have to.

[<a id="00-57-40">00:57:40</a>]  It's so retarded.

[<a id="00-57-41">00:57:41</a>]  The FSP chose the sander as Fish of the Year 2025 as it wants to raise awareness about

[<a id="00-57-47">00:57:47</a>]  natural aquatic habitats to ensure that there are more native fish caught in the wild.

[<a id="00-57-53">00:57:53</a>]  Again, the fucker is not native.

[<a id="00-57-56">00:57:56</a>]  - True.

[<a id="00-57-57">00:57:57</a>]  This is immigrant fish.

[<a id="00-57-58">00:57:58</a>]  How many of these immigrant fish are there?

[<a id="00-58-01">00:58:01</a>]  - Well, according to ChatCPT, about 40 species.

[<a id="00-58-06">00:58:06</a>]  - Yeah, but how many sander, like rough population?

[<a id="00-58-10">00:58:10</a>]  - Not enough, that's all I know.

[<a id="00-58-13">00:58:13</a>]  I'm not part of the FSP.

[<a id="00-58-15">00:58:15</a>]  - We can put up a dam and stop the immigrant fish.

[<a id="00-58-18">00:58:18</a>]  - Stop the immigrant fish.

[<a id="00-58-19">00:58:19</a>]  - I forgot the name of the fish now that you reminded me.

[<a id="00-58-21">00:58:21</a>]  In Florida, some asshole brought this predatory fish from Asia, maybe China or something.

[<a id="00-58-27">00:58:27</a>]  And these motherfuckers is so creepy, they're able to literally almost like walk on their

[<a id="00-58-33">00:58:33</a>]  fence and like over land because they show a clip where they're going through the mud

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  going across to other side of the lake.

[<a id="00-58-41">00:58:41</a>]  - No, fuck off.

[<a id="00-58-43">00:58:43</a>]  - Yeah, and they have these like just filthy mouth with this.

[<a id="00-58-48">00:58:48</a>]  - Kind of a catfish, sounds like.

[<a id="00-58-50">00:58:50</a>]  - It kind of looked like, but these motherfuckers are like...

[<a id="00-58-53">00:58:53</a>]  - But catfish is native to Florida.

[<a id="00-58-55">00:58:55</a>]  - Jamie, find that shit.

[<a id="00-58-56">00:58:56</a>]  - What's this fish?

[<a id="00-58-57">00:58:57</a>]  Chubby GPT might know this.

[<a id="00-58-59">00:58:59</a>]  - It was just freaky, like what the fuck?

[<a id="00-59-02">00:59:02</a>]  They're just kind of walking up almost like a sliding across to leave the lake across

[<a id="00-59-07">00:59:07</a>]  to another body of water.

[<a id="00-59-09">00:59:09</a>]  I was like, what the fuck?

[<a id="00-59-10">00:59:10</a>]  They do that?

[<a id="00-59-11">00:59:11</a>]  - That's some hard shit.

[<a id="00-59-12">00:59:12</a>]  We can win fish of the year.

[<a id="00-59-15">00:59:15</a>]  - No, don't bring that shit over there.

[<a id="00-59-17">00:59:17</a>]  Because it's so...

[<a id="00-59-19">00:59:19</a>]  - It's called the walking catfish.

[<a id="00-59-21">00:59:21</a>]  - Is it Chinese?

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  - I can't remember, but it's not native to that area.

[<a id="00-59-28">00:59:28</a>]  - Yeah, it's that one.

[<a id="00-59-30">00:59:30</a>]  Florida is home for many introduced species, including at least 48 kinds of fish

[<a id="00-59-38">00:59:38</a>]  from other states and countries.

[<a id="00-59-40">00:59:40</a>]  One of these is the walking catfish.

[<a id="00-59-42">00:59:42</a>]  Native to areas of Southeast Asia, the walking catfish is able to breathe air.

[<a id="00-59-48">00:59:48</a>]  That's not a fucking fish.

[<a id="00-59-50">00:59:50</a>]  And wriggle across land to invade new water bodies.

[<a id="00-59-56">00:59:56</a>]  - It was so creepy when I said, what the fuck?

[<a id="00-59-58">00:59:58</a>]  I thought it was a...

[<a id="00-59-59">00:59:59</a>]  - You saw one of these for real?

[<a id="01-00-00">01:00:00</a>]  - No, I saw it on video.

[<a id="01-00-01">01:00:01</a>]  Like, that's a fake.

[<a id="01-00-02">01:00:02</a>]  It can't be real.

[<a id="01-00-03">01:00:03</a>]  And somebody's like, no, that's a real thing.

[<a id="01-00-04">01:00:04</a>]  It's a problem in Florida.

[<a id="01-00-06">01:00:06</a>]  - Oh, it looks hideous.

[<a id="01-00-08">01:00:08</a>]  - I know.

[<a id="01-00-09">01:00:09</a>]  - Oh, this is some fucking...

[<a id="01-00-10">01:00:10</a>]  This is like...

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  - This is fucking alien shit.

[<a id="01-00-13">01:00:13</a>]  - The Henry Tiger would be down for this shit.

[<a id="01-00-15">01:00:15</a>]  - So, some asshole brought it from Asia and just dump it in Florida.

[<a id="01-00-20">01:00:20</a>]  And it reproduced like crazy and it voraciously eat other fish, you know?

[<a id="01-00-25">01:00:25</a>]  - It's funny he did that in Florida.

[<a id="01-00-27">01:00:27</a>]  I think it's a guy who did it.

[<a id="01-00-29">01:00:29</a>]  It's funny he did that in Florida because that's literally what we did with people as well, right?

[<a id="01-00-33">01:00:33</a>]  We just dropped a bunch of like horrible people there and they started procreating.

[<a id="01-00-38">01:00:38</a>]  - Now, which group are you talking about?

[<a id="01-00-42">01:00:42</a>]  - I really wish I could see the visual of what popped in your head.

[<a id="01-00-48">01:00:48</a>]  - Oh, it is white trash, my dear.

[<a id="01-00-51">01:00:51</a>]  - No, no, no.

[<a id="01-00-52">01:00:52</a>]  He was thinking the ones that got put in the tunnels to build railways and stuff.

[<a id="01-00-59">01:00:59</a>]  - Chinese people weren't pushed into Florida, were they?

[<a id="01-01-01">01:01:01</a>]  - No, no, no.

[<a id="01-01-02">01:01:02</a>]  - I'm sure they went everywhere to build those tracks.

[<a id="01-01-07">01:01:07</a>]  - So, what temperature can these fish live at?

[<a id="01-01-14">01:01:14</a>]  - I mean, warm area, obviously.

[<a id="01-01-16">01:01:16</a>]  - They love Florida.

[<a id="01-01-18">01:01:18</a>]  They're from Southeast Asia.

[<a id="01-01-19">01:01:19</a>]  That's kind of like the same.

[<a id="01-01-20">01:01:20</a>]  - Would they survive in Lake Zurich?

[<a id="01-01-22">01:01:22</a>]  - Oh.

[<a id="01-01-24">01:01:24</a>]  - If we bring...

[<a id="01-01-26">01:01:26</a>]  - I swear to God, if I be from there like, "Did you hear about this Chinese fish?"

[<a id="01-01-31">01:01:31</a>]  I know which fucking asshole went to China and brought it back.

[<a id="01-01-35">01:01:35</a>]  - It is edible.

[<a id="01-01-36">01:01:36</a>]  - But you'll be ground zero for this because you're the one that gave us the idea.

[<a id="01-01-42">01:01:42</a>]  It is edible.

[<a id="01-01-43">01:01:43</a>]  They eat it in Indonesia and in Thailand.

[<a id="01-01-46">01:01:46</a>]  - That doesn't mean anything.

[<a id="01-01-47">01:01:47</a>]  Those people eat anything.

[<a id="01-01-52">01:01:52</a>]  - The Americans haven't caught on.

[<a id="01-01-54">01:01:54</a>]  - Okay, walking catfish versus those Chinese pythons, who's going to win?

[<a id="01-01-59">01:01:59</a>]  - I mean, that's another thing that they brought, some different kind of lizard to fucking Florida

[<a id="01-02-03">01:02:03</a>]  and things like that.

[<a id="01-02-04">01:02:04</a>]  - Yeah, which is a Chinese python or some python...

[<a id="01-02-09">01:02:09</a>]  - Whatever it is, I fucking don't know.

[<a id="01-02-11">01:02:11</a>]  - Because the thing is, a python's going to have a really hard time squashing a catfish.

[<a id="01-02-16">01:02:16</a>]  Have these catfish got sharp teeth?

[<a id="01-02-18">01:02:18</a>]  Could a catfish like this take out a python?

[<a id="01-02-21">01:02:21</a>]  - I mean, they look like one of my ex-girlfriends.

[<a id="01-02-23">01:02:23</a>]  Jesus Christ.

[<a id="01-02-25">01:02:25</a>]  - And also, cop fighting's not allowed in most parts of the world.

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  But what about sander versus...

[<a id="01-02-32">01:02:32</a>]  - Sander versus catfish.

[<a id="01-02-33">01:02:33</a>]  It's an interesting thought you have there, Harry, because they found remains of the walking

[<a id="01-02-40">01:02:40</a>]  catfish in the river Tong near Bolton, Northern England.

[<a id="01-02-46">01:02:46</a>]  - Oh, my God.

[<a id="01-02-47">01:02:47</a>]  - It went transatlantic.

[<a id="01-02-49">01:02:49</a>]  - Wow.

[<a id="01-02-52">01:02:52</a>]  - Well, you know what happened is this super massive container traveling across from country

[<a id="01-03-01">01:03:01</a>]  to country, and sometimes, you know, you have barnacles and other things kind of attach

[<a id="01-03-06">01:03:06</a>]  themselves to their ship, and they go from country to country.

[<a id="01-03-09">01:03:09</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-03-10">01:03:10</a>]  - And at times, these things have a devastating impact, you know, and honestly, as terrible

[<a id="01-03-16">01:03:16</a>]  as COVID watch, which is hitting five years this coming March, I'm surprised we don't

[<a id="01-03-21">01:03:21</a>]  have as more disease and...

[<a id="01-03-24">01:03:24</a>]  - Oh, the next one's coming, my man.

[<a id="01-03-26">01:03:26</a>]  - The amount of people traveling overseas, it is shocking how little compared to what

[<a id="01-03-33">01:03:33</a>]  it could happen, you know?

[<a id="01-03-34">01:03:34</a>]  - But I mean, luckily, the next pandemic is in the making.

[<a id="01-03-38">01:03:38</a>]  The FT was just announcing this the other day, a deadly disease that jump from animals

[<a id="01-03-46">01:03:46</a>]  to humans.

[<a id="01-03-47">01:03:47</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="01-03-48">01:03:48</a>]  - This time around, it's probably a real from animal to human.

[<a id="01-03-50">01:03:50</a>]  - I mean, there's some crazy shit going, because you know there's this whole thing about the

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  Ukrainians are working, or your buddies, the Americans, are working on some kind of chemical

[<a id="01-04-05">01:04:05</a>]  weapons/virus that can target genes, so they're working on a bug to kill Russians, and now...

[<a id="01-04-14">01:04:14</a>]  - Hang on, what now?

[<a id="01-04-16">01:04:16</a>]  - Good.

[<a id="01-04-17">01:04:17</a>]  - Are you making this up?

[<a id="01-04-20">01:04:20</a>]  - No, I'm not making this up.

[<a id="01-04-21">01:04:21</a>]  - Wait a minute.

[<a id="01-04-22">01:04:22</a>]  - There was a Russian general that recently got whacked in Moscow.

[<a id="01-04-26">01:04:26</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="01-04-27">01:04:27</a>]  - And he was the guy saying...

[<a id="01-04-28">01:04:28</a>]  - Sorry, that's another Tuesday.

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  - All right, so let's start from the beginning.

[<a id="01-04-33">01:04:33</a>]  So number one is there's various chemical and biological...

[<a id="01-04-37">01:04:37</a>]  - Sorry, card is full.

[<a id="01-04-39">01:04:39</a>]  - Oh, okay.

[<a id="01-04-40">01:04:40</a>]  Good time for a quick time out before I get into this conspiracy theory.

[<a id="01-04-44">01:04:44</a>]  - I'm not sure how much we actually got there.

[<a id="01-04-47">01:04:47</a>]  - Oh, we did?

[<a id="01-04-48">01:04:48</a>]  It wasn't recording?

[<a id="01-04-49">01:04:49</a>]  - We got it on that thing.

[<a id="01-04-51">01:04:51</a>]  Maybe we just carry on, hit the record, and then we just roll, because we got that sound

[<a id="01-04-58">01:04:58</a>]  source, we got this thing, we got...

[<a id="01-05-00">01:05:00</a>]  - All right, all right.

[<a id="01-05-02">01:05:02</a>]  It recorded most of it.

[<a id="01-05-04">01:05:04</a>]  It recorded most of it.

[<a id="01-05-05">01:05:05</a>]  It should be fine.

[<a id="01-05-06">01:05:06</a>]  Okay, go on.

[<a id="01-05-07">01:05:07</a>]  Go on with the Russian killer fucking virus.

[<a id="01-05-10">01:05:10</a>]  - No, so number one is you know there's a bunch of bio and chemical labs that were being run

[<a id="01-05-17">01:05:17</a>]  by the Ukrainians and the Americans together in Ukraine, right?

[<a id="01-05-21">01:05:21</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="01-05-22">01:05:22</a>]  - There was a bunch of these.

[<a id="01-05-23">01:05:23</a>]  - Can I tell you something?

[<a id="01-05-24">01:05:24</a>]  Labs are everywhere.

[<a id="01-05-25">01:05:25</a>]  - Yeah, but there's labs and there's labs.

[<a id="01-05-27">01:05:27</a>]  There's labs where you get your sperm tested, and there's labs where you create viruses...

[<a id="01-05-32">01:05:32</a>]  - I've been to those.

[<a id="01-05-33">01:05:33</a>]  - That will, you know, where you create Wuhan labs and this kind of stuff, right?

[<a id="01-05-38">01:05:38</a>]  So and then there was a Russian general who was, he was responsible for saying, "Okay,

[<a id="01-05-44">01:05:44</a>]  the first thing we do..."

[<a id="01-05-45">01:05:45</a>]  - That's the recent assassination, right?

[<a id="01-05-47">01:05:47</a>]  - Most of these chemical labs were on the border, the contested border between Ukraine

[<a id="01-05-52">01:05:52</a>]  and Russia.

[<a id="01-05-53">01:05:53</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-05-54">01:05:54</a>]  - And yeah, the guy that got assassinated recently, he said, "All right, these labs,

[<a id="01-05-58">01:05:58</a>]  that's the first thing we take when we invade, because there's this shit going on in there."

[<a id="01-06-02">01:06:02</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-06-03">01:06:03</a>]  - And apparently, according to Russians, they're working on like viruses or something that

[<a id="01-06-12">01:06:12</a>]  can target genetic groups.

[<a id="01-06-15">01:06:15</a>]  And then this is now, the next level of this, I think, is being experimented with in the

[<a id="01-06-22">01:06:22</a>]  Middle East somewhere.

[<a id="01-06-24">01:06:24</a>]  So they're trying to make viruses you can say, "Let's just..."

[<a id="01-06-27">01:06:27</a>]  - Genocidal viruses.

[<a id="01-06-28">01:06:28</a>]  - You don't have to tell me...

[<a id="01-06-29">01:06:29</a>]  - Yeah, you're right.

[<a id="01-06-30">01:06:30</a>]  You don't have to tell me this, Harry, because in a couple months, I'll be locked up in the

[<a id="01-06-33">01:06:33</a>]  lab for $12,000.

[<a id="01-06-36">01:06:36</a>]  - So you're here making sure the Japanese people get wiped out this time.

[<a id="01-06-41">01:06:41</a>]  - No, but he's gonna be the survivor, because you're ethnically Korean.

[<a id="01-06-45">01:06:45</a>]  - I know.

[<a id="01-06-46">01:06:46</a>]  I'm gonna get caught one of these days.

[<a id="01-06-49">01:06:49</a>]  You know, one time, they made me write a chart to prove like my Japanese ancestry.

[<a id="01-06-56">01:06:56</a>]  So I have to put both of my parents, they have Japanese name, then I have to put their

[<a id="01-07-02">01:07:02</a>]  parents' name.

[<a id="01-07-03">01:07:03</a>]  And I don't remember their names.

[<a id="01-07-06">01:07:06</a>]  So I forgot one time I went in, I just made up some generic Japanese name for both of

[<a id="01-07-11">01:07:11</a>]  my parents, my mom and my dad.

[<a id="01-07-14">01:07:14</a>]  Well, years later, when I went back to the lab, I had to make the same chart.

[<a id="01-07-18">01:07:18</a>]  And I know I put the wrong name, because I have another chart with different name for

[<a id="01-07-22">01:07:22</a>]  both of my grandparents.

[<a id="01-07-24">01:07:24</a>]  And I made a new one.

[<a id="01-07-26">01:07:26</a>]  But nobody actually, nobody checked the two papers, you know.

[<a id="01-07-29">01:07:29</a>]  - Did your grandparents have like proper Korean names, like Daewoo or something?

[<a id="01-07-33">01:07:33</a>]  - No, no, no, I had to put Japanese name because I have to prove to them I'm ethnically Japanese

[<a id="01-07-37">01:07:37</a>]  so I can't do the study.

[<a id="01-07-39">01:07:39</a>]  So I just made up like some dumb Japanese name for both of them.

[<a id="01-07-42">01:07:42</a>]  But I don't know which name I did in two different study at the same lab.

[<a id="01-07-46">01:07:46</a>]  So if somebody was paying attention, if they compared, it's completely like names all wrong.

[<a id="01-07-52">01:07:52</a>]  - I tell you when it's going to strike is when AI starts taking over the shit.

[<a id="01-07-57">01:07:57</a>]  Because I think there's a difference between us two and Yoshi.

[<a id="01-08-02">01:08:02</a>]  - A genetic difference?

[<a id="01-08-04">01:08:04</a>]  - No, it's a chat GPT difference.

[<a id="01-08-06">01:08:06</a>]  Last time I tried searching for myself on chat GPT, it doesn't find me.

[<a id="01-08-10">01:08:10</a>]  In fact, it stops you from being able to look up individuals.

[<a id="01-08-14">01:08:14</a>]  But if you're a person of prominence, and Yoshi is because you're in IMDB.

[<a id="01-08-18">01:08:18</a>]  - I hate when you say that.

[<a id="01-08-20">01:08:20</a>]  - You're in IMDB.

[<a id="01-08-22">01:08:22</a>]  - So is millions of people.

[<a id="01-08-24">01:08:24</a>]  - If you ask chat GPT who is Yoshi Obayashi.

[<a id="01-08-28">01:08:28</a>]  - Don't do that.

[<a id="01-08-30">01:08:30</a>]  - I've done it already.

[<a id="01-08-32">01:08:32</a>]  And it will say, yeah, he's that motherfucker that lied on his origin chart.

[<a id="01-08-38">01:08:38</a>]  But we got him tagged in the database for gender reassignment or something.

[<a id="01-08-44">01:08:44</a>]  Yoshi Obayashi is an American stand-up comedian and former adult film executive.

[<a id="01-08-50">01:08:50</a>]  - Are you making that up?

[<a id="01-08-52">01:08:52</a>]  - No.

[<a id="01-08-54">01:08:54</a>]  Based in Los Angeles, California.

[<a id="01-08-56">01:08:56</a>]  After graduating from the Evergreen State College, he entered the adult entertainment industry.

[<a id="01-09-00">01:09:00</a>]  - Oh, that's some dumb genetic thing that I wrote.

[<a id="01-09-02">01:09:02</a>]  - Working for...

[<a id="01-09-04">01:09:04</a>]  - That's a lie.

[<a id="01-09-06">01:09:06</a>]  - That's from Top Secret.

[<a id="01-09-08">01:09:08</a>]  Most of the references are from Top Secret.

[<a id="01-09-10">01:09:10</a>]  But let's read it out. This is great. I'm enjoying watching Yoshi as you read it.

[<a id="01-09-14">01:09:14</a>]  - It's dumb.

[<a id="01-09-16">01:09:16</a>]  - During his tenure, he produced over 800 titles and collaborated with renowned directors such as

[<a id="01-09-20">01:09:20</a>]  John Saliano, Rocco Sifredi, John Leslie, Joey Silvera, and Christoph Clark.

[<a id="01-09-26">01:09:26</a>]  I don't know Christoph Clark's work.

[<a id="01-09-30">01:09:30</a>]  - He's French.

[<a id="01-09-32">01:09:32</a>]  - Christoph Clark.

[<a id="01-09-34">01:09:34</a>]  - You made French porn?

[<a id="01-09-36">01:09:36</a>]  - No, these guys are working for you in Jamaica.

[<a id="01-09-38">01:09:38</a>]  - But actually, what does French porn entail, Harry?

[<a id="01-09-44">01:09:44</a>]  Is it like French cinema?

[<a id="01-09-46">01:09:46</a>]  - I don't know, but I was going to say that maybe indirectly that French porn might have inspired the events that unfolded in Mazan.

[<a id="01-09-54">01:09:54</a>]  So it's like a weird circle.

[<a id="01-10-00">01:10:00</a>]  - As of January 2025, Yoshi is scheduled to perform in London.

[<a id="01-10-06">01:10:06</a>]  He will be headlining an international comedy night at the White Heart in Southwark on January 15th.

[<a id="01-10-12">01:10:12</a>]  This is on fucking Chachibidi.

[<a id="01-10-14">01:10:14</a>]  - Fuck.

[<a id="01-10-16">01:10:16</a>]  - This event is notable as it marks a rare UK appearance for Yoshi.

[<a id="01-10-20">01:10:20</a>]  - Motherfucking Chachibidi.

[<a id="01-10-22">01:10:22</a>]  - Who was previously open for comedy legends and appeared in various television shows and podcasts.

[<a id="01-10-28">01:10:28</a>]  This is a sources event, Brian.

[<a id="01-10-30">01:10:30</a>]  - I know this is not a very fashionable thing to say, but I just think AI is fucking overrated.

[<a id="01-10-36">01:10:36</a>]  This thread.

[<a id="01-10-38">01:10:38</a>]  I think too many people have vested interest because of the stock market and things like that.

[<a id="01-10-44">01:10:44</a>]  And also, I was reading this French ethic guy, and he has a background in computer programming.

[<a id="01-10-50">01:10:50</a>]  And he was kind of, he thinks it's laughable that these simple things that can't even do, simple things that children can do.

[<a id="01-10-58">01:10:58</a>]  And I think, because I'm a dumb guy, so I know everyone's going to criticize me.

[<a id="01-11-02">01:11:02</a>]  But I think too many people watch too many of those Terminator movies, you know?

[<a id="01-11-06">01:11:06</a>]  - Oh yeah, yeah.

[<a id="01-11-08">01:11:08</a>]  - I think there's just money involved. That's why they want to make this such a big deal.

[<a id="01-11-12">01:11:12</a>]  - I got something to help you. So you know that dude who blew up in his Tesla truck under a Trump building?

[<a id="01-11-18">01:11:18</a>]  You've heard that story, right?

[<a id="01-11-20">01:11:20</a>]  - Oh yeah, I stayed at that hotel on the night of the election when Trump lost.

[<a id="01-11-27">01:11:27</a>]  - Wow.

[<a id="01-11-28">01:11:28</a>]  - I was there, yeah.

[<a id="01-11-29">01:11:29</a>]  - So if he'd won, you could have seen this in real time, maybe.

[<a id="01-11-32">01:11:32</a>]  - Oh no, no, this is like the last election.

[<a id="01-11-35">01:11:35</a>]  - So here's the interesting part about that.

[<a id="01-11-37">01:11:37</a>]  In the news, they've been saying, yeah, and somehow this terrorist who is former, what is he, some elite troop dude.

[<a id="01-11-47">01:11:47</a>]  - But is that a terrorist attack? Nobody got hurt except for him.

[<a id="01-11-50">01:11:50</a>]  - No, there is a terrorist reference because they feel like he was influenced by ISIS because he had a flag of ISIS with him.

[<a id="01-12-00">01:12:00</a>]  - And there's multiple things. Number one is I think whoever made that attack happen underestimated how strong a cyber truck is.

[<a id="01-12-08">01:12:08</a>]  The Tesla truck, because I think that was meant to be a big explosion.

[<a id="01-12-12">01:12:12</a>]  But the other thing is in the news they're reporting that he used chat GPT to help plan his attack.

[<a id="01-12-18">01:12:18</a>]  - How about that?

[<a id="01-12-20">01:12:20</a>]  - This is the key thing. I was listening to this news, they apparently published what they've been searching for on chat GPT.

[<a id="01-12-26">01:12:26</a>]  The real story here is chat GPT is so good now at search that even terrorists are using it instead of Google.

[<a id="01-12-35">01:12:35</a>]  Because what he searched for was not like how to make weapons and stuff.

[<a id="01-12-41">01:12:41</a>]  It was simply how to do some route, like where is the Trump location?

[<a id="01-12-46">01:12:46</a>]  - It's called chat what?

[<a id="01-12-48">01:12:48</a>]  - Chat GPT.

[<a id="01-12-49">01:12:49</a>]  - But for them is it chat genie or something like that?

[<a id="01-12-52">01:12:52</a>]  - Oh for fuck's sake, what's this? Just rub it thrice.

[<a id="01-12-57">01:12:57</a>]  - It's interesting because the guy who blew himself up, he went to the same military base with Timothy McBae and Terry Nichols who bombed Oklahoma City.

[<a id="01-13-10">01:13:10</a>]  And this year is the 30th anniversary.

[<a id="01-13-12">01:13:12</a>]  - But hang on, this is Fort Bragg you're talking about. Fort Bragg has been home to hundreds of thousands, millions of soldiers.

[<a id="01-13-21">01:13:21</a>]  - Sure, but it's interesting both of them truck bombing, I mean of course this is a very small scale because he only hurt himself.

[<a id="01-13-28">01:13:28</a>]  But I thought it was interesting that the whole, I don't know, I think the New Orleans was first right?

[<a id="01-13-39">01:13:39</a>]  - That was first and that one was in Fort Bragg as well.

[<a id="01-13-41">01:13:41</a>]  They both were at Fort Bragg but they were not overlapping apparently.

[<a id="01-13-46">01:13:46</a>]  - Yeah, it's interesting they're both because Timothy McBae was in Philippines, Manila, same time the guy, one of the bombers from 9/11 was, so sometimes people have this theory that maybe, I don't think they knew each other, they just happened to be same place and same area at the same time I guess.

[<a id="01-14-11">01:14:11</a>]  - Wasn't that the thing with Vienna in 2023, like Hitler, Stalin and Lenin all hung out, oh and the Kaiser, all hung out in Vienna at one point in 2023.

[<a id="01-14-27">01:14:27</a>]  - Wait, sorry, 1923. - Yeah, okay, okay, I was going to.

[<a id="01-14-31">01:14:31</a>]  - In 1923. - They're on open mic together.

[<a id="01-14-33">01:14:33</a>]  - It probably is like how to seduce society.

[<a id="01-14-37">01:14:37</a>]  - Yeah, I mean like even one of you guys told me like Lenin lived, I went to the house he used to live in.

[<a id="01-14-42">01:14:42</a>]  - Yeah, he used to live around the corner.

[<a id="01-14-43">01:14:43</a>]  - But the Swedish communist, they let him invite into, within the inner circles or something, so he got sick of it so he left and of course the big revolution started in Russia so he left, you know.

[<a id="01-14-53">01:14:53</a>]  - But so have you ever been to Fort Bragg, do you know?

[<a id="01-14-57">01:14:57</a>]  - I'm driving by but I didn't go in.

[<a id="01-14-59">01:14:59</a>]  - You cannot just go into Fort Bragg.

[<a id="01-15-02">01:15:02</a>]  - I mean if you have an invitation, somebody lives in there, there's special events or I used to go to Fort Lewis in Tacoma, Washington because they used to let civilians take classes and things like that.

[<a id="01-15-14">01:15:14</a>]  - By the way, it just changed its name recently, it's now Fort Liberty.

[<a id="01-15-19">01:15:19</a>]  - Oh, where?

[<a id="01-15-20">01:15:20</a>]  - Fort Bragg.

[<a id="01-15-21">01:15:21</a>]  - It's now Fort Liberty, Fort Freedom.

[<a id="01-15-24">01:15:24</a>]  - I hate this shit, this is so stupid.

[<a id="01-15-30">01:15:30</a>]  - I mean, number one is why is anybody owning a fort in 2025, that's ridiculous, forts have no value.

[<a id="01-15-40">01:15:40</a>]  - What, do you want to call it Barracks Bragg?

[<a id="01-15-43">01:15:43</a>]  - Well they need a training facility, right, to work on that.

[<a id="01-15-47">01:15:47</a>]  - And it comes from the old cavalry.

[<a id="01-15-49">01:15:49</a>]  - They need to show the access to public, what they're doing.

[<a id="01-15-51">01:15:51</a>]  - But couldn't you get on one of those medical programs that are happening down there, that sounds like a fun one.

[<a id="01-15-57">01:15:57</a>]  - Sounds like a fucking hoot.

[<a id="01-15-59">01:15:59</a>]  - I'd say whatever you gave to that guy, give me some of that shit.

[<a id="01-16-02">01:16:02</a>]  - What do you reckon MKUltra would be named today, like if they would run a program like that today, what do you reckon they would call it?

[<a id="01-16-10">01:16:10</a>]  - It would be even more entirely, because you know the naming is a thing in itself.

[<a id="01-16-17">01:16:17</a>]  - Yes, the CIA has rules on how to name projects.

[<a id="01-16-20">01:16:20</a>]  - Yeah, and they broke the rules on this because the guy was so psyched about what he was doing, he said let's give it a sexy name.

[<a id="01-16-27">01:16:27</a>]  - But now it would just be Clickbait or something.

[<a id="01-16-31">01:16:31</a>]  - Operation Clickbait?

[<a id="01-16-33">01:16:33</a>]  - No, it would be a name that someone on 4chan came up with and is somehow super sexy.

[<a id="01-16-45">01:16:45</a>]  - So like a psy-op within a psy-op.

[<a id="01-16-47">01:16:47</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="01-16-48">01:16:48</a>]  - I don't know how much we've done, I just want to make sure a couple of things before I forget.

[<a id="01-16-53">01:16:53</a>]  - Because one, I appreciate you guys inviting me, seriously.

[<a id="01-16-57">01:16:57</a>]  - You are bored now about this conversation.

[<a id="01-17-00">01:17:00</a>]  - I appreciate you guys inviting me, there's things that I kind of give it up on, this one-man show.

[<a id="01-17-08">01:17:08</a>]  - I don't know where this is going to go, but at least you guys made me semi-excited about it again and coming here was great.

[<a id="01-17-18">01:17:18</a>]  - There are still things about this country that are very mystifying, but those boarding schools, I guess that's the one that's really interesting to me.

[<a id="01-17-30">01:17:30</a>]  - Want to go and hang out there?

[<a id="01-17-33">01:17:33</a>]  - I mean, if eating junk food is bad for Americans, I think some of these elite schools, I don't know what they do.

[<a id="01-17-41">01:17:41</a>]  - They are bad for society, that's for sure.

[<a id="01-17-44">01:17:44</a>]  - Because it's not like one of those great schools where they teach them discipline, classics, liberal arts and basic mathematics and science and stuff like that.

[<a id="01-17-56">01:17:56</a>]  - It just seems like the one in Geneva, the Rosé or whatever that famous says, that they're all about preparing these, helping these young kids...

[<a id="01-18-10">01:18:10</a>]  - To own shit.

[<a id="01-18-11">01:18:11</a>]  - ...generation of wealth and not necessarily to challenge them anyway, but to conduct themselves as people of position of power and things like that.

[<a id="01-18-22">01:18:22</a>]  - Yeah, but look how well it works. Trump is a perfect example, but it's like a bug in your head.

[<a id="01-18-28">01:18:28</a>]  - He went to a military boarding school, that's true.

[<a id="01-18-30">01:18:30</a>]  - Yeah, and it's a human bug is that we mistake confidence for competence. I saw this, I went to not a really good private school in England, but I saw this...

[<a id="01-18-47">01:18:47</a>]  - Private school or boarding school?

[<a id="01-18-48">01:18:48</a>]  - A boarding school, yeah.

[<a id="01-18-49">01:18:49</a>]  - Oh, wow.

[<a id="01-18-50">01:18:50</a>]  - I was at a Quaker boarding school.

[<a id="01-18-52">01:18:52</a>]  - Huh?

[<a id="01-18-53">01:18:53</a>]  - Yeah, that's that whole podcast in itself, but the thing is, it's body language, voice, attitude. You walk in, I remember this guy that I worked with once who'd been to Eton, one of the best schools.

[<a id="01-19-06">01:19:06</a>]  - Oh, yes.

[<a id="01-19-07">01:19:07</a>]  - And he's an old dude now.

[<a id="01-19-08">01:19:08</a>]  - People, and he would just...

[<a id="01-19-09">01:19:09</a>]  - Duke Wellington went there.

[<a id="01-19-10">01:19:10</a>]  - He just had a way of sticking his chin up and he had this like Prince Charles accent and he said, "No." And he would take ages to fucking say anything.

[<a id="01-19-19">01:19:19</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-19-20">01:19:20</a>]  - And he'd be like, "No, I think..." And then people would work like 15-hour shifts just to do whatever retarded shit just came out of his mouth because obedience, that shit fucking works.

[<a id="01-19-33">01:19:33</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-19-34">01:19:34</a>]  - And again, it's because we're too stupid and so we go Trump, he's got the balls, so he must be good or whatever it is, like whoever it is, it's just like...

[<a id="01-19-44">01:19:44</a>]  - Remember that time I told you when Glenn Maxwell received the sentencing? And after the victim spoke, I just feel nothing but sympathy and feel bad for the young ladies, all these women who were young ladies when they were a victim.

[<a id="01-19-57">01:19:57</a>]  But when Glenn spoke, she just captivated the whole room. Her upper class Cambridge/Oxford education and all those years of her... because her father wanted her to act with powerful men and women, that the way she carried herself, it was very seductive, you know?

[<a id="01-20-18">01:20:18</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-20-19">01:20:19</a>]  - And when people like that speak and they understand that pageantry, how you conduct yourself, yeah, they seem like authority.

[<a id="01-20-32">01:20:32</a>]  - And it's pure psychology, that's all it is. It's incredible. It's because there's something, when you see someone that appears to have no self-doubt whatsoever...

[<a id="01-20-43">01:20:43</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-20-44">01:20:44</a>]  - You just go, "Oh."

[<a id="01-20-46">01:20:46</a>]  - And it's always that loudest asshole that gets the most attention, right?

[<a id="01-20-49">01:20:49</a>]  - Yeah. I mean, you know, have you ever met Eddie Izzard?

[<a id="01-20-54">01:20:54</a>]  - I don't know who he is, I've never met that person.

[<a id="01-20-56">01:20:56</a>]  - He had a great bit where he was talking about how the English took over India, and they said, "We took over India with the clever use of flags."

[<a id="01-21-04">01:21:04</a>]  And then we showed up and we said, "We claim this country for the Queen." And they go, "You can't fucking do that, we live here."

[<a id="01-21-10">01:21:10</a>]  "Do you have a flag?" And it's just a pure confidence trick. It's just, and yeah, anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this.

[<a id="01-21-18">01:21:18</a>]  - No, no, but...

[<a id="01-21-19">01:21:19</a>]  - Which is also, ironically, America, a pure confidence trick.

[<a id="01-21-23">01:21:23</a>]  - But this is interesting because I think last two seasons of Game of Thrones didn't work, but one other thing, they pitched this idea that it's just whoever told the story controlled the narrative,

[<a id="01-21-34">01:21:34</a>]  whether a historian or whoever is telling that leadership role, it's just whoever told the story, they would buy into it, you know?

[<a id="01-21-42">01:21:42</a>]  So stories matters, you know? And I think that's why I think these business people are in the head of the studios because if they're good at communicating, I think that's what they do.

[<a id="01-21-52">01:21:52</a>]  They really seduce the populace, you know?

[<a id="01-21-56">01:21:56</a>]  - On that fantastic note, we are at the end, and thanks for being here.

[<a id="01-22-01">01:22:01</a>]  - Okay, so we're taking a break or doing another one or...?

[<a id="01-22-05">01:22:05</a>]  - Not tonight.

[<a id="01-22-06">01:22:06</a>]  - Not tonight. Okay, so we're down for the night.

[<a id="01-22-07">01:22:07</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-22-08">01:22:08</a>]  - Okay, like I said, thanks for the invite.

[<a id="01-22-10">01:22:10</a>]  - We're doing one tomorrow.

[<a id="01-22-12">01:22:12</a>]  - Yeah. All right. See you tomorrow.

[<a id="01-22-15">01:22:15</a>]  - Jesus.

[<a id="01-22-16">01:22:16</a>]  - So what are you going to do? Because it just seemed like none of the episodes were that good.

[<a id="01-22-23">01:22:23</a>]  - Oh, just chill. I mean, this is going to take me some time.

[<a id="01-22-27">01:22:27</a>]  - I guess it'll look good once you cut all the fat out of it, when they're going nowhere, right?

[<a id="01-22-32">01:22:32</a>]  - I mean, I think...

[<a id="01-22-34">01:22:34</a>]  - This fish, you've really cut me off. This has got to be a joke. He doesn't mean it, and I can't believe you really meant it.

[<a id="01-22-41">01:22:41</a>]  - I have to lean into it because it's so retarded.

[<a id="01-22-45">01:22:45</a>]  - It's beautiful. I like it. It's like the one story that isn't making everyone feel miserable.
