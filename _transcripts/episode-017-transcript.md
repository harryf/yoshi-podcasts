[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  Cool. Yeah, we actually lost quite a lot of this. We've got a lot of stuff here. We've

[<a id="00-00-29">00:00:29</a>]  lost quite a lot of this from the Zoom, but we'll be all right with the backups. You lost

[<a id="00-00-35">00:00:35</a>]  what? You remember you said it wasn't recording a long time? For a bit, yeah. It only done

[<a id="00-00-43">00:00:43</a>]  about 98 megabytes on each track. Normally an episode is like 300 megabytes a track.

[<a id="00-00-52">00:00:52</a>]  But anyway, we'll be fine because with this thing plus that thing. Okay, I can hear now.

[<a id="00-01-01">00:01:01</a>]  It will work out okay. And possibly a little bit of audio AI processing. We've got to work

[<a id="00-01-17">00:01:17</a>]  on AI Yoshi. Now there's a thing like I actually trained. Wait, are you already recording this?

[<a id="00-01-28">00:01:28</a>]  Of course. What do you think? Oh, we're just rambling away. No, you didn't do that hand

[<a id="00-01-32">00:01:32</a>]  thing. I can do it. You don't have to. There you go. But I can chuck the tea bag in there.

[<a id="00-01-39">00:01:39</a>]  Thank you. No, there's this company called Eleven Labs. Basically, if you have, what

[<a id="00-01-48">00:01:48</a>]  do you need? You need about three to four hours of your voice. Yeah. You upload it and

[<a id="00-01-56">00:01:56</a>]  it produces a thing that sounds like you. Great. No, and it's really, it's like, yes,

[<a id="00-02-04">00:02:04</a>]  like I made something out of this, sent it to my kids and they're like, why are you talking

[<a id="00-02-11">00:02:11</a>]  in this slightly weird way? But they thought it was me. So it fooled my kids. And the problem

[<a id="00-02-18">00:02:18</a>]  was as a recording, I was trying something where I was just like recording, reading a

[<a id="00-02-25">00:02:25</a>]  book and I was too monotone. But on this podcast, the way we're talking, like with the times

[<a id="00-02-32">00:02:32</a>]  that you freak out and this kind of stuff. Plus the times where you just expect it's

[<a id="00-02-37">00:02:37</a>]  going to be beautiful. It's going to be, it's going to be a better Yoshi. You will live

[<a id="00-02-41">00:02:41</a>]  on Yoshi. We will upload you to the cloud. I got a feeling that, you know, let's say

[<a id="00-02-50">00:02:50</a>]  I'm lucky enough to live another 25 to 30, 40 years at the end. If I've done enough podcasting,

[<a id="00-03-01">00:03:01</a>]  I would imagine even after I'm dead, they gather all of the podcasts from beginning

[<a id="00-03-07">00:03:07</a>]  to end. Yeah. Eventually. From beginning to end. I mean, eventually they could do something

[<a id="00-03-17">00:03:17</a>]  with AI where this person who's always negative, responding negative 90% of time, even when

[<a id="00-03-23">00:03:23</a>]  you ask me questions, it probably make probable guess like what I would say based on, you

[<a id="00-03-29">00:03:29</a>]  know, 30 years or 40 years of podcasts, I would imagine. Absolutely. That was promised though

[<a id="00-03-34">00:03:34</a>]  by a company based on X and Facebook, right? About half a decade ago. Yeah. But the thing

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  is, I mean, what large language models like chat, GPT, they're doing that basically thing,

[<a id="00-03-49">00:03:49</a>]  but they do it across a data set of everything they found on the internet. Now, if you trained

[<a id="00-03-55">00:03:55</a>]  a model specifically on you, because the basics of what these things do is they predict the

[<a id="00-04-02">00:04:02</a>]  next word. Sorry, the way you look at me and talk to me, like you're talking to it like

[<a id="00-04-06">00:04:06</a>]  the retarded person. Well, yeah. And that's going to be a tough AI challenge to simulate

[<a id="00-04-14">00:04:14</a>]  retardedness. Yes. But basically. No, by what you just said, you just trained it on the

[<a id="00-04-22">00:04:22</a>]  retarded person. Yeah. And it's basically going to predict. So in a certain way, it's

[<a id="00-04-27">00:04:27</a>]  like, if you think about, I think if you, by the time you reach a certain age, for every

[<a id="00-04-35">00:04:35</a>]  given input that you could get, like somebody says something happens, whatever your thought

[<a id="00-04-40">00:04:40</a>]  patterns are already formed, you're going to have certain responsive thoughts to that

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  person. In which case, you're effectively, it's probably the technology's not quite there

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  yet, but it could basically simulate your thought pattern. So if you, if I don't know,

[<a id="00-04-59">00:04:59</a>]  like... I mean, imagine 45 years from now, if I'm alive, I don't think I will be, but

[<a id="00-05-04">00:05:04</a>]  I'll be 100 years old. 45 years, that's quite a long time. I mean, look at all the things

[<a id="00-05-11">00:05:11</a>]  have changed in the last 20 years. Exactly. You know, I mean, you go back 30 years, how

[<a id="00-05-16">00:05:16</a>]  many people knew about internet? I mean, average people, probably nothing. How many people

[<a id="00-05-21">00:05:21</a>]  knew? Yeah, exactly. And it's 30 years ago, really not that long. I mean, not for you

[<a id="00-05-26">00:05:26</a>]  and I really. Yeah. But look, I say this because I don't know what I'm talking about, but I

[<a id="00-05-33">00:05:33</a>]  still think AI is a bit exaggerated. Yeah. The threat and everything. I think you should

[<a id="00-05-39">00:05:39</a>]  really worry more about original AI, which is Asian intelligence, how devious that part

[<a id="00-05-46">00:05:46</a>]  of the world is. You know, Hitler and Stalin killed how many millions? Mao killed even

[<a id="00-05-51">00:05:51</a>]  more, but nobody take those people seriously because he looked like a fat idiot, you know?

[<a id="00-05-57">00:05:57</a>]  But the Asian deviousness, it's, I mean, you date once, you know what I'm talking about.

[<a id="00-06-02">00:06:02</a>]  Past tense. Past tense. They did. Well, yes. But I just think what's going on in Asia is

[<a id="00-06-10">00:06:10</a>]  more threatening for the rest of the world, in my opinion. In terms of how hard they work

[<a id="00-06-17">00:06:17</a>]  and you know. Yeah, but I mean. What IQ thinks, they do quite well in places like China and.

[<a id="00-06-25">00:06:25</a>]  But don't you think there's a nice. But we don't have no regard for ethics at all. Yeah,

[<a id="00-06-31">00:06:31</a>]  OK. But I mean, I mean, look at all that cloning shit that they're doing in Asia. We would.

[<a id="00-06-39">00:06:39</a>]  We would kind of question ourselves. This is something that we should not. Are we able

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  to do it? But should we be doing it? Chinese and Korean people, they don't care. They're

[<a id="00-06-48">00:06:48</a>]  doing all kinds of weird shit right now. Sure. But I think isn't that coming from a certain

[<a id="00-06-56">00:06:56</a>]  Americanized perspective? Because, I mean, I mean, on the one hand, you're saying the

[<a id="00-07-00">00:07:00</a>]  biggest threat is Asian intelligence. I don't know how to define natural law, but there's

[<a id="00-07-06">00:07:06</a>]  there are definitely things right and wrong, whether irregardless of cultural factor that

[<a id="00-07-11">00:07:11</a>]  we have to consider. True. But the flip side is, is if you if you look at if we took a

[<a id="00-07-17">00:07:17</a>]  survey of half the nations on the planet and how they feel about America and who the biggest

[<a id="00-07-24">00:07:24</a>]  threat is, you might not they might they might be like, yeah, China, whatever. But, you know,

[<a id="00-07-31">00:07:31</a>]  you guys have had a military base in our country and have been stealing. Yeah, you're right.

[<a id="00-07-37">00:07:37</a>]  I think if I have to pick a TV show to represent America, I guess it's boys in a way. Do you

[<a id="00-07-44">00:07:44</a>]  know what I'm saying? Yes. I hate that blonde guy, but he's so America. Oh, my God. He's

[<a id="00-07-51">00:07:51</a>]  such a Mr. America. Hundred percent. And, you know, during Covid, I drove. Weirdly, I really

[<a id="00-08-01">00:08:01</a>]  miss Covid era of Covid five years ago, the coming March, because after that, July, with

[<a id="00-08-08">00:08:08</a>]  government subsidy of money and so many people afraid to trade travel, it was very freeing

[<a id="00-08-16">00:08:16</a>]  moment. I travel so much that time, more than any time I could remember last twenty, thirty

[<a id="00-08-21">00:08:21</a>]  years. And I visit most of the country, I think maybe except maybe two or three states.

[<a id="00-08-27">00:08:27</a>]  I've been to every state during Covid. And I was talking to people. I have to say Americans

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  are very generous people. I don't know about our military, corporate government entities.

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  I think there is a problematic. It's the good, bad and ugly. But I think if you go like a

[<a id="00-08-46">00:08:46</a>]  Midwest and South, I mean, you do meet a lot of decent Americans that very caring. And

[<a id="00-08-52">00:08:52</a>]  there's a couple article in New York Times recently that many of these liberal from New

[<a id="00-08-55">00:08:55</a>]  York City moved to like away from city and they were kind of shocked to find these so-called

[<a id="00-09-02">00:09:02</a>]  religious bigot are always there to help them, whether it's fire, rain, snow, you know, and

[<a id="00-09-08">00:09:08</a>]  I think they were wrong to think like that. Like. These liberal city people, they live

[<a id="00-09-13">00:09:13</a>]  in a small world, you know, of their own making. Yeah. And I think whenever they say like don't

[<a id="00-09-21">00:09:21</a>]  go, there's too dangerous. I go there. I don't have issue with it. And they will tell me

[<a id="00-09-26">00:09:26</a>]  don't go to that place, you know, vice versa. I've never had an issue really that I think

[<a id="00-09-31">00:09:31</a>]  I know it's corny to say, but I think generally speaking, I have a better experience. More

[<a id="00-09-37">00:09:37</a>]  people more often than decent to me, you know, and but I guess, I mean, there's this weird

[<a id="00-09-45">00:09:45</a>]  factor that you've got. I grew up in a small town and UK right in the UK. Yeah. And in general,

[<a id="00-09-52">00:09:52</a>]  my finding was like small town people are more social in a small scale and more more

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  likely to be generous to someone that they can see and interact with. But but on the

[<a id="00-10-05">00:10:05</a>]  on the other hand, I spend I think I've already told this story, but I spent some time in

[<a id="00-10-10">00:10:10</a>]  Washington when I was like DC or state state. Okay. I used to live. No, actually. Wait,

[<a id="00-10-16">00:10:16</a>]  I always fuck this up. State is far away from DC, isn't it? Yes. I think it was actually

[<a id="00-10-21">00:10:21</a>]  New York and DC and Washington way of Oregon over here. I think I was staying actually

[<a id="00-10-25">00:10:25</a>]  Seattle thing. Seattle, Virginia is right. Okay, good. DC. I was in I was in Virginia

[<a id="00-10-31">00:10:31</a>]  and I was staying with a friend of mine who and he got to explain at one point said you

[<a id="00-10-35">00:10:35</a>]  have to understand this term military industrial complex like in Eisenhower in Virginia. He

[<a id="00-10-43">00:10:43</a>]  said one in four people is employed directly by the military. Yeah. And then the next two

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  and three of those four are working for companies of service supply. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That translates

[<a id="00-10-56">00:10:56</a>]  into families whose kids go to a nice school is dependent on this on this industry. Sure.

[<a id="00-11-03">00:11:03</a>]  And you know, you're dropping bombs on the other side of the planet. So you don't see

[<a id="00-11-07">00:11:07</a>]  that these can be very good people. And I mean, like I was trying to relativize that

[<a id="00-11-12">00:11:12</a>]  like if you imagine living in Zurich, imagine the number one in industry was butt plugs.

[<a id="00-11-20">00:11:20</a>]  And and always have to go there. Yeah, just everyone is making their money at butt plugs.

[<a id="00-11-24">00:11:24</a>]  And I there's like, there's like the OECD is published, but we said that the the level

[<a id="00-11-30">00:11:30</a>]  of anal destruction across the planet because of butt plugs is just too much. There's like

[<a id="00-11-34">00:11:34</a>]  shit all over the place. Two, two things. You know, this concept called Dunbar 150. He was

[<a id="00-11-42">00:11:42</a>]  anthropologist sociology, he said, most people originally live in a small area, so they're

[<a id="00-11-48">00:11:48</a>]  comfortable with this American really. So most people are comfortable with what number

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  of people that they know, within 100 to 150 people, you know, but anything beyond that

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  is really hard to process. So I think if you grow up in like a small rural area, and you

[<a id="00-12-03">00:12:03</a>]  go to New York City, it must be really shocking experience to see, you know, you grow up in

[<a id="00-12-08">00:12:08</a>]  an area where you literally know everyone and know something to appear place where you

[<a id="00-12-12">00:12:12</a>]  know no one, you know, yeah, but I grew up in big cities, so I'm used to that, you know,

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  so it was for me reverse where during COVID, I really went to area where I just talked

[<a id="00-12-24">00:12:24</a>]  to anyone. Now, granted, I think if you're young, if you're a young black kid, grew up

[<a id="00-12-29">00:12:29</a>]  in certain situations like South Central LA, and you saw nothing but mayhem. And a lot

[<a id="00-12-34">00:12:34</a>]  of times people say things that maybe it's true. Maybe a lot of the other stuff is not

[<a id="00-12-38">00:12:38</a>]  true. But you have certain idea of the world. But only way you could destroy that notion

[<a id="00-12-43">00:12:43</a>]  is by traveling, you know, like you, you know, you can read all you want, but you really

[<a id="00-12-47">00:12:47</a>]  have to go places that kind of but that's for anyone. Yeah, true. That's literally for

[<a id="00-12-52">00:12:52</a>]  anyone. But if you come from those disadvantaged place there, there's extra barrier because,

[<a id="00-12-57">00:12:57</a>]  you know, growing up growing up in Southern California in the mid 80s, I was shocked how

[<a id="00-13-01">00:13:01</a>]  many people I met in like South Central LA, they've never seen ocean. Yeah, there's literally

[<a id="00-13-06">00:13:06</a>]  eight miles, 10 miles away that they're afraid to get out of their neighborhood or you get

[<a id="00-13-12">00:13:12</a>]  shot if even if you want other side of the street you share. So you know, for those people,

[<a id="00-13-17">00:13:17</a>]  it's a different it's a different invisible barrier. I didn't have that people people

[<a id="00-13-23">00:13:23</a>]  tend to live in large cities, but they only see a small bit of it. Yes. I mean, this is

[<a id="00-13-29">00:13:29</a>]  even more so for people in LA because they drive. Yeah, because when you drive, you have

[<a id="00-13-33">00:13:33</a>]  a barrier to separate you from outside the rest of the world. Yes, but the smoke and

[<a id="00-13-38">00:13:38</a>]  the flames. Yeah, but but even a city like New York, if you if you live in Brooklyn,

[<a id="00-13-45">00:13:45</a>]  say, yeah, and you work in Manhattan because you are working in finance and you are successful

[<a id="00-13-50">00:13:50</a>]  or whatever. The only thing you do see is your your commute. Yeah, the deli that you

[<a id="00-13-57">00:13:57</a>]  buy your lunch from. Yeah, the gym that you work out in. Yeah. And maybe on a Friday,

[<a id="00-14-03">00:14:03</a>]  the bar. Yeah, that's still more than what I would say people from LA because even like

[<a id="00-14-08">00:14:08</a>]  walking a couple blocks distance where they are sometimes drive to those places, you know,

[<a id="00-14-12">00:14:12</a>]  and because it's a car city. It's a car city. And and because when I lost my job 12-13 years

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  ago, part of my job was to lose weight for the medical studies. So I had no choice. I

[<a id="00-14-25">00:14:25</a>]  had to constantly walk for practical reason and plus a lot of times I don't have any money.

[<a id="00-14-30">00:14:30</a>]  So when you're forced to walk, I literally saw LA the most people don't know because

[<a id="00-14-36">00:14:36</a>]  there's something even though you've been driving many of the streets in LA, but if

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  you're driving all the time, you don't really know the city. No, unlike if you literally

[<a id="00-14-44">00:14:44</a>]  walk like wow, I never realized there's a kebab place three, but you wouldn't notice

[<a id="00-14-49">00:14:49</a>]  that because you're driving so fast, you know, New York, I think is one of the few cities

[<a id="00-14-53">00:14:53</a>]  in the world much like London. Let's say you're not allowed you're born in a city you're not

[<a id="00-14-59">00:14:59</a>]  allowed to leave within 10 mile radius. I think New York and London is one of those

[<a id="00-15-04">00:15:04</a>]  two cities or one of the few cities in the world. You could be pretty well around the

[<a id="00-15-07">00:15:07</a>]  person because you have so many different kinds of people, you know what I mean? True.

[<a id="00-15-12">00:15:12</a>]  Yeah, they are. I mean, I want them to leave but if you can leave New York and London is

[<a id="00-15-18">00:15:18</a>]  pretty amazing. Yeah, but if you're born in a place where I don't know middle of Southern

[<a id="00-15-25">00:15:25</a>]  Germany with small town. Zurich. Or it's not this is an international city. Ish. You're

[<a id="00-15-34">00:15:34</a>]  not deprived but like I got too many of my American friends sometimes they go different

[<a id="00-15-41">00:15:41</a>]  parts of the world they think they're racism like no believe me they don't really think

[<a id="00-15-45">00:15:45</a>]  about you. You just I don't know your place you can't assume I can't even assume like

[<a id="00-15-51">00:15:51</a>]  they were being rude to me because it might be proper behavior in that part of the world,

[<a id="00-15-55">00:15:55</a>]  you know what I mean? Yeah. And I never found French people rude at all. Matter of fact

[<a id="00-15-59">00:15:59</a>]  I thought they were very straightforward you know and or when some Americans would go like

[<a id="00-16-06">00:16:06</a>]  wow like Tony Hinchcliffe in one of the trigonometry thing he was shocked that the Europeans kept

[<a id="00-16-13">00:16:13</a>]  their eggs outside not in a refrigerator or when you order some way they do it different

[<a id="00-16-19">00:16:19</a>]  from Americans I think stuff like that American get NC some of them it's kind of threatening

[<a id="00-16-26">00:16:26</a>]  why do you think that is I think they don't like anything that's different from their

[<a id="00-16-30">00:16:30</a>]  kind of they feel like it's been challenged and but it's a wrong way to look at it I just

[<a id="00-16-34">00:16:34</a>]  see like oh it's a different way and sometimes they do things better so that classic scene

[<a id="00-16-40">00:16:40</a>]  in Pulp Fiction where they're talking about the burgers yeah yeah so it's just different

[<a id="00-16-45">00:16:45</a>]  and like you shouldn't you shouldn't you shouldn't see them like a threat like I don't know which

[<a id="00-16-49">00:16:49</a>]  city I was in maybe it was in Geneva I really love this about it Switzerland when you take

[<a id="00-16-56">00:16:56</a>]  public transportation you have to get half a ticket for your pet that shit makes me laugh

[<a id="00-17-01">00:17:01</a>]  have you seen it yeah you have the dog ticket yeah I don't know why black dogs have to pay

[<a id="00-17-06">00:17:06</a>]  less than the white dogs but you know that's your country right I don't I don't find these

[<a id="00-17-14">00:17:14</a>]  things because I just think oh that's a different way to do things you know sometimes I have

[<a id="00-17-19">00:17:19</a>]  to figure out like I don't I hate I hate it when I go to airport in Europe like you don't

[<a id="00-17-26">00:17:26</a>]  know right away what you get you have to wait until they'll tell you later one you know if

[<a id="00-17-30">00:17:30</a>]  that's not the case in the USA soon as you check in you know exactly what which gate

[<a id="00-17-34">00:17:34</a>]  to go you know I'm talking like you have to wait like I don't have like okay well tell

[<a id="00-17-38">00:17:38</a>]  me maybe has something to do with security I have no idea but so I just got to remind

[<a id="00-17-47">00:17:47</a>]  myself like look we don't do everything right like even last month and a half when you guys

[<a id="00-17-53">00:17:53</a>]  are telling me how they train and prepare young people I have to say Europeans do it

[<a id="00-17-58">00:17:58</a>]  very quite well that college is not the only way college is fine if that's what you want

[<a id="00-18-04">00:18:04</a>]  to do but if you're going because your parents force you to or because you don't want to

[<a id="00-18-09">00:18:09</a>]  man that is a very expensive thing to do you know but working in apprenticeship I don't

[<a id="00-18-15">00:18:15</a>]  know this is I don't know why we don't do it we only have a prep this whether I say

[<a id="00-18-21">00:18:21</a>]  yesterday we have apprenticeship for like drug dealing being prostitute or making future

[<a id="00-18-28">00:18:28</a>]  US president yes that's but the so I mean interesting you're certainly right when traveling

[<a id="00-18-35">00:18:35</a>]  it does something to your brain like it's like if you're spending if I know sometimes

[<a id="00-18-40">00:18:40</a>]  I've been home too much and then you travel somewhere and it you just feel better it's

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  like a fun but but now I've got a name for this podcast because what you're telling us

[<a id="00-18-52">00:18:52</a>]  about you know you're traveling all over during covert talking to people this podcast is diary

[<a id="00-18-57">00:18:57</a>]  of a super spreader like yeah but the Asian man that traveled to every single stage during

[<a id="00-19-05">00:19:05</a>]  COVID so can I also tell you I have a friend and cool I can't really say anything to some

[<a id="00-19-19">00:19:19</a>]  of my friends wives because I don't agree with a lot of things they say but I can't

[<a id="00-19-24">00:19:24</a>]  really say anything because if I do I don't lose my friendship with my friends right so

[<a id="00-19-29">00:19:29</a>]  I have to keep my mouth shut but a lot of times they really bug me because they think

[<a id="00-19-36">00:19:36</a>]  they're open minded but they're not open minded because I think a lot of them not only they

[<a id="00-19-40">00:19:40</a>]  don't travel physically but they don't travel mentally you know in other words that's an

[<a id="00-19-45">00:19:45</a>]  interesting one because I think even if you can travel to places you could still read

[<a id="00-19-51">00:19:51</a>]  a book but it's what I call A to Z when you read stuff online algorithm right there just

[<a id="00-19-59">00:19:59</a>]  keep feeding the same shit that you want to read but when I say A to Z when I go when

[<a id="00-20-03">00:20:03</a>]  I used to go to library I still go to library when I can but you go A to Z magazine section

[<a id="00-20-07">00:20:07</a>]  you just read all the magazine from every magazine available the whole place I'll spend

[<a id="00-20-13">00:20:13</a>]  hours you know like and because sometimes like I don't know anything about wedding I don't

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  know anything mechanic but I just kind of force myself to look at things that I have

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  no idea even though my retention might be low maybe I don't know what's what I'm reading

[<a id="00-20-26">00:20:26</a>]  but it's better to expose yourself to stuff that you don't know and to idea that maybe

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  you don't agree with you know I think that's the whole point but you can't you can't do

[<a id="00-20-36">00:20:36</a>]  that with a lot of people but some travel is kind of like designed that way right like

[<a id="00-20-40">00:20:40</a>]  you have families that buy like these package holidays right yeah in Europe what's the coast

[<a id="00-20-49">00:20:49</a>]  that they're being sent to Spain or Egypt or whatever yeah all the genetic Italy for

[<a id="00-20-54">00:20:54</a>]  Italy yeah and but all the experience that you're getting I just have this memory I went

[<a id="00-21-01">00:21:01</a>]  to one of those package holidays at one point in you had to what no it was kind of was a

[<a id="00-21-06">00:21:06</a>]  girlfriend or something yeah it was my fiance at the time yeah and it was kind of what you

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  did we had like a nice holiday in Tunisia in a hotel at the beach blah blah blah day

[<a id="00-21-19">00:21:19</a>]  you get fed by the hotel you don't really need leave the complex they found Star Wars

[<a id="00-21-23">00:21:23</a>]  there yeah we have not seen any of Tunisia yeah to be perfectly honest they could have

[<a id="00-21-29">00:21:29</a>]  had a murder behind the hotel yeah I would have not seen it it's you're so secluded from

[<a id="00-21-34">00:21:34</a>]  the rest of anything yeah and then you basically say like oh I was in Tunisia no fucking word

[<a id="00-21-39">00:21:39</a>]  you were in a hotel you were in a hotel so you know exactly what I'm talking about yes

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  and that was not experiencing the country and this leads me to something here higher

[<a id="00-21-51">00:21:51</a>]  I find it fascinating how you travel yeah because you you don't meander from place to

[<a id="00-21-59">00:21:59</a>]  place to go and experience it you're chasing the crime so when whenever you go to places

[<a id="00-22-07">00:22:07</a>]  you have a story about like oh yeah this is where X and Y murder happened and that was

[<a id="00-22-13">00:22:13</a>]  probably a murder the X and Y murder you went to the house where Ghislaine hung out yeah

[<a id="00-22-20">00:22:20</a>]  all these sort of things why why do you want to go to the World Economic Forum like we

[<a id="00-22-29">00:22:29</a>]  we've touched on this before but I want to understand the why I'm growing up growing

[<a id="00-22-39">00:22:39</a>]  up well like when you're growing up poor you don't know you're poor because everybody's

[<a id="00-22-46">00:22:46</a>]  poor in your neighborhood right yeah true and there were several occasion when I was

[<a id="00-22-51">00:22:51</a>]  growing up my dad will take me to places right and I was just stunned yet the level of wealth

[<a id="00-22-59">00:22:59</a>]  and this opportunity that these kids had you know and I don't blame them either you know

[<a id="00-23-04">00:23:04</a>]  but I just didn't understand why some people are just poor is it because they're bad people

[<a id="00-23-11">00:23:11</a>]  and why some people are middle class and like this small group of people are so wealthy

[<a id="00-23-15">00:23:15</a>]  you know and over the over the years I have met I remember I remember that giving college

[<a id="00-23-23">00:23:23</a>]  I remember this kid you know we were talking oh so what are you going to do the winter

[<a id="00-23-29">00:23:29</a>]  break you know that this was like I'm going Whistler this one is going to some like some

[<a id="00-23-36">00:23:36</a>]  fancy ski resort in Switzerland I didn't know where the hell Switzerland meant you know and

[<a id="00-23-41">00:23:41</a>]  this one is going to Jackson Hole something like that in other words saying like they're

[<a id="00-23-46">00:23:46</a>]  going to Palm Beach like what's I mean I don't know any of these things right and like I'm

[<a id="00-23-52">00:23:52</a>]  just taking mental note and and then you know I'm just doing a bunch of shitty jobs taking

[<a id="00-24-01">00:24:01</a>]  care of my family business or whatever you know it's just it's just hey that didn't make

[<a id="00-24-07">00:24:07</a>]  me sad but like wow well how come they get to do this shit and like I'm stuck with this

[<a id="00-24-11">00:24:11</a>]  you know ghetto shit you know then I think I read also in seventh grade I read Charles

[<a id="00-24-20">00:24:20</a>]  Dickens Great Expectation and it's a story I don't know if you guys remember I don't

[<a id="00-24-25">00:24:25</a>]  know if you read it but it's basically this kid in a impoverished situation and he helped

[<a id="00-24-30">00:24:30</a>]  his convict and many years later he fell in love with this girl but he's a poor kid so

[<a id="00-24-35">00:24:35</a>]  there's nothing he could do and then eventually he found opportunity became wealthy and that's

[<a id="00-24-40">00:24:40</a>]  the way I remember but I stuff like that was fascinating me like that that how the poor

[<a id="00-24-47">00:24:47</a>]  live and how difficult to get out and it doesn't matter what poor area I've been to all over

[<a id="00-24-55">00:24:55</a>]  the world there's always that similar smell in the poor neighborhood you know like the

[<a id="00-25-00">00:25:00</a>]  smell of public urine it's like a common thing and that the simple things like when you get

[<a id="00-25-05">00:25:05</a>]  out of the railroad track when you go to poor area how little advertisements available in

[<a id="00-25-09">00:25:09</a>]  poor neighborhood versus richer have to this luxurious advertisement for rich people things

[<a id="00-25-15">00:25:15</a>]  like that and the way poor people live lack of health care and just even like my mother

[<a id="00-25-22">00:25:22</a>]  ridicule me for reading books you know like that's just like a poor person ridicule somebody

[<a id="00-25-27">00:25:27</a>]  for reading books you know and my dad heavily encouraged me that but I think this humiliation

[<a id="00-25-34">00:25:34</a>]  that people experience being poor and that these are decent people you know and it really

[<a id="00-25-40">00:25:40</a>]  bothered me and when I went to college that's one of the reason why I was reading a lot

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  of books about economics and things like that and I went to every green state college practically

[<a id="00-25-49">00:25:49</a>]  a fucking communist campus you know this is the campus where they had an incident with

[<a id="00-25-53">00:25:53</a>]  a day without a white people is it brett weinstein yeah so he said no this is a racist so you

[<a id="00-26-02">00:26:02</a>]  know I went to that school and then I was there before he was professor there but dude

[<a id="00-26-06">00:26:06</a>]  I didn't know any of this like communist thinking I mean I've heard people saying anti-communist

[<a id="00-26-12">00:26:12</a>]  my family anti-communist but I didn't realize how cancerous Marxism was you know so like

[<a id="00-26-21">00:26:21</a>]  like you were saying I go to tragic places but one of my favorite place was Manchester

[<a id="00-26-26">00:26:26</a>]  UK and ironically my hometown Osaka and especially my neighborhood Taishoku it's called like

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  the Manchester Japan because there's a lot of manufacturing and I remember my grandfather

[<a id="00-26-40">00:26:40</a>]  was missing two or three fingers because industrial injury and things like that but there's no

[<a id="00-26-45">00:26:45</a>]  recourse you lose your arm and legs you know you're fucked there's there's nothing they're

[<a id="00-26-49">00:26:49</a>]  going to do about beyond that you know so in Manchester there was this library quick

[<a id="00-26-54">00:26:54</a>]  question what took you to Manchester what why why were you in Manchester there was a

[<a id="00-26-59">00:26:59</a>]  serial killer talk in Liverpool but I but I also went to Manchester because a couple

[<a id="00-27-05">00:27:05</a>]  things and they were they were close to each other cluster of things I was into Manchester

[<a id="00-27-12">00:27:12</a>]  that terrorist attack at that stadium was right by the library and that particular I

[<a id="00-27-18">00:27:18</a>]  forgot the name of the library but I went in and there was this table in the back row

[<a id="00-27-21">00:27:21</a>]  that's where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engel was talking during the whole injustice in

[<a id="00-27-28">00:27:28</a>]  industrial England I can't believe I'm in that room where these motherfuckers were having

[<a id="00-27-34">00:27:34</a>]  discussion okay Friedrich Engel was a very rich kid his father was rich and he was able

[<a id="00-27-40">00:27:40</a>]  to help Karl write this book but that's capital and things like that right so so here I am

[<a id="00-27-47">00:27:47</a>]  and I did the exact measurement exactly to 199.9 miles away is Adam Smith grave where

[<a id="00-27-59">00:27:59</a>]  wealth of nation was written in Edinburgh right so you're talking about about 200 miles

[<a id="00-28-07">00:28:07</a>]  two guys two opposing ideas influence the rest of fucking world you know you could say

[<a id="00-28-14">00:28:14</a>]  whatever you want but Karl more than 100 years yeah and it's still I mean Marxism is live

[<a id="00-28-20">00:28:20</a>]  you know is the whole idea is to divide people so whether it's BLM or feminism or environmental

[<a id="00-28-28">00:28:28</a>]  because the whole idea they don't really care about the goal it's just they they need some

[<a id="00-28-33">00:28:33</a>]  subject matter to divide people I'm not sure that's Marxism but well you know that I think

[<a id="00-28-40">00:28:40</a>]  in that case identity politics but it's divided and rule that's the Romans came out of that

[<a id="00-28-46">00:28:46</a>]  it's I think it's Hegel who came up with the whole idea a dialectic right that what is

[<a id="00-28-51">00:28:51</a>]  it this is antithesis synthesis so you have a two opposing idea you know you you this

[<a id="00-28-58">00:28:58</a>]  is like many of the Soviet thing where they want to disrupt any country to go in and create

[<a id="00-29-04">00:29:04</a>]  problems make sure people are divided by each other you know it's very effective you know

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  so so to me Marxism is a type of cancer so if you want to say look I could be wrong but

[<a id="00-29-19">00:29:19</a>]  there is a place for feminism I'm not sure about these radical feminism you know there's

[<a id="00-29-23">00:29:23</a>]  place environmentalism but I don't know about these environmental group that commit terrorist

[<a id="00-29-28">00:29:28</a>]  attack and things like that you know there's a place for a lot of thing but when I went

[<a id="00-29-33">00:29:33</a>]  to Evergreen State College that's that was the thing that learned like Evergreen Reed

[<a id="00-29-38">00:29:38</a>]  in Oregon a lot of them reappear in 1999 WTO at Seattle I went there my room and I thought

[<a id="00-29-49">00:29:49</a>]  we were smoking so much we looked like fun it was not fun when you get there you're talking

[<a id="00-29-54">00:29:54</a>]  about forty fifty sixty thousand sixty thousand people angry but they're all angry for different

[<a id="00-29-59">00:29:59</a>]  reasons environmental issues child labor you know like against the NAFTA so this it was

[<a id="00-30-06">00:30:06</a>]  like a swarm of bees but they were different kind of bees angry about things but they just

[<a id="00-30-12">00:30:12</a>]  united you know and I've never seen anything like that you know so that made me think like

[<a id="00-30-17">00:30:17</a>]  whatever notion I had about the world it's probably wrong it still is wrong so only way

[<a id="00-30-22">00:30:22</a>]  I could dispel a little bit of that's actually going to those places now you guys are right

[<a id="00-30-27">00:30:27</a>]  I should spend more time but a lot of times the reason I go this random places and a very

[<a id="00-30-32">00:30:32</a>]  short time because I don't really have a resource to stay long time so whatever the twelve sixteen

[<a id="00-30-37">00:30:37</a>]  hours I have I'm going to maximize it so like is it is it is that it's a good dance called

[<a id="00-30-45">00:30:45</a>]  dance Poland I don't know you say it dancing dance no no I was using the old German name

[<a id="00-30-53">00:30:53</a>]  oh how do you say it dancing don't ever use that's why you're done okay yeah I went there

[<a id="00-31-05">00:31:05</a>]  just go to Poland I was for dancing is that a German way of saying it yeah so all these

[<a id="00-31-14">00:31:14</a>]  towns up at the northern border to the northern sea with the Finnish Baltic Sea the Baltic

[<a id="00-31-24">00:31:24</a>]  Sea they had German names okay it was Prussia yes for a long time yeah until 1871 with the

[<a id="00-31-34">00:31:34</a>]  Franco-Prussian war yeah and I wanted to go there I only had it I was figuring out how

[<a id="00-31-42">00:31:42</a>]  do I get out of Moldova visit after going to Kiev and leaving Kiev and I was trying

[<a id="00-31-47">00:31:47</a>]  to figure out so many different way of leaving but it's a factor things like the cost time

[<a id="00-31-55">00:31:55</a>]  but also which one gives me the most interesting route getting out and then once I have found

[<a id="00-32-01">00:32:01</a>]  bunch of different exit is there a way for me to leave from the airport from those places

[<a id="00-32-07">00:32:07</a>]  to someplace interesting and I did a couple hours and I to me most optimal was go there

[<a id="00-32-13">00:32:13</a>]  and fly out of there to Sweden to visit my friend and I was always interested in that

[<a id="00-32-17">00:32:17</a>]  city because I'm old enough to remember in 1989 fucking solidarity where the protests

[<a id="00-32-22">00:32:22</a>]  so I went there at port and I'm just walking out and I know to young people it doesn't

[<a id="00-32-28">00:32:28</a>]  mean anything but in my head I could just hear the sounds deal because I was listening

[<a id="00-32-33">00:32:33</a>]  to TV because I like reading history and things like that so I'm just walking and closing

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  my arm thinking my luck of Elsa Wilson that he's the labor you know but yeah I remember

[<a id="00-32-46">00:32:46</a>]  that guy giving a speech at that at the time I was thinking like they're gonna fucking

[<a id="00-32-50">00:32:50</a>]  kill that guy you know that's what I thought but boy I was wrong because the forces of

[<a id="00-32-55">00:32:55</a>]  history you could never predict what what happened right because I think my impression

[<a id="00-33-01">00:33:01</a>]  was they could kill them but it's a bit too harsh and the repercussion would be terrible

[<a id="00-33-08">00:33:08</a>]  so they didn't do it but because they didn't do anything it was their downfall you know

[<a id="00-33-13">00:33:13</a>]  and I'm watching this like you know and I remember the German Prime Minister at the

[<a id="00-33-18">00:33:18</a>]  time saying the Berlin Wall will never gonna come down next day it went down so just show

[<a id="00-33-22">00:33:22</a>]  like nobody knows yeah yeah I definitely don't know now everyone just takes their best takes

[<a id="00-33-28">00:33:28</a>]  your best guess but I have no idea but I mean there might be some dude in the CIA go well

[<a id="00-33-33">00:33:33</a>]  you guys don't know I want to dial it back to my original question is like you all these

[<a id="00-33-44">00:33:44</a>]  places and the various different experiences that you have the way that you're experiencing

[<a id="00-33-51">00:33:51</a>]  these cities etc why the World Economic Forum oh because I think okay so when you have when

[<a id="00-34-03">00:34:03</a>]  you have a Nobel Prize you know you have different Nobel Prize for physics and literature and

[<a id="00-34-08">00:34:08</a>]  things like that but there's only one thing for social science which is economics right

[<a id="00-34-12">00:34:12</a>]  and I remember taking econ class but also I grew up in it also debatably not a science

[<a id="00-34-19">00:34:19</a>]  well some people might quite hard but yeah I mean the great thing about economics is

[<a id="00-34-26">00:34:26</a>]  that actually 95 percent of time they agree it's just when they don't agree in that five

[<a id="00-34-31">00:34:31</a>]  percent you know what that's when the model is wrong no no it's just okay simple things

[<a id="00-34-39">00:34:39</a>]  like if you put a hundred dollar tax each gallon of gas way less people gonna buy obviously

[<a id="00-34-45">00:34:45</a>]  you know now whether that's good or bad depends if you talk to environmentally person like

[<a id="00-34-49">00:34:49</a>]  said that might be good so those opinions they might agree but all trade-offs but if

[<a id="00-34-54">00:34:54</a>]  you put hundred dollars tax for each gallon gas everybody will probably agree that less

[<a id="00-35-00">00:35:00</a>]  people buy it because they can't afford to that so so the part that they agree it's not

[<a id="00-35-05">00:35:05</a>]  a news it's the disagreement when people think like it's a dismal science what that right

[<a id="00-35-11">00:35:11</a>]  but I remember living in military base it they told me stuff about the danger of inflation

[<a id="00-35-17">00:35:17</a>]  you know and inflation is a friend of dictators because you know you imagine if you're this

[<a id="00-35-22">00:35:22</a>]  happening in China too but in Germany where inflation went so fast and if you're old person

[<a id="00-35-29">00:35:29</a>]  you have a monthly exact pension is you know you're terrified because every month your money's

[<a id="00-35-35">00:35:35</a>]  worth less whoever that asshole that promised you to fix everything you're going to vote

[<a id="00-35-40">00:35:40</a>]  for that person well you know the rest of the story what happened to shortly China and

[<a id="00-35-43">00:35:43</a>]  things like that so I think I learned early on that these things are really really important

[<a id="00-35-48">00:35:48</a>]  and for poor people they suffer because of that you know so I think war economic form

[<a id="00-35-56">00:35:56</a>]  I was wrong about a couple things because I think I appreciate you you know correcting

[<a id="00-36-00">00:36:00</a>]  things you know and I thought I really I don't want to think I don't want to see work I can

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  I'm a phone like that like evil it's wrong to think that you know this remember I don't

[<a id="00-36-14">00:36:14</a>]  know the exact the definition of deep state but even Eric Snowden was part of it he tried

[<a id="00-36-18">00:36:18</a>]  to do the right thing by saying US government was doing the wrong thing so good people are

[<a id="00-36-23">00:36:23</a>]  everywhere including wedding world economic foreign outside of it just like there's good

[<a id="00-36-28">00:36:28</a>]  people in deep state you know but I think I hate seeing people suffer because they live

[<a id="00-36-33">00:36:33</a>]  in a poor country they can't get out of the country they're suffering from corruption

[<a id="00-36-37">00:36:37</a>]  which is to me economic version of STD but see here's here's the puzzle I've got so you

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  took for example you said in Manchester you went to where come on yeah you're at his table

[<a id="00-36-49">00:36:49</a>]  yeah and you go to the world economic from I've seen the pictures you put on Instagram

[<a id="00-36-53">00:36:53</a>]  it'll be like this wall behind this wall was where this surrogate like and get for me for

[<a id="00-37-00">00:37:00</a>]  me like I don't get the value in that like if you actually I mean I mean the way you're

[<a id="00-37-07">00:37:07</a>]  describing going to the world economic yeah it's like we've got this super Asian analyst

[<a id="00-37-11">00:37:11</a>]  that we're sending but in fact we've got a retard that's going well what is it like tangibly

[<a id="00-37-18">00:37:18</a>]  what do you get from walking around the world economic form because you're not going to

[<a id="00-37-22">00:37:22</a>]  get into any of the big talks or no I'm not going to get this I'm not going to get this

[<a id="00-37-26">00:37:26</a>]  big the talk that that is true but maybe this is not true in Europe maybe this is not true

[<a id="00-37-34">00:37:34</a>]  in Europe but where I come from in North America sex is it's not something kosher to talk about

[<a id="00-37-46">00:37:46</a>]  we pretend like it's not a factor but I do think it's a factor how people behave and

[<a id="00-37-52">00:37:52</a>]  I think sometimes I don't think it's surprised to you that some CEOs are psychopath and sometimes

[<a id="00-37-59">00:37:59</a>]  they behave because some of the decisions are not necessary for economic reasons it's

[<a id="00-38-04">00:38:04</a>]  mostly sexual reasons you know and fucking over masses of people by doing terrible things

[<a id="00-38-10">00:38:10</a>]  I mean it seemed like it was clear what Bernie made up so because I work in sex business

[<a id="00-38-16">00:38:16</a>]  and and I don't I never had a pedigree education I never had access to boarding school and

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  things like that I've only I've only see through jobs I had in sex world use that as a lens

[<a id="00-38-31">00:38:31</a>]  to see what's going on world and I think I mean I have no evidence for any of it but

[<a id="00-38-37">00:38:37</a>]  I think what happened border starts in the bedroom you know what happened in war room

[<a id="00-38-42">00:38:42</a>]  something sexual I mean there's a famous story about Napoleon catching Josephine cheating

[<a id="00-38-48">00:38:48</a>]  on he got so upset boy did he punish the French and Austrian army he was vicious the Austerlitz

[<a id="00-38-55">00:38:55</a>]  that's like one of the that's a devil's in the movie too he was brilliant brilliant but

[<a id="00-38-59">00:38:59</a>]  he was vicious too and then I think you know people like that when they're angry sexual

[<a id="00-39-04">00:39:04</a>]  frustration they're gonna take it on something so so you look in so so I go I went to I sneak

[<a id="00-39-10">00:39:10</a>]  into some of those hotel rooms not hotel room hotels wow they're fucking no no no not even

[<a id="00-39-19">00:39:19</a>]  I went to the hotel you know when there's collection of Chinese and Japanese delegate

[<a id="00-39-24">00:39:24</a>]  I just kind of walk in behind them so that's how I got in I mean maybe maybe I could've

[<a id="00-39-29">00:39:29</a>]  got in but I didn't I never have like Christian seemed very comfortable in those professional

[<a id="00-39-37">00:39:37</a>]  surroundings because I don't have that I mean I did a little bit of bookkeeping but I never

[<a id="00-39-41">00:39:41</a>]  felt comfortable and I think you in a professional surrounding it were all economic foreign you

[<a id="00-39-46">00:39:46</a>]  looked apart you know how to behave it's like throwing a fish in the ocean I'm not a fish

[<a id="00-39-52">00:39:52</a>]  in that regard I would drown in those social surrounding now room for perverts and pimps

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  and like registered sex offender yeah I'm very comfortable in those situations the only

[<a id="00-40-02">00:40:02</a>]  different with those registered sex offenders that they're poor and they never had a way

[<a id="00-40-06">00:40:06</a>]  to get out of the situation but believe me there's plenty of those fucking perverts and

[<a id="00-40-09">00:40:09</a>]  work in that form not all but there's some of them of course they so I want to go and

[<a id="00-40-14">00:40:14</a>]  see them in person are you able so would you say when you are you able to like from looking

[<a id="00-40-20">00:40:20</a>]  at body language stuff like this you know what's going on with someone I don't I don't

[<a id="00-40-26">00:40:26</a>]  want to say I'm an expert but you know the neighborhood that grow up there was so much

[<a id="00-40-31">00:40:31</a>]  sex workers I didn't know what that was so I just assumed everyone was like that and

[<a id="00-40-35">00:40:35</a>]  of course when you go to a neighborhood like oh people really don't behave like that you

[<a id="00-40-39">00:40:39</a>]  know that's not the part of Japan most people see but you know I was like mile and a half

[<a id="00-40-44">00:40:44</a>]  away from one of the biggest red light district but there's a lot of sex workers in my neighborhood

[<a id="00-40-48">00:40:48</a>]  you know and I and plus you know when you're young you go public bath I grew up seeing

[<a id="00-40-55">00:40:55</a>]  adults both men and women naked so I thought that was normal but when I moved to United

[<a id="00-41-00">00:41:00</a>]  States quickly I learned like no you this is a bad thing you know so I had to relearn

[<a id="00-41-04">00:41:04</a>]  everything you know like why you know my my friends who work in New York City BDSM a lot

[<a id="00-41-15">00:41:15</a>]  of their clients are very high power business people in Wall Street things like that you

[<a id="00-41-21">00:41:21</a>]  I think the thinking is they're always telling people what to do they get sick of doing that

[<a id="00-41-25">00:41:25</a>]  so they want to take a break where they're being told what once you know that's interesting

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  you said something before that fascinates me in terms of like you've been to the World

[<a id="00-41-34">00:41:34</a>]  Economic Forum now twice right no no just once that was the one time yeah and you changed

[<a id="00-41-40">00:41:40</a>]  your opinion about it not only based on the conversations that we had but also the experience

[<a id="00-41-46">00:41:46</a>]  that you had before you went all that thought you just made me maybe remember okay don't

[<a id="00-41-53">00:41:53</a>]  forget what you're saying Milton Freeman talk about this once how amazing pencils are because

[<a id="00-41-59">00:41:59</a>]  one individual cannot make them so you need rubber from Brazil you have to have wood from

[<a id="00-42-04">00:42:04</a>]  Canada you have to have to paint you know you have so many different parts of the world

[<a id="00-42-11">00:42:11</a>]  come to this one thing to make a pencil making pencil individualism what's impossible now

[<a id="00-42-16">00:42:16</a>]  imagine well imagine if I poke your eyes with it right it's not pencil's fault or none of

[<a id="00-42-24">00:42:24</a>]  the people making pencil was part of that attack on you so you're right there's plenty

[<a id="00-42-29">00:42:29</a>]  people in Virginia and DC are decent Americans they don't know what part they're playing

[<a id="00-42-37">00:42:37</a>]  in the overall picture what the US government's doing so yeah you're right there's a lot of

[<a id="00-42-41">00:42:41</a>]  good people but they're also part of the problem problem but how would you know do you know

[<a id="00-42-46">00:42:46</a>]  what I'm trying to say here like pencil is not the problem it took a lot of different

[<a id="00-42-50">00:42:50</a>]  people to make it if I choose to stand believe me sometime you deserve it Harry but yeah

[<a id="00-42-55">00:42:55</a>]  but but but I'm talking butt plugs yes they have a different purpose like how many people

[<a id="00-43-02">00:43:02</a>]  do you reckon it needs to build a butt plug I mean nowadays they get more and more because

[<a id="00-43-07">00:43:07</a>]  you got internet connected sex toys like that's already at this level you need the nerds to

[<a id="00-43-13">00:43:13</a>]  make the CPU people are putting CPUs in the hole and just like let's say you you work

[<a id="00-43-18">00:43:18</a>]  in Hollywood a different entertainment business right and most of the people are not doing

[<a id="00-43-23">00:43:23</a>]  anything terrible but anybody who was part of Nickelodeon early 2000 there's clearly

[<a id="00-43-28">00:43:28</a>]  abuse and inappropriate behavior toward kids now can I categorize all show business of

[<a id="00-43-35">00:43:35</a>]  course not a guy who is a security at the Nickelodeon studio it's not a problem I've

[<a id="00-43-39">00:43:39</a>]  got a lady working at the county writing checks that's just not a problem but within the organization

[<a id="00-43-45">00:43:45</a>]  something bad was happening right something rotten yeah so that's that's why I'm trying

[<a id="00-43-49">00:43:49</a>]  not to be too critical but work and important is important they're definitely influence

[<a id="00-43-57">00:43:57</a>]  for the rest of the world right and like even this example that he brilliantly explained

[<a id="00-44-03">00:44:03</a>]  to me it never occurred to me reason why Elon Musk he doesn't want to touch any his ass

[<a id="00-44-09">00:44:09</a>]  it he get loans from banks if and and you told me this example where it's inconvenient

[<a id="00-44-15">00:44:15</a>]  if he have to go New York to get a loan they say no now I gotta go to Chicago yeah you want

[<a id="00-44-20">00:44:20</a>]  to go doubles all the bankers are there or at least the one that matters right yeah the

[<a id="00-44-24">00:44:24</a>]  one that matters yeah so these things are really interesting because poor people don't

[<a id="00-44-29">00:44:29</a>]  know why they're poor they don't know how to get out of it and that's why they only believe

[<a id="00-44-32">00:44:32</a>]  in conspiracy or you know they have a misguided notion how economics work justify their own

[<a id="00-44-40">00:44:40</a>]  existence but let me ask you this then again like let me ask you a question yeah let's

[<a id="00-44-47">00:44:47</a>]  let's try that in that vein before you went to the World Economic Forum the first time

[<a id="00-44-54">00:44:54</a>]  yeah you had a notion of what it was yeah so you had an idea yeah what was that idea what

[<a id="00-45-00">00:45:00</a>]  did you think that it is I was little I'm not sure I gotta think what I what I thought

[<a id="00-45-12">00:45:12</a>]  because people tell me all the conspiracy stuff and I don't really know that stuff like

[<a id="00-45-19">00:45:19</a>]  don't you know this group did this man like I have no idea but I thought I think maybe

[<a id="00-45-26">00:45:26</a>]  I was naive like if you were asking 10-15 years ago is probably what's important organization

[<a id="00-45-30">00:45:30</a>]  to eliminate poverty and problems in the world that's that's what you would have thought

[<a id="00-45-37">00:45:37</a>]  10-15 years ago because I'm testing the marketing department yeah but when I took my first econ

[<a id="00-45-50">00:45:50</a>]  this was in McCord Air Force so I was taking classes at McCord Air Force yes back in the

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  early 90s they had this loophole where well when you move to different states you have

[<a id="00-46-00">00:46:00</a>]  to wait a year before you pay state resident for tuitions right so I had to wait a year

[<a id="00-46-05">00:46:05</a>]  then somebody told me at my mom's restaurant because we have a lot of military people oh

[<a id="00-46-09">00:46:09</a>]  you could take classes of Fort Lewis of McCord and you pay like a state tuition like really

[<a id="00-46-15">00:46:15</a>]  so I went and it sure enough it's one of those loopholes because they have a lot of military

[<a id="00-46-19">00:46:19</a>]  people and when I took the econ this guy really changed my life right and and I thought accounting

[<a id="00-46-29">00:46:29</a>]  is going to be difficult and econ is going to be difficult and accounting is easy econ

[<a id="00-46-34">00:46:34</a>]  is difficult I find out my personality it was other way around and to me econ is like

[<a id="00-46-39">00:46:39</a>]  way of thinking you know and this guy really changed my mind and I became love with that

[<a id="00-46-45">00:46:45</a>]  subject matter you know and I think the one I was possessed is what they call Chicago

[<a id="00-46-51">00:46:51</a>]  boys University oh yeah yeah so guys like Milton Freeman and other professors there

[<a id="00-46-59">00:46:59</a>]  and post Vienna yeah and I think they were I couldn't believe I got into it because it

[<a id="00-47-06">00:47:06</a>]  makes sense to me but the problem is when you study too much econ it's like it's almost

[<a id="00-47-14">00:47:14</a>]  like dark material to explain maybe explain this a little bit because that's also that's

[<a id="00-47-20">00:47:20</a>]  not just economics as a lot of people think about it this is we are talking macroeconomics

[<a id="00-47-25">00:47:25</a>]  here yeah Milton Freeman was a famous for his Nobel Prize in 75 or 76 on monetary policy

[<a id="00-47-32">00:47:32</a>]  and he make argument the reason why depression got terrible instead of making the money available

[<a id="00-47-38">00:47:38</a>]  to expand economy they tight the flow of money and it created even more problems you know

[<a id="00-47-45">00:47:45</a>]  so he think it's better not to have a Federal Reserve chairman but have a computer making

[<a id="00-47-51">00:47:51</a>]  gradual flow of money more or less to control interest rate if I remember right think like

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  US economy like an oil tanker now if the recession is like iceberg like Titanic you're too late

[<a id="00-48-05">00:48:05</a>]  if you want to anticipate what's going to have economies like oil tank you have to make

[<a id="00-48-08">00:48:08</a>]  a gradual change far distance ahead of time right it's so enormous you cannot make a quick

[<a id="00-48-14">00:48:14</a>]  change you know so the changes can be really small to have a major effect for the exactly

[<a id="00-48-18">00:48:18</a>]  same reason yeah so a change in the interest rates can have a fundamental change in direction

[<a id="00-48-24">00:48:24</a>]  of where the economy goes right and when I read those books like it really changed my

[<a id="00-48-28">00:48:28</a>]  mind because I didn't think I would like this shit and like you just don't know what you're

[<a id="00-48-32">00:48:32</a>]  interested in you know so I read those books and and it's part of the reason I got obsessed

[<a id="00-48-41">00:48:41</a>]  with Buttman John Stalliano because he is the intersection of the thing that was interesting

[<a id="00-48-49">00:48:49</a>]  last 25 years John Stalliano he went to UCLA he was studying theater and dance and the reason

[<a id="00-48-56">00:48:56</a>]  why he was studying dance because most of the classmates are women he likes sitting

[<a id="00-49-01">00:49:01</a>]  in the back of the room looking at their asses all the time but he ended up studying econ

[<a id="00-49-06">00:49:06</a>]  a lot of it too you know and he was donating a lot of money to Cato Institute which is

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  one of the ultra conservative / libertarian and it was created by Koch brothers from Wichita

[<a id="00-49-18">00:49:18</a>]  Kansas where BTK Serial Killer was also from but he was one of the Koch brothers was one

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  of the three founders of Cato Institute and later on they kicked Stalliano out even though

[<a id="00-49-30">00:49:30</a>]  they were libertarian but they were uncomfortable with sex so he went from there to American

[<a id="00-49-36">00:49:36</a>]  Enterprise Institute Reason Magazine things like that so why am I saying this because

[<a id="00-49-40">00:49:40</a>]  John was interested in me because unlike most poor people they're all about fucking John

[<a id="00-49-46">00:49:46</a>]  was very interested in that he was a collision of sex and money and these are like kind of

[<a id="00-49-54">00:49:54</a>]  uncomfortable subject matter and there's only very few people kind of obsessed with both

[<a id="00-49-59">00:49:59</a>]  of them at the level that John's interested in so I like his movies you know like I didn't

[<a id="00-50-05">00:50:05</a>]  know his background but the reason I picked John's movie because I remember for those

[<a id="00-50-12">00:50:12</a>]  of you old enough to remember when you go to mom and pop video store there's a double

[<a id="00-50-16">00:50:16</a>]  door look like a saloon from cowboy days you go in like a cowboy you know those doors that

[<a id="00-50-21">00:50:21</a>]  look like saloons and there's all the porn shit and this is the only reason why mom and

[<a id="00-50-25">00:50:25</a>]  pop video store were able to compete with the big boys because they refused to carry

[<a id="00-50-30">00:50:30</a>]  porn porn is what saved this mom and store shops you know but I went and but there's

[<a id="00-50-36">00:50:36</a>]  so many porn movies like I don't know where to begin I remember seeing Buttman where he

[<a id="00-50-40">00:50:40</a>]  shapes like this and he shaped like like a Batman logo right and I like Batman right

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  so I that's the only reason why I pick up Batman Buttman kind of funny I start watching

[<a id="00-50-53">00:50:53</a>]  and I like his movies you know because I think what I like about was he really is one of

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  the founder of gonzo porn movie truly one of the founders you know it's kind of like

[<a id="00-51-05">00:51:05</a>]  in the literary world stream of consciousness you have James Joyce you have Faulkner you

[<a id="00-51-13">00:51:13</a>]  have all this other people of stream consciousness like Batman is the stream consciousness of

[<a id="00-51-18">00:51:18</a>]  porn where the gonzo thing right where gonzo means just like Hunter S. Thompson's thing

[<a id="00-51-23">00:51:23</a>]  where the person telling the story writing the story is also part of the story yeah so

[<a id="00-51-28">00:51:28</a>]  gonzo porn is where the guy's filming it but it's also part of the story which broke the

[<a id="00-51-34">00:51:34</a>]  tradition from future porn because the only way you're protected by government is if you

[<a id="00-51-39">00:51:39</a>]  have some kind of artistic or literary or academic like a artistic thing in there to

[<a id="00-51-47">00:51:47</a>]  protect you from the US government well there was a case that destroyed all that and John

[<a id="00-51-52">00:51:52</a>]  was the one of the first one to do gonzo porn in fact September 1st 1989 which is the fifth

[<a id="00-51-58">00:51:58</a>]  year anniversary of Germany invading Poland Avengers of Batman was released on that day

[<a id="00-52-04">00:52:04</a>]  right so so that was released it changed the porn business he's an innovator and he also

[<a id="00-52-14">00:52:14</a>]  started a company very different from other porn companies he doesn't own he only owned

[<a id="00-52-18">00:52:18</a>]  movie that he made but when he bring other directors they own their product John only

[<a id="00-52-23">00:52:23</a>]  takes like 10% so idea is director have incentive to make best movies if they make the best

[<a id="00-52-30">00:52:30</a>]  movies they'll sell more they'll make more money and John will make money so John was

[<a id="00-52-35">00:52:35</a>]  doing all kinds of innovative things where he's applying economic thought to pornography

[<a id="00-52-40">00:52:40</a>]  right and I was interested in why poor people live this way and one thing I noticed with

[<a id="00-52-46">00:52:46</a>]  rich people right away my early twenties that they're particularly embarrassed about sexual

[<a id="00-52-54">00:52:54</a>]  things like poor people whatever you know it's not a very culture thing so this is where

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  the rich people are rich and I don't know why they're rich but one weapon I have against

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  them is that the chain and sexual mores is uncomfortable for them you know not that middle

[<a id="00-53-14">00:53:14</a>]  class and poor people comfortable with it but they're really really uncomfortable with

[<a id="00-53-20">00:53:20</a>]  discussing money and sex you know yes and those are the subject matters I thought was

[<a id="00-53-24">00:53:24</a>]  interesting to me and how how they run and also one of the reason why I miss so many

[<a id="00-53-32">00:53:32</a>]  rich people is because pornography through some of the sex workers and porn girls you

[<a id="00-53-36">00:53:36</a>]  know like I just just met a lot of them there's no other circumstance where someone like myself

[<a id="00-53-42">00:53:42</a>]  will meet rich people I mean so that was the conduit to that world and after they have

[<a id="00-53-49">00:53:49</a>]  money and stuff and it's amazing a lot of times they were like a Silicon Valley guys

[<a id="00-53-54">00:53:54</a>]  they really earned they come from modest background I have no resentment you know but but sex

[<a id="00-54-02">00:54:02</a>]  is like a leverage how you deal with them you know so that's why I was kind of interested

[<a id="00-54-08">00:54:08</a>]  in like when I went year and a half ago like oh don't tell me she's your executive assistant

[<a id="00-54-13">00:54:13</a>]  or niece I know how I know a hooker on how they wait you just just like somebody getting

[<a id="00-54-19">00:54:19</a>]  out of prison they have certain walk and there's a something about sex workers you know you

[<a id="00-54-24">00:54:24</a>]  just get out of prison I I don't I don't I don't have to know you went to prison I could

[<a id="00-54-28">00:54:28</a>]  just kill you know and then sex worker certain ways but just like when I went to musicals

[<a id="00-54-36">00:54:36</a>]  and plays there's definitely the upper class than the insurance in London like what I'm

[<a id="00-54-43">00:54:43</a>]  an idiot but I could clearly kill maybe this person doesn't have a money but he or she

[<a id="00-54-48">00:54:48</a>]  have upper class manners and and parents you know you could just tell right away these

[<a id="00-54-53">00:54:53</a>]  are the quite obvious you know I think I mean there's there's two interesting things first

[<a id="00-54-58">00:54:58</a>]  of all I mean what you're saying about John Saliano and letting other producers keep their

[<a id="00-55-04">00:55:04</a>]  keep their material yeah and he's also from Chicago too but that's an interesting because

[<a id="00-55-09">00:55:09</a>]  we have these discussions let's say about comedy scene in Switzerland there's two mindsets

[<a id="00-55-15">00:55:15</a>]  there's this scarcity mindset and abundance mindset and what you're saying is like in

[<a id="00-55-20">00:55:20</a>]  the porn industry it's more like there's a especially when it comes to buts it's like

[<a id="00-55-26">00:55:26</a>]  you've got the scarce that he might say as in us and then you had John Sally he was the

[<a id="00-55-31">00:55:31</a>]  ass-bundance mindset he felt as should be for everyone that was a long set of wow but

[<a id="00-55-38">00:55:38</a>]  look here's how it's working well you know what happened was he he saw a bunch of pornography

[<a id="00-55-43">00:55:43</a>]  he started working for one of the porn guy Bill Margo he passed away recently rest in

[<a id="00-55-48">00:55:48</a>]  peace but he was working for different guys it wasn't going anywhere and he know he knew

[<a id="00-55-52">00:55:52</a>]  he noticed that he like him good Italian boy that he is he like women with nice ass asses

[<a id="00-56-00">00:56:00</a>]  and he noticed that in the marketplace didn't have a lot of movies with focusing on asses

[<a id="00-56-04">00:56:04</a>]  right so he felt like well I'll just do that and it was instant success because as a businessman

[<a id="00-56-12">00:56:12</a>]  there was a need and no one is meeting that meet the demand he met that he made tons of

[<a id="00-56-19">00:56:19</a>]  money and not really a hole in the market yeah so he saw that and I like his movies

[<a id="00-56-30">00:56:30</a>]  and then 97 it just shocked me because whatever notion I had sex I was really really wrong

[<a id="00-56-35">00:56:35</a>]  and it was the beginning of my years both directly indirectly with Sally Anna I learned

[<a id="00-56-41">00:56:41</a>]  about sex business sexuality 97 is the year you know Jonathan how she was HIV positive

[<a id="00-56-49">00:56:49</a>]  and I you know at that blood transfusion or something you know then I find out that he

[<a id="00-56-54">00:56:54</a>]  got it from transgender prostitute sounds like redundant but in Brazil and then it just

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  broke every notion I had because I just thought I didn't have a I don't think I was homophobic

[<a id="00-57-05">00:57:05</a>]  or anything like that but you just have certain idea like oh he's not gay or whatever you

[<a id="00-57-10">00:57:10</a>]  know like but he was looking at a lot of ass yeah maybe as a friend but his okay I've got

[<a id="00-57-17">00:57:17</a>]  so so so that happened it changed my mind about like I don't know what I'm talking about

[<a id="00-57-23">00:57:23</a>]  I should talk to more people I should travel more read more and things are not that obvious

[<a id="00-57-29">00:57:29</a>]  you know and when I worked with him for like nine years I learned a lot especially especially

[<a id="00-57-36">00:57:36</a>]  when I'm working with transgender porn you learn a lot because it's not as obvious what

[<a id="00-57-43">00:57:43</a>]  you're always not looking at something that you're looking at some things and it's not

[<a id="00-57-49">00:57:49</a>]  what it looks like obviously because it's a man appearing to be a woman and you know

[<a id="00-57-55">00:57:55</a>]  so working for him for nine years it was eye-opening experience because every time I had a question

[<a id="00-58-01">00:58:01</a>]  or fantasy John had it you know and other from other directors and other female performer

[<a id="00-58-06">00:58:06</a>]  fit different female performer from different parts of the world it really really expand

[<a id="00-58-10">00:58:10</a>]  my mind like it's a lot more complicated sex is a very complicated thing so I got I mean

[<a id="00-58-17">00:58:17</a>]  you give me a thought it sounds like a viable way of looking at things because if you look

[<a id="00-58-23">00:58:23</a>]  at difference between wealth and poverty and how that plays out like in I think one common

[<a id="00-58-30">00:58:30</a>]  thing amongst poor people yeah is family instability yeah and and if you want to maintain wealth

[<a id="00-58-38">00:58:38</a>]  it's the like like all the things say well the big thing that will guarantee your success

[<a id="00-58-44">00:58:44</a>]  is your parents despite the you know the capitalism whatever you say if you come from a rich family

[<a id="00-58-51">00:58:51</a>]  you get a good education you got taught how to be smart with money from a young age and

[<a id="00-58-57">00:58:57</a>]  that discipline that like the fundamental of that is families have to stay together

[<a id="00-59-03">00:59:03</a>]  now the other side of this is if you say that's not only for rich people I mean you could

[<a id="00-59-07">00:59:07</a>]  be poor and if you have a solid home that's it you're going to have a pretty good future

[<a id="00-59-10">00:59:10</a>]  I think you know yeah yeah but but I think there's a tendency there's let and then it's

[<a id="00-59-17">00:59:17</a>]  like a repetition that goes over generations if you come from a folk family chances are

[<a id="00-59-22">00:59:22</a>]  that either you or your kids will have a folk family yeah and then and then if you look

[<a id="00-59-27">00:59:27</a>]  at the other aspects so that's the one thing but also what you're saying about shame because

[<a id="00-59-32">00:59:32</a>]  you're saying that for rich people they have a lot of shame and I wonder if shame is the

[<a id="00-59-38">00:59:38</a>]  thing that holds families together which leads to success do you know what I mean so these

[<a id="00-59-45">00:59:45</a>]  people what do you mean like so you know it's like how do you like how do you keep a family

[<a id="00-59-52">00:59:52</a>]  together yeah over generations with the same focus that we've got to keep our shit from

[<a id="00-59-57">00:59:57</a>]  everyone else it's fear is a powerful motivator fucked up like there's going to be yeah and

[<a id="01-00-05">01:00:05</a>]  and so fear of being exposed fear of yeah so and and meanwhile like you're working in

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  porn you're like you got no shame because it's just like fucking yeah sexual dicks everywhere

[<a id="01-00-17">01:00:17</a>]  whatever yeah and and so I'm wondering if there's something in that idea it's like it's

[<a id="01-00-23">01:00:23</a>]  like it's the sexual fetishes the whole family's together in shame which leads to long-term

[<a id="01-00-30">01:00:30</a>]  wealth I'm not does that sound completely insane no I don't think you're insane I remember

[<a id="01-00-44">01:00:44</a>]  I was hanging out with my friend one time and he brought his sister and I asked her

[<a id="01-00-48">01:00:48</a>]  like what do you do what do you do you know Johan he's the one of the star of Linkin Park

[<a id="01-00-56">01:00:56</a>]  I haven't seen him in a while but you know I used to hang out a lot and he I think his

[<a id="01-01-00">01:01:00</a>]  sister worked for Wells Fargo and I might I might be wrong but I think she said she

[<a id="01-01-07">01:01:07</a>]  worked in the department and and so I thought she's like a banker right and then I find

[<a id="01-01-11">01:01:11</a>]  out I think she's I might be remembering this one but either she or her co-workers are anthropologists

[<a id="01-01-20">01:01:20</a>]  working for bank and historians and things like that so I was like well why do they need

[<a id="01-01-28">01:01:28</a>]  historian anthropologists for banks and she told me that what they do is they're part

[<a id="01-01-34">01:01:34</a>]  of wealth management so they'll pinpoint some of the richest people in California and they

[<a id="01-01-40">01:01:40</a>]  do research about this family so when they're pitching for like investment service for them

[<a id="01-01-47">01:01:47</a>]  they literally make movie where you know your Mr. Mrs. Johnson XYZ family in Northern California

[<a id="01-01-55">01:01:55</a>]  and they'll show history of their family like their great-great-great-grandfather

[<a id="01-01-59">01:01:59</a>]  lived in poverty Scotland 180 years ago difficult travel to New York and they work in suffer

[<a id="01-02-06">01:02:06</a>]  a lot in New York City and eventually raised enough money and met up with his cousin in

[<a id="01-02-11">01:02:11</a>]  Seattle and they start some kind of business and become during the gold rush they become

[<a id="01-02-16">01:02:16</a>]  rich and moved to California and ever since then they have a legacy wealth right so I

[<a id="01-02-23">01:02:23</a>]  think what they're saying is we know that we want to help you we want to help the Johnson

[<a id="01-02-28">01:02:28</a>]  family's legacy and we done so they're looking like they're flattered I think because holy

[<a id="01-02-33">01:02:33</a>]  shit they made a movie about our family they know our history what we want to do for my

[<a id="01-02-38">01:02:38</a>]  family and what they wanted for my kids my grant so this is kind of like a service that

[<a id="01-02-44">01:02:44</a>]  we're very serious we would love to help your business we would love for you to give us

[<a id="01-02-49">01:02:49</a>]  opportunity to work for you and we were going to bring world financial service in addition

[<a id="01-02-56">01:02:56</a>]  to knowing your family needs and we want to help you with your legacy and I'm thinking

[<a id="01-03-01">01:03:01</a>]  like they're not going to make a five-minute clip of my family you know like it was like

[<a id="01-03-04">01:03:04</a>]  a 10-second tick-tock but you know so yours would be a thriller so and when I start hanging

[<a id="01-03-13">01:03:13</a>]  out with us up Peters and in front David show and like when I was meeting met this some of

[<a id="01-03-19">01:03:19</a>]  these people hanging out and they hang out other rich people I would just sound like

[<a id="01-03-25">01:03:25</a>]  I didn't realize how much of dog shit my family was because how ghetto we are because they

[<a id="01-03-30">01:03:30</a>]  were offering service I've never heard before like even when first couple time I went to

[<a id="01-03-34">01:03:34</a>]  Vegas Dave he took me to special room within a casino that I didn't notice before and because

[<a id="01-03-41">01:03:41</a>]  I was hanging out with them because I was hanging out with them also this hot ladies

[<a id="01-03-48">01:03:48</a>]  in like a really nice outfit would you like some champagne like you know I've never had

[<a id="01-03-53">01:03:53</a>]  anybody treat me like that you know and like because Dave spent a lot of money lose a lot

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  of money win a lot of money you know and and I think second trip Dave had so many at the

[<a id="01-04-04">01:04:04</a>]  penthouse same time sometimes he forget we go like a Bellagio can we get a penthouse

[<a id="01-04-11">01:04:11</a>]  like Dave you already have it like you forgot that it's been there for seven days we went

[<a id="01-04-15">01:04:15</a>]  in and there's power money on his bed that he forgot then we would go like MGM Skyloft

[<a id="01-04-22">01:04:22</a>]  and when you go I didn't like all these things I never noticed before but there's a separate

[<a id="01-04-26">01:04:26</a>]  entrance for like peasants and rich people right so like Dave took us this thing and

[<a id="01-04-31">01:04:31</a>]  we go to high level Skyloft you know as soon as we went in all this beautiful women working

[<a id="01-04-37">01:04:37</a>]  at the counter they have to stand up every time we walk by because I'm friend of Dave

[<a id="01-04-42">01:04:42</a>]  you know so or when somebody one of my friends Alan was sick they get this world-class medical

[<a id="01-04-49">01:04:49</a>]  service that like they're so rich the doctors and all the medical staff come to your house

[<a id="01-04-54">01:04:54</a>]  but how what how did David Cho have all this money because so what happened was he was

[<a id="01-05-05">01:05:05</a>]  a struggling artist 20 plus years ago in K-town he went to this ice cream place it's owned

[<a id="01-05-11">01:05:11</a>]  by Korean lady and there's all this artwork and he said like this is shit I could do better

[<a id="01-05-16">01:05:16</a>]  so oh yeah well fruit so she said okay you could put you could put your stuff and within

[<a id="01-05-20">01:05:20</a>]  a couple months he starts selling his painting like 500 you know he's telling the guy and

[<a id="01-05-25">01:05:25</a>]  then one of the guys sold paintwork if I remember right and said hey I have a beauty salon in

[<a id="01-05-31">01:05:31</a>]  San Jose would you come I will I will commission you so he went up it's a huge fucking wall

[<a id="01-05-37">01:05:37</a>]  you know so it's it's like massive wall and that's where he met his future girlfriend

[<a id="01-05-44">01:05:44</a>]  Milan I think that's her name I met her just once and at the time she was cutting hair

[<a id="01-05-48">01:05:48</a>]  of not Mark Zuckerberg why am I forgetting one of the guy the founder of Facebook his

[<a id="01-06-00">01:06:00</a>]  girlfriend at the time was getting her hair cut and I think if I remember I oh wow I love

[<a id="01-06-05">01:06:05</a>]  your work I think she showed the work to her boyfriend which was played by Justin Timberlake

[<a id="01-06-12">01:06:12</a>]  in a movie why am I forgetting his name so anyway he's one of the founders anyway they

[<a id="01-06-18">01:06:18</a>]  met Dave he's an interesting guy he's a very talented guy he's edgy guy he just got a present

[<a id="01-06-23">01:06:23</a>]  in Japan you know and like he has no fear they like his shit they want to have this

[<a id="01-06-30">01:06:30</a>]  provocative art there's a new startup so he did a artwork and the deal was either 60,000

[<a id="01-06-38">01:06:38</a>]  or stock in Facebook and he does Facebook was a stupid idea because back then it was

[<a id="01-06-42">01:06:42</a>]  more myspace so I asked him like why did you still take the stock because he always said

[<a id="01-06-47">01:06:47</a>]  he always put money on genius people it takes a genius to recognize another genius so Sean

[<a id="01-06-54">01:06:54</a>]  Parker that's it Sean Parker's girlfriend was getting hair cut by Dave Zick's girlfriend

[<a id="01-06-59">01:06:59</a>]  anyway that's how they met he know Peter Thiel he did artwork and when the news came out

[<a id="01-07-04">01:07:04</a>]  in 2012 his share was like 200 250 million dollars he was cover on New York Times but

[<a id="01-07-13">01:07:13</a>]  that was beginning of the end for me because within a less than a week he was in the Harvard

[<a id="01-07-18">01:07:18</a>]  Stern show and the Harvard Stern show hey by the way my friend Yoshua Baishi will print

[<a id="01-07-23">01:07:23</a>]  you I don't know what the way he said it basically I'm pirating the product from my company and

[<a id="01-07-31">01:07:31</a>]  within like five or six days of that announcement I was fired from Evil Angel oh shit all right

[<a id="01-07-37">01:07:37</a>]  were you firing of course not but the guy who was the general manager didn't like me

[<a id="01-07-43">01:07:43</a>]  he was looking for reason so he lied to me and said hey it's beyond my control John's

[<a id="01-07-49">01:07:49</a>]  upset with you I need to let you go and also at the time I was working on David Thiel's

[<a id="01-07-56">01:07:56</a>]  Dave's Old Porn and I asked I contacted one of the director's wife because she is half

[<a id="01-08-02">01:08:02</a>]  Pakistani half Saudi Arabian porn star that made me laugh like that's a great combo we

[<a id="01-08-09">01:08:09</a>]  would like her on the Dave's Old Porn but they twist the words and said because I contact

[<a id="01-08-15">01:08:15</a>]  her and say hey you know I'm friend of your husband I work for Evil Angel he also told

[<a id="01-08-24">01:08:24</a>]  me that you like Russell Peters I could get your ticket to see him she said that's great

[<a id="01-08-28">01:08:28</a>]  and what they did was they twist the word by saying told John Steliana that I'll get

[<a id="01-08-36">01:08:36</a>]  your free tickets if you fuck Russell Peters that's not what I said that's not what I said

[<a id="01-08-41">01:08:41</a>]  so in a podcast John Ronson the last day of August they interview her she said oh no he

[<a id="01-08-47">01:08:47</a>]  contacted me about free ticket to see the show see I didn't lie you could call me all

[<a id="01-08-51">01:08:51</a>]  kinds of bullshit okay this is a little sidebar here about David Cho so the more I've learned

[<a id="01-08-57">01:08:57</a>]  about this guy I first encountered him on the on the Joe Rogan podcast yeah multiple

[<a id="01-09-03">01:09:03</a>]  times yeah he's this mad dude who's been finding dinosaurs in great shows advice yeah that's

[<a id="01-09-09">01:09:09</a>]  how that's how many read about him so and and you have thumbs up the hijacking show

[<a id="01-09-16">01:09:16</a>]  that he did for Vice yeah and the thing is the more I hear about like first of all his

[<a id="01-09-24">01:09:24</a>]  mentally ill yeah but like it's not an excuse but he's mentally ill yeah but my my question

[<a id="01-09-31">01:09:31</a>]  is why did you not fuck this guy up because there's multiple things like watching the

[<a id="01-09-36">01:09:36</a>]  episode with the two of you on Rogan and he he's not letting you talk then I listened

[<a id="01-09-41">01:09:41</a>]  to some of the Yoshi didn't podcast that you had yeah and listening to his story this guy

[<a id="01-09-47">01:09:47</a>]  fucking was stealing all your interesting stories and turning them into hits he would

[<a id="01-09-51">01:09:51</a>]  just embellish and why well that that and that was his hustle that the time he got cancelled

[<a id="01-09-57">01:09:57</a>]  for that thing that he told he was talking about rape that was my story because he said

[<a id="01-10-04">01:10:04</a>]  so backfired on him he fucked himself well okay so he was making story up you know I

[<a id="01-10-10">01:10:10</a>]  remember there was episode of Cheers when Frazier was telling story trying to read like

[<a id="01-10-14">01:10:14</a>]  a classic book Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens interesting enough when you start

[<a id="01-10-20">01:10:20</a>]  reading it from the bar full of idiots didn't like it so he started changing story like

[<a id="01-10-27">01:10:27</a>]  all of a sudden two lesbian pirates are making out you know it's not it he just changed the

[<a id="01-10-31">01:10:31</a>]  whole story then everybody in the bar starts stop listen start talking to each other like

[<a id="01-10-36">01:10:36</a>]  oh my god I didn't know Charles Dickens was this cool like you know and so he was doing

[<a id="01-10-40">01:10:40</a>]  that he was just making provocative story and and then because one time Dave said since

[<a id="01-10-46">01:10:46</a>]  you're you're from Japan you're a rapist because you know Japan World War II did terrible things

[<a id="01-10-50">01:10:50</a>]  I said that's right Dave that's what we do everyone from Japan when they get up in the

[<a id="01-10-54">01:10:54</a>]  morning they can't they just start stretching and say I can't wait to rape somebody today

[<a id="01-11-00">01:11:00</a>]  so I said stuff like yeah that's what that's what I do we we raped 24/7 and yeah when I'm

[<a id="01-11-07">01:11:07</a>]  getting massage I just put my dick in masseuse's mouth that's what I do Dave you're right we're

[<a id="01-11-11">01:11:11</a>]  all rapists dial 1-800-RAPE yeah rape rape rape rape rape so so on the pond after he fired

[<a id="01-11-19">01:11:19</a>]  me he made up the story where he was getting masseuse and he just stuck his dick I mean

[<a id="01-11-23">01:11:23</a>]  I don't think he remember it just it was lodged in his brain he blurted it out yeah I just

[<a id="01-11-27">01:11:27</a>]  like but the thing is okay so he got cancelled for that but he got you fired from the porn

[<a id="01-11-33">01:11:33</a>]  industry because of him fucking blurted well I mean I have 50% to yeah the guy was looking

[<a id="01-11-40">01:11:40</a>]  to get you out but he gave him the reason yeah so he he he what happens then did you

[<a id="01-11-46">01:11:46</a>]  know it was like when did this friendship with David show and here's the thing I didn't

[<a id="01-11-52">01:11:52</a>]  like it and when I heard that interview like oh no fuck right but I cannot get mad at anyone

[<a id="01-12-00">01:12:00</a>]  if they had a good intention because what he was trying to do is spread my name like

[<a id="01-12-04">01:12:04</a>]  let public know my name okay so it didn't quite work out because I do want a factoring

[<a id="01-12-12">01:12:12</a>]  intention because though he wasn't trying to get me fired he had a 50% reason why I

[<a id="01-12-17">01:12:17</a>]  got him fired but that wasn't in detention I can't get mad at that right okay like there's

[<a id="01-12-22">01:12:22</a>]  times when you're dealing with kids they did something didn't mean it okay they meant well

[<a id="01-12-29">01:12:29</a>]  but just didn't work out I can't get mad at that what I got mad year later when he says

[<a id="01-12-35">01:12:35</a>]  stop like on the pot like what did he say Yoshi for so I would have been Yoshi you're

[<a id="01-12-43">01:12:43</a>]  44 years old you don't have a job he just laughed at me on the pot and I'm thinking

[<a id="01-12-46">01:12:46</a>]  like I can't believe it was more than anger like how do you reconcile in your head like

[<a id="01-12-55">01:12:55</a>]  you had something to do with me getting fired and then and then making fun of me it's kind

[<a id="01-13-01">01:13:01</a>]  of like I said something and get Joe Rogan fired from UFC the year later it's in a Joe

[<a id="01-13-06">01:13:06</a>]  you don't have that job anymore and laugh at him I would never do that right because

[<a id="01-13-11">01:13:11</a>]  I'm saying I can say I have shame but it doesn't register in his head but at the time I thought

[<a id="01-13-19">01:13:19</a>]  he was being malicious because he have so many problems I wish I would know I mean I

[<a id="01-13-26">01:13:26</a>]  still don't know but you know after 13 years now getting fired reading stuff about bipolar

[<a id="01-13-34">01:13:34</a>]  and borderline personality anti-social personality problems you know because I made his mom that

[<a id="01-13-40">01:13:40</a>]  I was insane to argue with somebody what the meth your own is it's like that joke that

[<a id="01-13-45">01:13:45</a>]  Mitch Hepburn had you could be the greatest tennis player but you could never beat a wall

[<a id="01-13-49">01:13:49</a>]  you'll never beat a wall and if you're dealing with somebody mentally ill no amount of facts

[<a id="01-13-55">01:13:55</a>]  and reason and logic you could be Christopher Hitchens reasoning with logic you're never

[<a id="01-14-00">01:14:00</a>]  gonna win because they're mentally ill they don't think like that so I didn't know that

[<a id="01-14-04">01:14:04</a>]  I still don't understand to a point so I didn't like what happened to me but he's not a rapist

[<a id="01-14-14">01:14:14</a>]  he's not a violent guy he doesn't do drunk he doesn't do alcohol he has all kinds of

[<a id="01-14-18">01:14:18</a>]  problems so I don't know how do you reconcile when when you get older like like I met enough

[<a id="01-14-27">01:14:27</a>]  comedian with like borderline person you know well mental health is a big thing in the comedy

[<a id="01-14-34">01:14:34</a>]  scene I would say yes but the borderline thing that it's like this really there's no cure

[<a id="01-14-39">01:14:39</a>]  for that once you have it you know you have to manage that so so imagine your heart and

[<a id="01-14-47">01:14:47</a>]  brain is on fire all the time you know I mean I at one point I am mad at him because I didn't

[<a id="01-14-58">01:14:58</a>]  like treat it that way but I always try to put myself in their shoes like I can't even

[<a id="01-15-03">01:15:03</a>]  imagine you know like having that issue I mean believe me there was this one Jackie Chan

[<a id="01-15-10">01:15:10</a>]  movie where he was running a store and he was catching a bunch of guys shoplifting so

[<a id="01-15-14">01:15:14</a>]  he was collecting the cashier how much they're stealing and I could only imagine if a therapist

[<a id="01-15-20">01:15:20</a>]  met me and just let listen to me talk for like 10 minutes like they're just like oh

[<a id="01-15-24">01:15:24</a>]  my god here it is all this mental problems you know oh my god it's like hey cancel the

[<a id="01-15-31">01:15:31</a>]  appointment this son of a you know so I only imagine that you know yeah that's why you

[<a id="01-15-38">01:15:38</a>]  don't go to therapy that that's why people ask me like how could you hang out with Richard

[<a id="01-15-44">01:15:44</a>]  the sex offender it's saying it's the same reason because I don't want to see kids get

[<a id="01-15-48">01:15:48</a>]  hurt yeah the only way you could try to prevent this or minimize it is actually talking to

[<a id="01-15-55">01:15:55</a>]  people doing that shit yes you want to put a gas and burn and kill them but what does

[<a id="01-16-01">01:16:01</a>]  that do like I want to prevent future problems right yeah so that's why I talk to these people

[<a id="01-16-09">01:16:09</a>]  talking to your friend is easy of course talking to people that you find of foreign and terrible

[<a id="01-16-15">01:16:15</a>]  is necessary you know but my friend Joey Kurtzman who was part of that KGB podcast Korean Koreans

[<a id="01-16-21">01:16:21</a>]  Gone Bad he was the only Jew and he hang out he grew up with so many Asians like he think

[<a id="01-16-27">01:16:27</a>]  like an Asian person and Joey Kurtzman told me what and Joey is so smart there was a debate

[<a id="01-16-32">01:16:32</a>]  between him and this very famous rabbi Joseph Jewish person but they were having debate

[<a id="01-16-39">01:16:39</a>]  and that debate was so interesting and going back powerful going both ways back and forth

[<a id="01-16-46">01:16:46</a>]  that the guy who one of the richest men in Israel who used to own Venetian contact Joey's

[<a id="01-16-52">01:16:52</a>]  boss and say how impressed he was Joey's that smart Joe's also one of the you know early

[<a id="01-16-58">01:16:58</a>]  Wikipedia editor like you have to surpass he you have to pass certain group of members

[<a id="01-17-04">01:17:04</a>]  to see your expert for and he didn't pass the first time because there was a group of

[<a id="01-17-10">01:17:10</a>]  Palestinians in no not another fucking Jew but there are a couple other Arabs like no

[<a id="01-17-15">01:17:15</a>]  Joe is not like that because he went to northern Africa Israel hang out with the Muslims when

[<a id="01-17-21">01:17:21</a>]  the Muslims are saying things we need to kill the Jews the blood of Israel and I Joe in

[<a id="01-17-26">01:17:26</a>]  front of all the Muslims and I'm a Jew he's that crazy right and like they were kind of

[<a id="01-17-32">01:17:32</a>]  like shocked like a Jew was speaking like hundreds of Muslims and they all say the same

[<a id="01-17-36">01:17:36</a>]  thing well we don't need Jews like you anyway they go back anyway the blood of the Jew you

[<a id="01-17-41">01:17:41</a>]  know they so Joey's that crazy but he's friend with David Cho and me he understood me and

[<a id="01-17-47">01:17:47</a>]  Dave very well you know right and and and he was I really miss him he's the one who

[<a id="01-17-54">01:17:54</a>]  set up the comedy for all the registered sex offender in San Luis Obispo Joe is also the

[<a id="01-17-59">01:17:59</a>]  guy who used to work at Tescadero clinically insane hospital where they keep the worst

[<a id="01-18-06">01:18:06</a>]  serial killer times you know what you said to me one time Yoshi please don't take offense

[<a id="01-18-11">01:18:11</a>]  but it's way easier for me to deal with the insane people than when I have to deal with

[<a id="01-18-16">01:18:16</a>]  you and Dave he deal with murderers and rapists and serial killers you know so I

[<a id="01-18-24">01:18:24</a>]  understand I'm crazy but sometimes in a crazy world only rational thing that you should

[<a id="01-18-31">01:18:31</a>]  do is be crazy you know because it kind of neutralized the craziness so when I go all

[<a id="01-18-36">01:18:36</a>]  this really weird places people kind of scratch their head but I think it's necessary not

[<a id="01-18-41">01:18:41</a>]  unique crazy people to like your portfolio of investment you should have small amount

[<a id="01-18-47">01:18:47</a>]  of cryptocurrency that have a small whackos like me and Dave you need some crazy people

[<a id="01-18-55">01:18:55</a>]  because sometimes they do the right thing for all the wrong reasons you know that's

[<a id="01-18-59">01:18:59</a>]  why I kind of think Trump in a really weird way I get it just like Kanye West like there's

[<a id="01-19-07">01:19:07</a>]  a place for crazy people yeah I think this is how you question do you still keep in touch

[<a id="01-19-14">01:19:14</a>]  with Dave no last time I saw him I got kicked out of medical study so I didn't have anything

[<a id="01-19-21">01:19:21</a>]  to do and my friend was doing show in La Jolla comedy so so I drove down there I got a spot

[<a id="01-19-26">01:19:26</a>]  and it went really well after the show I'm in a bar all of a sudden I see Dave walking

[<a id="01-19-31">01:19:31</a>]  out of a comedy show in San Diego some reason he just happened to be there I saw I was shocked

[<a id="01-19-36">01:19:36</a>]  because my eyesight so bad I didn't know he was an audience he clearly saw me he doesn't

[<a id="01-19-41">01:19:41</a>]  make my eye contact he just walk out of the fucking place I know he saw me and there's

[<a id="01-19-46">01:19:46</a>]  a couple he's ashamed now no I don't know about that I don't think no no no that's one

[<a id="01-19-51">01:19:51</a>]  thing he doesn't that's 100% that's one thing he doesn't feel is shame no way okay narcissism

[<a id="01-19-57">01:19:57</a>]  bipolar borderline personality anti-social I know he has anti-social personality disorder

[<a id="01-20-03">01:20:03</a>]  for sure but but I'm very grateful because hanging out with him kind of prepared me to

[<a id="01-20-11">01:20:11</a>]  deal with like other crazy people like I'm very grateful like I mean like I went Afghanistan

[<a id="01-20-17">01:20:17</a>]  went to the biggest prison Charlie Parker prison and I'm kind of like communicant Taliban

[<a id="01-20-22">01:20:22</a>]  how many people have chance to do that or you know meet some family members or murder

[<a id="01-20-27">01:20:27</a>]  by serial killer or I went to Bernie Madoff's home or you know like even with a little bit

[<a id="01-20-34">01:20:34</a>]  of modest money I mean I don't know exactly what I'm looking for to answer your question

[<a id="01-20-38">01:20:38</a>]  I don't know until I go there you know it's like pornography I'll know him when I see

[<a id="01-20-42">01:20:42</a>]  it launch a website called Talley fan but I just I just gonna go like maybe nothing will

[<a id="01-20-48">01:20:48</a>]  come out of it you know but look when I went to Munich on the fifth year anniversary of

[<a id="01-20-55">01:20:55</a>]  the Munich Olympic assassination I went to the Olympic Park Park and just pure coincidence

[<a id="01-21-04">01:21:04</a>]  there was a guy who is a historian a sports fan and I you know so I didn't know he was

[<a id="01-21-09">01:21:09</a>]  going to be there you never know until you go this you know they were serendipity right

[<a id="01-21-16">01:21:16</a>]  the word origin is that there are three Persian Prince named Serendip and when they travel

[<a id="01-21-21">01:21:21</a>]  and go on adventure all this miraculous weird things that happen hence the word serendipity

[<a id="01-21-26">01:21:26</a>]  so that's what I'm looking for sometimes you never know until you go like this two cup

[<a id="01-21-31">01:21:31</a>]  two friends I made and you're praying I would have never made them unless I show up you

[<a id="01-21-35">01:21:35</a>]  know like Woody Allen said 90 percent of success or 80 percent success in life is just showing

[<a id="01-21-42">01:21:42</a>]  up so I'm just showing up I bomb everywhere I go and during comedy you know at least you're

[<a id="01-21-48">01:21:48</a>]  showing up I'm showing up it's better to bomb than not showing up and not doing anything

[<a id="01-21-54">01:21:54</a>]  and that's I think that's a beautiful closure here is this the last one this is the last

[<a id="01-22-00">01:22:00</a>]  one you've so this has been this has been the first season of this particular podcast

[<a id="01-22-09">01:22:09</a>]  whatever comes out of it well can I do it because it's last thanks for the hospitality

[<a id="01-22-19">01:22:19</a>]  both of you because you didn't have to do it because when you invite somebody you don't

[<a id="01-22-23">01:22:23</a>]  know they're going to be problem and I really appreciate both of you going out of your way

[<a id="01-22-29">01:22:29</a>]  whether showing up at the train station to pick me up or you know feeding me when you

[<a id="01-22-35">01:22:35</a>]  guys went out of your way because the 100 percent guarantee you will make no money out

[<a id="01-22-40">01:22:40</a>]  of this I'm telling you you're going to make no money whatsoever 100 percent guarantee

[<a id="01-22-48">01:22:48</a>]  but I'm glad you're able to do it and it was great because for you it was interesting for

[<a id="01-22-54">01:22:54</a>]  me because when I went to your house I don't know who was the parent because when I talked

[<a id="01-22-59">01:22:59</a>]  to your daughter she seems very mature but clearly you did an amazing job because when

[<a id="01-23-05">01:23:05</a>]  sometimes they're mad at you it's because they really really care for you they're they're

[<a id="01-23-09">01:23:09</a>]  amazing kids and I have never met any of my friends show interest want to talk to me because

[<a id="01-23-14">01:23:14</a>]  a lot of people weirded out about me you know like who's this retard really I'm honestly

[<a id="01-23-19">01:23:19</a>]  but both of your kids very kind show me respect and genuinely interesting what I have to say

[<a id="01-23-26">01:23:26</a>]  so that's what was really weird because when my friends introduced me to their kids it's

[<a id="01-23-31">01:23:31</a>]  like bringing a monkey or like you know like a like a you know in high school yeah more

[<a id="01-23-42">01:23:42</a>]  like a skunk in high school I remember there was a biology teacher they had a project where

[<a id="01-23-47">01:23:47</a>]  you collect bugs insect and you get certain points how exotic they are well this is unfair

[<a id="01-23-52">01:23:52</a>]  because if you're rich kid or your father's rich he'll go all kinds of foreign country

[<a id="01-23-57">01:23:57</a>]  bringing exotic bugs like you know one guy brought this beautiful Malaysian like a I

[<a id="01-24-02">01:24:02</a>]  don't know rainbow I'm just making it up rainbow butterfly or these beetles and stuff like

[<a id="01-24-06">01:24:06</a>]  that I I mean ghettos I have to bring cockroach flea you know just a ghetto bugs you know

[<a id="01-24-13">01:24:13</a>]  like you just discuss you know poor bugs right rich kids have this exotic beautiful rich

[<a id="01-24-19">01:24:19</a>]  insects you know what I mean you bring the kookaraches yeah so like so maggots you know

[<a id="01-24-26">01:24:26</a>]  tick please moth you know mosquito mosquito yeah it just get all insect you know but when

[<a id="01-24-36">01:24:36</a>]  I met met your kids they're beautiful kids they're gonna met them for us into even a beautiful

[<a id="01-24-43">01:24:43</a>]  butterfly and on because I think you did a great job no matter dysfunction you have and

[<a id="01-24-51">01:24:51</a>]  problems you have one thing you had to be proud of you did a damn good job raising your

[<a id="01-24-57">01:24:57</a>]  kids you know you know and and they are your masterpieces right no I said it's the one

[<a id="01-25-05">01:25:05</a>]  thing I didn't fuck up let's put it that way yeah they're a great kid and it was really

[<a id="01-25-10">01:25:10</a>]  nice of you guys to pick me up because I will I was willing to stay at the airport to like

[<a id="01-25-15">01:25:15</a>]  seven hours before the train was available they rent a fucking car and pick me up it's

[<a id="01-25-19">01:25:19</a>]  like in the middle of winter you would have had like a frozen no no I mean airport was

[<a id="01-25-23">01:25:23</a>]  open so I would have been fine okay but but still like six seven hours wait we don't talk

[<a id="01-25-28">01:25:28</a>]  in Geneva no no he showed up at 4 a.m. or something so all right I took a blob off from

[<a id="01-25-35">01:25:35</a>]  Geneva all the way to sir that's what it was yeah a lot of times comedy happened because

[<a id="01-25-40">01:25:40</a>]  I used the cheapest form of transportation and sometimes I'm stuck in the middle of someplace

[<a id="01-25-45">01:25:45</a>]  I didn't anticipate like when I went to fucking dunce they say it was a bus station I thought

[<a id="01-25-52">01:25:52</a>]  it's like bus station like what you have here like it's warm inside there's no office so

[<a id="01-25-57">01:25:57</a>]  I didn't have no place to go like fuck me I'm gonna be I'm gonna freeze to death I walked

[<a id="01-26-03">01:26:03</a>]  around eventually if I'm KFC which became my embassy for that day now every time visit

[<a id="01-26-08">01:26:08</a>]  someplace I come back and warm up for a couple hours eat and I leave and check other places

[<a id="01-26-12">01:26:12</a>]  you know so a lot of time when I did this cheap travel something unpleasant happened

[<a id="01-26-19">01:26:19</a>]  which turned out to be a comedy later on but I mean I've also got to say I've thoroughly

[<a id="01-26-24">01:26:24</a>]  enjoyed spending time with you I mean you're you're definitely guys got a fucking room

[<a id="01-26-29">01:26:29</a>]  yeah okay just chill out mister it's Swiss guy having a feeling here he's like I can't

[<a id="01-26-34">01:26:34</a>]  handle it no because my dad my dad say like even stupid people have something they know

[<a id="01-26-41">01:26:41</a>]  something I don't know what and you know a lot of shit that I don't know like programming

[<a id="01-26-45">01:26:45</a>]  this and that it's very focused I mean I mean most of all and I'll cut out a long story

[<a id="01-26-51">01:26:51</a>]  but most of all it's just nice to meet someone who made it past 50 who's not a boring motherfucker

[<a id="01-26-56">01:26:56</a>]  there are so many of them I don't want to spend time with them but maybe the thing we're

[<a id="01-27-03">01:27:03</a>]  gonna follow this on we're doing this visit to the World Economic Forum that's a good

[<a id="01-27-08">01:27:08</a>]  point for Christian to explain what the fuck we're doing that okay oh but before and also

[<a id="01-27-13">01:27:13</a>]  question thank you because you know without you I would never meet Harry and we started

[<a id="01-27-19">01:27:19</a>]  having a discussion and it was really nice to do a podcast where I don't have to explain

[<a id="01-27-23">01:27:23</a>]  stuff what's that you don't like because they don't know something that happened 20 years

[<a id="01-27-27">01:27:27</a>]  ago or something so it was fun I don't have to explain we're on the same page even though

[<a id="01-27-33">01:27:33</a>]  you're quite younger than us you're a lot mature in that regard and World Economic Forum

[<a id="01-27-39">01:27:39</a>]  how banking work you know like I really enjoy because I don't know any of that stuff you

[<a id="01-27-43">01:27:43</a>]  know and one one of the few good things I did was you'll meet Rosie Tran eventually

[<a id="01-27-51">01:27:51</a>]  but she's the only one who will actually listen to stuff I said in econ yeah I'm trying to

[<a id="01-27-55">01:27:55</a>]  get you to give me this fucking financial advice you won't do it but no no I don't know any

[<a id="01-28-00">01:28:00</a>]  of it but but she really believed what I said and she actually stick with that plan and

[<a id="01-28-08">01:28:08</a>]  she's multi-millionaire because of that and she won't show even tell you like it was me

[<a id="01-28-12">01:28:12</a>]  and my friend Paul currency who's been helping with one man show like she took it to heart

[<a id="01-28-17">01:28:17</a>]  and when I say stuff alike I don't think minimum wage is good for poor people she said that's

[<a id="01-28-22">01:28:22</a>]  crazy but she actually read my position and actually change your mind a lot of people

[<a id="01-28-29">01:28:29</a>]  don't do that they just call me like I'm a fascist and Nazi and maybe cold-hearted person

[<a id="01-28-33">01:28:33</a>]  whatever maybe we can introduce my kids to her at some point she can teach them some

[<a id="01-28-37">01:28:37</a>]  shit I don't know because I failed on that front but anyway but they think you brought

[<a id="01-28-43">01:28:43</a>]  sophistication and class and you never got mad at us and even though he make fun of you

[<a id="01-28-51">01:28:51</a>]  aspirational stuff I think that's a good thing but you called me aspirational yeah and there's

[<a id="01-29-08">01:29:08</a>]  professional life because I had so little of I only had like two years of bookkeeping

[<a id="01-29-12">01:29:12</a>]  in like a real financial building in data cash comma it was a legitimate financial building

[<a id="01-29-17">01:29:17</a>]  and there's a real people actually a real job in fact that's the same building way they

[<a id="01-29-21">01:29:21</a>]  have Russell index which is a real thing in the financial market that's the building I

[<a id="01-29-26">01:29:26</a>]  was working I was doing bookkeeping for this like a fat Japanese guy it's where they the

[<a id="01-29-31">01:29:31</a>]  Russell index is the index of all the small medium companies I'm just saying I was I was

[<a id="01-29-36">01:29:36</a>]  working a weird thing about Russell's that's all I'm hearing so but through you it's nice

[<a id="01-29-46">01:29:46</a>]  to hear how those things work you know and and I have to say as much as some rich people

[<a id="01-29-51">01:29:51</a>]  cause a lot of problems there are plenty of rich people extremely generous with their

[<a id="01-29-56">01:29:56</a>]  time they're more than willing to help people giving advice to poor people and that's what

[<a id="01-30-01">01:30:01</a>]  makes me sad how poor people grow up you know there's a story about Oppenheimer when he

[<a id="01-30-07">01:30:07</a>]  was a kid the parents raised him as an adult early on so he was able to learn to talk to

[<a id="01-30-12">01:30:12</a>]  adults from young age he was also a member of a geological society where he was geological

[<a id="01-30-18">01:30:18</a>]  society in New York so when he was member and give a speech when he went up to front

[<a id="01-30-22">01:30:22</a>]  of the adult they start laughing because what what what's this kid talking to like average

[<a id="01-30-27">01:30:27</a>]  age is like 58 or something right but and thanks thanks to his parents we have things

[<a id="01-30-35">01:30:35</a>]  to destroy the planet many times and because he was able to learn to speak to adults those

[<a id="01-30-45">01:30:45</a>]  geological members were stunned and at the end of it they clap because this kid amazing

[<a id="01-30-52">01:30:52</a>]  job and poor rich kids from young age learn to talk the authority respectfully like they

[<a id="01-30-59">01:30:59</a>]  will talk they know how to talk to doctor like I'm not feeling good and poor kids never

[<a id="01-31-02">01:31:02</a>]  learn to do that they're always afraid of authority and I think what I'm trying to do

[<a id="01-31-07">01:31:07</a>]  is by talking about a little bit of econ and sex that that you shouldn't hate them but

[<a id="01-31-14">01:31:14</a>]  they also have weakness there's a lot of shame but if you're going to improve your situation

[<a id="01-31-20">01:31:20</a>]  you kind of have to learn how rich people think and behave there's no way around that

[<a id="01-31-25">01:31:25</a>]  just simply hating them or because you want to shoot them because they don't give you

[<a id="01-31-29">01:31:29</a>]  proper health insurance that's not a really practical way to deal with it yeah so I'm

[<a id="01-31-34">01:31:34</a>]  trying to break a little bit of fear so even like going to opera but believe me I've seen

[<a id="01-31-42">01:31:42</a>]  more opera every family member I had in the last thousand years my ancestor combined because

[<a id="01-31-49">01:31:49</a>]  there is this invisible barrier that people are afraid mingling with these people yes

[<a id="01-31-54">01:31:54</a>]  and I was embarrassed because I don't know any of it it's a class thing yes and that's

[<a id="01-32-01">01:32:01</a>]  something you learn in England class system too so the way I speak my broken English I

[<a id="01-32-07">01:32:07</a>]  get ridiculed not going to proper school but I know if you could learn to tolerate that

[<a id="01-32-15">01:32:15</a>]  ridicule and shame you make a baby step you go to those places eventually you learn ten

[<a id="01-32-24">01:32:24</a>]  or two and that's not an opera you go you learn more you get a little bit comfortable

[<a id="01-32-28">01:32:28</a>]  you go into musicals and plays or this is what I call gay science even though Nietzsche

[<a id="01-32-36">01:32:36</a>]  have a book on gay science but what I mean is like for even if you don't have money there's

[<a id="01-32-42">01:32:42</a>]  things that you know could leverage and open the whole world to you if you know these things

[<a id="01-32-47">01:32:47</a>]  right so that's why when I talked to Rosie she did successful my financially it makes

[<a id="01-32-54">01:32:54</a>]  me very sad when she said like I don't give a shit about literature and stuff like that

[<a id="01-32-57">01:32:57</a>]  I don't I don't really like that to hear that because believe me when when you lose somebody

[<a id="01-33-04">01:33:04</a>]  important to you no amount of economic theory could help you with that or knowing cryptocurrency

[<a id="01-33-10">01:33:10</a>]  or programming there is a place for literature poetry and art you know so that invisible

[<a id="01-33-18">01:33:18</a>]  barrier that we the poor people have like oh you can't get out of it believe me I don't

[<a id="01-33-22">01:33:22</a>]  like this talk about attacking capitalism capitalism have raised living standard for

[<a id="01-33-27">01:33:27</a>]  so many people it's the rich kids growing up privileged attacking the very thing that

[<a id="01-33-32">01:33:32</a>]  they benefit from that kind of shit really infuriates me yeah so that's why I know I'm

[<a id="01-33-39">01:33:39</a>]  all over the place but those are the reason why I do the things I do and when you are

[<a id="01-33-46">01:33:46</a>]  dealing with rich people I one thing I noticed because I know porn and sex they end up talking

[<a id="01-33-51">01:33:51</a>]  to you because every time rich people they don't want to talk to me until my friend Dave

[<a id="01-33-56">01:33:56</a>]  told his billionaire boss Sam you should work for Buttman and he goes I love Buttman like

[<a id="01-34-02">01:34:02</a>]  like they didn't want to talk to me but all of a sudden I have a little bit of knowledge

[<a id="01-34-07">01:34:07</a>]  the world that they're ashamed to cross but they kind of want to know that's all of a

[<a id="01-34-11">01:34:11</a>]  sudden I got access to these people that's the entry point this sex and pornography and

[<a id="01-34-17">01:34:17</a>]  perversion is my entry point so however disgusting some of the porn story I told you that's that's

[<a id="01-34-24">01:34:24</a>]  the gateway to these people you know and so I don't want to hate them but I'd like to

[<a id="01-34-29">01:34:29</a>]  learn more of that so that's that's why I go work and kind of foreign porn is my wildcard

[<a id="01-34-35">01:34:35</a>]  so meeting you guys through comedy is my wild card the next the next thing you're gonna

[<a id="01-34-42">01:34:42</a>]  see on this podcast is probably gonna be some documentary or short form of Yoshi at the World

[<a id="01-34-54">01:34:54</a>]  Economic Forum if that happens the hard part is getting him to fucking not freak out when

[<a id="01-35-00">01:35:00</a>]  we point a camera at him it's where he'll do a podcast but then the moment you're just

[<a id="01-35-05">01:35:05</a>]  walking around you point a camera he just makes it I mean I don't know anything fun's

[<a id="01-35-09">01:35:09</a>]  gonna happen you know probably not that's when there is a camera a fun shit happens

[<a id="01-35-14">01:35:14</a>]  you attract it but so are you going next let's talk about logistics after so the one thing

[<a id="01-35-23">01:35:23</a>]  I wanted to say is next time we're gonna record an episode with you in person again is gonna

[<a id="01-35-28">01:35:28</a>]  be in a couple of months probably may I would like to come earlier but depends on my financial

[<a id="01-35-35">01:35:35</a>]  situation yeah yeah I would like to come and we will continue these sort of wild conversations

[<a id="01-35-41">01:35:41</a>]  that we've had it has been fun thank you very much for being here you next time maybe when

[<a id="01-35-45">01:35:45</a>]  I'm talking to you it may be after I just went to Diddy's case in Mayfair that's the

[<a id="01-35-52">01:35:52</a>]  big one that's the super bowl for me that's gonna be fascinating all right all right bye

[<a id="01-35-59">01:35:59</a>]  thanks guys that was a that was a good one it was it was and we got a lot of good ones

[<a id="01-36-07">01:36:07</a>]  it just got Eddie a lot of this stuff because it's you know there's times like we were just

[<a id="01-36-10">01:36:10</a>]  talking about comedy reference nobody cares about those comedy yeah yeah that's true I

[<a id="01-36-14">01:36:14</a>]  mean no that is very true I mean I think there's I don't know I've got to figure that but I

[<a id="01-36-23">01:36:23</a>]  I think there's a lot.
