[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  to invading chemicals.

[<a id="00-00-02">00:00:02</a>]  Something's wrong.

[<a id="00-00-10">00:00:10</a>]  - What's wrong?

[<a id="00-00-11">00:00:11</a>]  - Oh, no, no, just something's wrong with my body,

[<a id="00-00-13">00:00:13</a>]  I'm sure, because all those chemicals.

[<a id="00-00-15">00:00:15</a>]  11 1/2 years, how many medication?

[<a id="00-00-27">00:00:27</a>]  Snipe, spinal tap, all kinds of--

[<a id="00-00-30">00:00:30</a>]  - They did a fucking, geez.

[<a id="00-00-32">00:00:32</a>]  All right, let's go.

[<a id="00-00-33">00:00:33</a>]  That's it, spinal tap.

[<a id="00-00-36">00:00:36</a>]  So you got into spinal tap,

[<a id="00-00-45">00:00:45</a>]  you got into the medical testing.

[<a id="00-00-47">00:00:47</a>]  - Oh, you're already recording?

[<a id="00-00-49">00:00:49</a>]  - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, we're just rolling.

[<a id="00-00-50">00:00:50</a>]  - Oh, wait, wait, I need to hit this button as well.

[<a id="00-00-55">00:00:55</a>]  So you got into medical testing just for the money

[<a id="00-00-59">00:00:59</a>]  or out of curiosity?

[<a id="00-01-00">00:01:00</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-01">00:01:01</a>]  I guess you guys never say like, what time is it?

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  November 24th, what time is it?

[<a id="00-01-06">00:01:06</a>]  2.70 p.m.

[<a id="00-01-08">00:01:08</a>]  I don't know why that matters,

[<a id="00-01-09">00:01:09</a>]  but how many have we done, four or five of these things?

[<a id="00-01-14">00:01:14</a>]  - I mean, we've been talking, yeah, like random stuff,

[<a id="00-01-18">00:01:18</a>]  the first one, you and me,

[<a id="00-01-20">00:01:20</a>]  but that's probably gonna look like shit

[<a id="00-01-22">00:01:22</a>]  'cause the, whatever, yeah, we've got audio, we've got--

[<a id="00-01-27">00:01:27</a>]  - I'm just saying, I guess you gotta do

[<a id="00-01-28">00:01:28</a>]  exactly what these kids are doing,

[<a id="00-01-30">00:01:30</a>]  like we just cut whatever the things are useful

[<a id="00-01-32">00:01:32</a>]  and throw away, yeah.

[<a id="00-01-35">00:01:35</a>]  - Yeah, I mean-- - It's like sashimi,

[<a id="00-01-36">00:01:36</a>]  you just cut the right part

[<a id="00-01-38">00:01:38</a>]  and throw the rest of them away, I guess.

[<a id="00-01-40">00:01:40</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, if you wanna blow up,

[<a id="00-01-43">00:01:43</a>]  in the end, that whole thing is horrible

[<a id="00-01-45">00:01:45</a>]  because, like, 'cause I'm autistic or a nerd,

[<a id="00-01-50">00:01:50</a>]  I know how to, like, I micro-optimize,

[<a id="00-01-54">00:01:54</a>]  the same way I was writing code,

[<a id="00-01-56">00:01:56</a>]  I figured out, I'm gradually figuring out

[<a id="00-01-58">00:01:58</a>]  how to do the videos, and there's so much about this stuff

[<a id="00-02-01">00:02:01</a>]  to hijack people's attention,

[<a id="00-02-04">00:02:04</a>]  just details of, like, every three seconds,

[<a id="00-02-06">00:02:06</a>]  you gotta cut in and out.

[<a id="00-02-08">00:02:08</a>]  You gotta have something that makes people think

[<a id="00-02-12">00:02:12</a>]  their phone just broke when they scroll over your video

[<a id="00-02-15">00:02:15</a>]  'cause it gets them out of their boredness

[<a id="00-02-18">00:02:18</a>]  and go, oh, I need to, what's this?

[<a id="00-02-20">00:02:20</a>]  And it's, and then there's things like Inception,

[<a id="00-02-23">00:02:23</a>]  you know the movie Inception with the story--

[<a id="00-02-25">00:02:25</a>]  - Christopher Nolan, right, yeah.

[<a id="00-02-26">00:02:26</a>]  - Yeah, the story within a story,

[<a id="00-02-28">00:02:28</a>]  which is actually about hypnosis

[<a id="00-02-30">00:02:30</a>]  and how to manipulate people's brains,

[<a id="00-02-33">00:02:33</a>]  but that's what you're doing.

[<a id="00-02-34">00:02:34</a>]  A lot of the videos where they have a text at the top

[<a id="00-02-37">00:02:37</a>]  where the video's about one thing,

[<a id="00-02-39">00:02:39</a>]  but then the text will say,

[<a id="00-02-40">00:02:40</a>]  do you remember when your mom used to say this to you?

[<a id="00-02-43">00:02:43</a>]  So you take people back to something they relate to.

[<a id="00-02-46">00:02:46</a>]  - So eventually, after I leave,

[<a id="00-02-48">00:02:48</a>]  whenever you have free time,

[<a id="00-02-49">00:02:49</a>]  you're gonna watch the whole thing and just cut the best part.

[<a id="00-02-51">00:02:51</a>]  Is that what you're gonna do?

[<a id="00-02-52">00:02:52</a>]  - Apparently, yeah.

[<a id="00-02-53">00:02:53</a>]  - Yeah, no, no, I'm not complaining.

[<a id="00-02-55">00:02:55</a>]  I just don't know, what do you do with it, you know?

[<a id="00-02-57">00:02:57</a>]  - Well, I mean, I've gotta get back in touch

[<a id="00-03-00">00:03:00</a>]  with Nikki, this director.

[<a id="00-03-02">00:03:02</a>]  She might wanna make something out of it.

[<a id="00-03-05">00:03:05</a>]  Maybe we can just--

[<a id="00-03-09">00:03:09</a>]  - I think she'd probably have a better sense

[<a id="00-03-10">00:03:10</a>]  not to do anything at all 'cause I think,

[<a id="00-03-12">00:03:12</a>]  I mean, I don't know.

[<a id="00-03-14">00:03:14</a>]  Doesn't she have something better to do?

[<a id="00-03-16">00:03:16</a>]  Seriously.

[<a id="00-03-18">00:03:18</a>]  - Well, I mean, she's got some devil ambition

[<a id="00-03-20">00:03:20</a>]  and maybe you're her meal ticket to director stardom

[<a id="00-03-25">00:03:25</a>]  of like she--

[<a id="00-03-26">00:03:26</a>]  - I don't think so.

[<a id="00-03-27">00:03:27</a>]  - Yeah, maybe not.

[<a id="00-03-29">00:03:29</a>]  - You know.

[<a id="00-03-31">00:03:31</a>]  - I mean, to me, the interesting thing would be this,

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  like I was just saying,

[<a id="00-03-33">00:03:33</a>]  it's like if somebody who knows you from back in the day

[<a id="00-03-37">00:03:37</a>]  on whatever podcast you were doing,

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  and then, because what I got from watching your podcast

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  is there's many stories you told

[<a id="00-03-46">00:03:46</a>]  where because you've got some comedians

[<a id="00-03-48">00:03:48</a>]  who are idiots, they keep interrupting you

[<a id="00-03-50">00:03:50</a>]  every time it gets to an interesting part

[<a id="00-03-52">00:03:52</a>]  'cause you hit their comfort zone,

[<a id="00-03-54">00:03:54</a>]  then they gotta make stupid jokes,

[<a id="00-03-56">00:03:56</a>]  and by then, the thread of conversation is lost.

[<a id="00-04-01">00:04:01</a>]  And so, and I think there's people that just,

[<a id="00-04-04">00:04:04</a>]  they've heard you half tell many stories

[<a id="00-04-07">00:04:07</a>]  which gets them curious about you,

[<a id="00-04-08">00:04:08</a>]  and then maybe this, we can,

[<a id="00-04-10">00:04:10</a>]  we turn it into 100 hours of Yoshi,

[<a id="00-04-13">00:04:13</a>]  and, or we can just release it on Pornhub.

[<a id="00-04-16">00:04:16</a>]  - I mean, even if you record, let's say, 100 hours,

[<a id="00-04-21">00:04:21</a>]  honestly, probably useful parts,

[<a id="00-04-23">00:04:23</a>]  probably like 40 minutes or an hour and a half, you know.

[<a id="00-04-27">00:04:27</a>]  - I think it depends on what--

[<a id="00-04-29">00:04:29</a>]  - That's still a lot if you think about it.

[<a id="00-04-31">00:04:31</a>]  - I mean, it depends on,

[<a id="00-04-33">00:04:33</a>]  like there's a niche for everything, I think.

[<a id="00-04-35">00:04:35</a>]  Like you're watching this thing about

[<a id="00-04-37">00:04:37</a>]  whatever that war was in 1499, the--

[<a id="00-04-40">00:04:40</a>]  - Swabian War, am I saying that name right?

[<a id="00-04-42">00:04:42</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-04-43">00:04:43</a>]  - That's the north of Sweden, that's Switzerland, I guess.

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  You actually spoke the Swabian, you've nailed it.

[<a id="00-04-49">00:04:49</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-04-50">00:04:50</a>]  - The SCHW, but, but--

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  - Over the years, I remember seeing that and like,

[<a id="00-04-54">00:04:54</a>]  "What is this?"

[<a id="00-04-55">00:04:55</a>]  And they have all this really weird term

[<a id="00-04-56">00:04:56</a>]  for parts of area where I'm used to simply calling it

[<a id="00-05-01">00:05:01</a>]  France or Germany and things like that.

[<a id="00-05-03">00:05:03</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-03">00:05:03</a>]  - But these conflicts, you know,

[<a id="00-05-05">00:05:05</a>]  it's really, really interesting,

[<a id="00-05-08">00:05:08</a>]  especially when they get nitty-gritty

[<a id="00-05-10">00:05:10</a>]  and explain warfare part.

[<a id="00-05-12">00:05:12</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="00-05-13">00:05:13</a>]  - Why one side, one more?

[<a id="00-05-16">00:05:16</a>]  And I think, I love these guys, the Swiss pikemen,

[<a id="00-05-20">00:05:20</a>]  these guys with their spears and their muskets

[<a id="00-05-22">00:05:22</a>]  and things like that.

[<a id="00-05-23">00:05:23</a>]  - Yeah. - Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-24">00:05:24</a>]  - I knew this guy once, actually,

[<a id="00-05-26">00:05:26</a>]  from my kid's primary school.

[<a id="00-05-28">00:05:28</a>]  He'd been one of the Pope's guards.

[<a id="00-05-31">00:05:31</a>]  - Yeah, they still have Swiss guards there, yeah.

[<a id="00-05-33">00:05:33</a>]  - Yeah, and that was a good deal

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  'cause you only have to do it, it's like sport.

[<a id="00-05-38">00:05:38</a>]  You only do it until a certain age

[<a id="00-05-40">00:05:40</a>]  where you're fit enough to protect the Pope.

[<a id="00-05-43">00:05:43</a>]  And then they--

[<a id="00-05-46">00:05:46</a>]  - How did that tradition start?

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  Did the Swiss become like a pre-carrying guard?

[<a id="00-05-50">00:05:50</a>]  Is that what you call them in the Roman zone?

[<a id="00-05-52">00:05:52</a>]  - Kind of, yeah.

[<a id="00-05-53">00:05:53</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-53">00:05:53</a>]  - Actually, I don't know.

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  I guess, I mean, the myth of Swiss mercenaries

[<a id="00-05-59">00:05:59</a>]  is that they always, they never switched sides.

[<a id="00-06-03">00:06:03</a>]  So there was one famous battle where all the,

[<a id="00-06-05">00:06:05</a>]  and I can't remember which,

[<a id="00-06-06">00:06:06</a>]  where all the Swiss mercenaries stood by their employer

[<a id="00-06-10">00:06:10</a>]  and died to the last man.

[<a id="00-06-12">00:06:12</a>]  And that's why--

[<a id="00-06-15">00:06:15</a>]  - They have a reputation.

[<a id="00-06-16">00:06:16</a>]  - Yeah, like we've done a business deal here,

[<a id="00-06-19">00:06:19</a>]  we keep our contract.

[<a id="00-06-21">00:06:21</a>]  And then, I don't know how it became the tradition

[<a id="00-06-24">00:06:24</a>]  with the Vatican.

[<a id="00-06-26">00:06:26</a>]  But this guy, he'd retired at the age of 25.

[<a id="00-06-30">00:06:30</a>]  He's getting pension for life.

[<a id="00-06-33">00:06:33</a>]  And he never really had to work again.

[<a id="00-06-37">00:06:37</a>]  I mean, he was trying to find things to do.

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  But in retrospect, now I would have asked him about,

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  what did you see the Catholic priest getting up to

[<a id="00-06-46">00:06:46</a>]  while you were there?

[<a id="00-06-49">00:06:49</a>]  Probably, he would never tell

[<a id="00-06-50">00:06:50</a>]  because he's a vow of secrecy.

[<a id="00-06-53">00:06:53</a>]  But in retrospect, he was always a little bit too happy

[<a id="00-06-58">00:06:58</a>]  when he was at the primary school.

[<a id="00-07-03">00:07:03</a>]  And maybe, yeah, luckily my kids weren't friends with his.

[<a id="00-07-08">00:07:08</a>]  Remember how energetic I was in the first one?

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  - Yeah, now it's--

[<a id="00-07-11">00:07:11</a>]  - Now, the sleeping thing's coming back again, you know?

[<a id="00-07-14">00:07:14</a>]  And that's--

[<a id="00-07-15">00:07:15</a>]  - All right, then we'll take it easy.

[<a id="00-07-18">00:07:18</a>]  - No, no, no.

[<a id="00-07-19">00:07:19</a>]  - Tell me, what's the T-shirt?

[<a id="00-07-21">00:07:21</a>]  What is it?

[<a id="00-07-25">00:07:25</a>]  - It's a movie by a guy named Obayashi, we had a movie.

[<a id="00-07-29">00:07:29</a>]  And this is one of Bill Hader's favorite movie.

[<a id="00-07-32">00:07:32</a>]  And the movie was created when the director, Obayashi,

[<a id="00-07-35">00:07:35</a>]  talked to his 12-year-old daughter.

[<a id="00-07-36">00:07:36</a>]  And this house, house, as Japanese would call it,

[<a id="00-07-40">00:07:40</a>]  it's kind of haunted, that's a lot of crazy stuff

[<a id="00-07-42">00:07:42</a>]  with really crazy, no logic at all.

[<a id="00-07-45">00:07:45</a>]  It's a really great film and it's weird,

[<a id="00-07-48">00:07:48</a>]  but it's one of those cult classic, you know?

[<a id="00-07-50">00:07:50</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-07-51">00:07:51</a>]  - I kind of like, I really like what he did

[<a id="00-07-55">00:07:55</a>]  because he listened to his daughter

[<a id="00-07-57">00:07:57</a>]  and this 12-year-old girl is telling all this terrible thing

[<a id="00-07-59">00:07:59</a>]  that only makes sense to a 12-year-old child, you know?

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  And the fact that dad made this sweet,

[<a id="00-08-07">00:08:07</a>]  horrific film, I guess, you know, it's a fun one.

[<a id="00-08-11">00:08:11</a>]  But yeah, I got that T-shirt.

[<a id="00-08-13">00:08:13</a>]  And I remember when Bill Hader was doing

[<a id="00-08-15">00:08:15</a>]  one of those Criterion thing

[<a id="00-08-17">00:08:17</a>]  where he picked five DVDs that he likes, you know?

[<a id="00-08-19">00:08:19</a>]  I really like him, obviously he's a very talented guy,

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  but I especially like his love of cinema, you know?

[<a id="00-08-28">00:08:28</a>]  So it's really fun to listen to a guy like him,

[<a id="00-08-30">00:08:30</a>]  Tarantino and people like that talk about movies

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  because they will give interpretation or a point of view

[<a id="00-08-36">00:08:36</a>]  or a taste for something that is like,

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  wow, it's really interesting and educating

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  and entertaining to hear people talk about that, you know?

[<a id="00-08-44">00:08:44</a>]  - Yeah, absolutely.

[<a id="00-08-45">00:08:45</a>]  - But yeah, going back,

[<a id="00-08-47">00:08:47</a>]  those warfare stuff, you know, in Europe,

[<a id="00-08-53">00:08:53</a>]  it's really interesting.

[<a id="00-08-55">00:08:55</a>]  The Swiss and Germans, I mean,

[<a id="00-08-59">00:08:59</a>]  they just seem to have always great reputation

[<a id="00-09-01">00:09:01</a>]  when it comes to fighting, you know?

[<a id="00-09-03">00:09:03</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-09-05">00:09:05</a>]  I mean, yeah, it's interesting.

[<a id="00-09-08">00:09:08</a>]  That is interesting because--

[<a id="00-09-10">00:09:10</a>]  - General Eisenhower was also German-American, you know?

[<a id="00-09-13">00:09:13</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-09-14">00:09:14</a>]  - Yeah, but you go places like where

[<a id="00-09-17">00:09:17</a>]  Germanic type of Americans, German-American types,

[<a id="00-09-23">00:09:23</a>]  or German adjacent, I know Polish people don't like it,

[<a id="00-09-27">00:09:27</a>]  I might even put him like, you know,

[<a id="00-09-28">00:09:28</a>]  they've been invaded so they're kind of German-ish,

[<a id="00-09-31">00:09:31</a>]  but these big, German-looking kids

[<a id="00-09-35">00:09:35</a>]  playing American football,

[<a id="00-09-36">00:09:36</a>]  it's always fun to see those kids playing

[<a id="00-09-37">00:09:37</a>]  'cause they're big-ass, disciplined,

[<a id="00-09-39">00:09:39</a>]  they're good at what they do,

[<a id="00-09-41">00:09:41</a>]  and I always think about the Swiss guards

[<a id="00-09-44">00:09:44</a>]  and German fighters, you know?

[<a id="00-09-46">00:09:46</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-47">00:09:47</a>]  - And that goes back way back when Julius Caesar invaded

[<a id="00-09-50">00:09:50</a>]  that area known as Germany, but you know.

[<a id="00-09-52">00:09:52</a>]  - Yeah, exactly.

[<a id="00-09-54">00:09:54</a>]  I mean, it's interesting 'cause the,

[<a id="00-09-57">00:09:57</a>]  my brother is, he's always been interested in history,

[<a id="00-10-02">00:10:02</a>]  so he used to go around collecting,

[<a id="00-10-05">00:10:05</a>]  he used to go to these markets.

[<a id="00-10-06">00:10:06</a>]  In England, you can buy all the,

[<a id="00-10-09">00:10:09</a>]  you go to flea markets,

[<a id="00-10-10">00:10:10</a>]  you can get all the World War II memorabilia

[<a id="00-10-14">00:10:14</a>]  that you could never buy in Germany.

[<a id="00-10-15">00:10:15</a>]  Like, you can buy a Nazi helmet

[<a id="00-10-18">00:10:18</a>]  and you've got all these English guys collecting the shit.

[<a id="00-10-21">00:10:21</a>]  And yeah, I don't know, I mean, we could go talk about that,

[<a id="00-10-27">00:10:27</a>]  but like the, I mean, to me it's interesting right now

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  because this whole Ukraine conflict.

[<a id="00-10-34">00:10:34</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-10-36">00:10:36</a>]  - What I understood is that the American military adopted

[<a id="00-10-39">00:10:39</a>]  many of the ideas of the Nazis

[<a id="00-10-42">00:10:42</a>]  and how you outmaneuver an opponent,

[<a id="00-10-45">00:10:45</a>]  like go around, do these pincers, all this kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-10-48">00:10:48</a>]  Unfortunately, they're going up against--

[<a id="00-10-50">00:10:50</a>]  - I mean, I think there's similar kind of things,

[<a id="00-10-52">00:10:52</a>]  I think, when beginning of World War II, the blitz, right?

[<a id="00-10-57">00:10:57</a>]  Which you're also going back to American football

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  where we like blitz, you know, and--

[<a id="00-11-03">00:11:03</a>]  - But what they're forgetting is that

[<a id="00-11-05">00:11:05</a>]  what's the country that the Germans lost to?

[<a id="00-11-08">00:11:08</a>]  And it wasn't really America,

[<a id="00-11-09">00:11:09</a>]  it was the Russians that beat the Germans.

[<a id="00-11-12">00:11:12</a>]  - I think anytime you have, I mean,

[<a id="00-11-13">00:11:13</a>]  I'm not an expert in military history 'cause I'm not,

[<a id="00-11-16">00:11:16</a>]  but I mean, we could just say about any conflict,

[<a id="00-11-19">00:11:19</a>]  they always learn something to do better next time,

[<a id="00-11-22">00:11:22</a>]  including innovation in medical and medicine, right?

[<a id="00-11-26">00:11:26</a>]  Like during the American Civil War,

[<a id="00-11-29">00:11:29</a>]  they learned the hard lesson

[<a id="00-11-30">00:11:30</a>]  that you're supposed to have hygienic equipment

[<a id="00-11-32">00:11:32</a>]  when you're doing surgical things and things like that,

[<a id="00-11-34">00:11:34</a>]  you know?

[<a id="00-11-35">00:11:35</a>]  It's sad that when these terrible things happen,

[<a id="00-11-38">00:11:38</a>]  we will learn stuff, you know?

[<a id="00-11-39">00:11:39</a>]  So as much as people talk about how much Chinese

[<a id="00-11-43">00:11:43</a>]  are spending their resource building their military,

[<a id="00-11-46">00:11:46</a>]  but here's the thing, they haven't fought in a long time,

[<a id="00-11-48">00:11:48</a>]  you know?

[<a id="00-11-49">00:11:49</a>]  There's something to say about experience in fighting

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  and training and things like that.

[<a id="00-11-54">00:11:54</a>]  You could do all kinds of like a fake maneuvering

[<a id="00-11-56">00:11:56</a>]  and buying the best equipment, but as you know,

[<a id="00-11-59">00:11:59</a>]  anytime you see people fighting in the streets,

[<a id="00-12-02">00:12:02</a>]  it's never looking like John Wick, you know?

[<a id="00-12-05">00:12:05</a>]  It's not as pretty as people think it is.

[<a id="00-12-08">00:12:08</a>]  And going to war, it doesn't look like Top Gun or--

[<a id="00-12-11">00:12:11</a>]  - That's the classic English maneuver, by the way.

[<a id="00-12-13">00:12:13</a>]  It's the English head butt,

[<a id="00-12-16">00:12:16</a>]  and nobody's ready for that shit.

[<a id="00-12-19">00:12:19</a>]  And if you, like the violence in England I grew up with,

[<a id="00-12-23">00:12:23</a>]  you just, like I got beaten up when I was 18

[<a id="00-12-28">00:12:28</a>]  walking back from a pub.

[<a id="00-12-29">00:12:29</a>]  These three dudes jumped me.

[<a id="00-12-33">00:12:33</a>]  - Of course.

[<a id="00-12-33">00:12:33</a>]  - For no, there was no, I didn't even see them coming.

[<a id="00-12-36">00:12:36</a>]  And then--

[<a id="00-12-37">00:12:37</a>]  - Is that a money thing, or they just wanna kick your ass?

[<a id="00-12-39">00:12:39</a>]  - They were on, I think they were on speed.

[<a id="00-12-41">00:12:41</a>]  - Oh.

[<a id="00-12-41">00:12:41</a>]  - And yeah, but it's like, after pub violence

[<a id="00-12-46">00:12:46</a>]  is a sport.

[<a id="00-12-47">00:12:47</a>]  It's just like, there's people, it's like,

[<a id="00-12-49">00:12:49</a>]  that's a Friday night.

[<a id="00-12-50">00:12:50</a>]  They go out, they get wasted,

[<a id="00-12-51">00:12:51</a>]  they go and beat the fuck out of someone.

[<a id="00-12-53">00:12:53</a>]  The police caught these guys straight away

[<a id="00-12-55">00:12:55</a>]  and ended up paying for my second year of university.

[<a id="00-12-58">00:12:58</a>]  - Look, I'm anti-war, but I have to admit,

[<a id="00-13-01">00:13:01</a>]  like the previous stuff we were talking,

[<a id="00-13-04">00:13:04</a>]  like, you don't wanna go out of your way

[<a id="00-13-08">00:13:08</a>]  to make your kid's life miserable,

[<a id="00-13-10">00:13:10</a>]  but if you make too comfortable,

[<a id="00-13-11">00:13:11</a>]  then you're setting up some,

[<a id="00-13-15">00:13:15</a>]  it's not problem and disappointment,

[<a id="00-13-17">00:13:17</a>]  but you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-13-18">00:13:18</a>]  Like, they should have some conflict.

[<a id="00-13-19">00:13:19</a>]  They learn to manage and take care of themselves,

[<a id="00-13-22">00:13:22</a>]  but you know what I'm trying to say?

[<a id="00-13-23">00:13:23</a>]  You're like, too comfortable is kind of bad,

[<a id="00-13-25">00:13:25</a>]  but too miserable is bad too.

[<a id="00-13-27">00:13:27</a>]  I don't know what's the happy medium, you know?

[<a id="00-13-31">00:13:31</a>]  - This is gonna be really interesting

[<a id="00-13-33">00:13:33</a>]  when like this generation starts hitting 40,

[<a id="00-13-36">00:13:36</a>]  'cause once you start getting your first medical issues,

[<a id="00-13-39">00:13:39</a>]  is where you get some genuine sense of mortality.

[<a id="00-13-42">00:13:42</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-13-43">00:13:43</a>]  - I've been feeling it the last 15 years.

[<a id="00-13-45">00:13:45</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-13-46">00:13:46</a>]  And no matter how good your life was or how protected,

[<a id="00-13-50">00:13:50</a>]  there's a point where it ends up in death.

[<a id="00-13-53">00:13:53</a>]  And most people, I think, in a safe country,

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  don't have a quick, easy death.

[<a id="00-14-00">00:14:00</a>]  They have a long, painful, drawn-out decline in hospital

[<a id="00-14-04">00:14:04</a>]  where they're pumping you up with morphine

[<a id="00-14-07">00:14:07</a>]  until the morphine stops working.

[<a id="00-14-08">00:14:08</a>]  - Oh, I see what you're saying.

[<a id="00-14-10">00:14:10</a>]  - So for most people in the Western countries,

[<a id="00-14-13">00:14:13</a>]  it's not like a, you'd hope to be, you know,

[<a id="00-14-16">00:14:16</a>]  I'd actually kind of like to die in a nuclear war,

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  'cause that's a bomb drops.

[<a id="00-14-21">00:14:21</a>]  You go from alive to dead in a very quick time.

[<a id="00-14-25">00:14:25</a>]  - I wonder if I could go back in time,

[<a id="00-14-30">00:14:30</a>]  my genetic ancestors, year 2000, I mean, year 1000,

[<a id="00-14-34">00:14:34</a>]  would they have lived 55 years still?

[<a id="00-14-39">00:14:39</a>]  I don't know.

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  I'm not very confident.

[<a id="00-14-41">00:14:41</a>]  I'm sure they're peasants and some shit like that, you know.

[<a id="00-14-45">00:14:45</a>]  There's a stat I heard once from some history podcasts

[<a id="00-14-50">00:14:50</a>]  where they say we think in the Middle Ages

[<a id="00-14-54">00:14:54</a>]  or 1,000 years ago that the average lifespan was low.

[<a id="00-14-59">00:14:59</a>]  But in fact, the stats are ruined

[<a id="00-15-02">00:15:02</a>]  by the amount of infant mortality.

[<a id="00-15-05">00:15:05</a>]  - I see.

[<a id="00-15-05">00:15:05</a>]  - That a lot of people, if you made it past

[<a id="00-15-08">00:15:08</a>]  the first sort of 12 years,

[<a id="00-15-10">00:15:10</a>]  then you actually lived similar lifespan to what we do now.

[<a id="00-15-15">00:15:15</a>]  - I also read, I don't know who said this.

[<a id="00-15-17">00:15:17</a>]  It's not me, obviously.

[<a id="00-15-19">00:15:19</a>]  It's a smart thing to say, but Marguerite Mead,

[<a id="00-15-22">00:15:22</a>]  one of those anthropologists said like,

[<a id="00-15-24">00:15:24</a>]  what is the first sign of civilization, you know?

[<a id="00-15-28">00:15:28</a>]  And I don't know.

[<a id="00-15-30">00:15:30</a>]  I thought they were gonna say something like,

[<a id="00-15-32">00:15:32</a>]  granary, so they were able to save all the food from farming

[<a id="00-15-37">00:15:37</a>]  or I don't know, certain types of building

[<a id="00-15-42">00:15:42</a>]  or innovation in and like, I don't know.

[<a id="00-15-47">00:15:47</a>]  Just something basic that keeps you alive.

[<a id="00-15-48">00:15:48</a>]  But this person, I think it was a woman,

[<a id="00-15-51">00:15:51</a>]  she said something about when they discovered bones

[<a id="00-15-56">00:15:56</a>]  and clearly was injured but was able to later on heal.

[<a id="00-16-02">00:16:02</a>]  And I think that is a sign that that is a group of people

[<a id="00-16-07">00:16:07</a>]  who have civilization where they're thinking group

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  and they're willing to support that person

[<a id="00-16-14">00:16:14</a>]  instead of let them die like the other animal.

[<a id="00-16-16">00:16:16</a>]  You know how animals that they're traveling once,

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  two week and they can't follow,

[<a id="00-16-19">00:16:19</a>]  they just let them die and just continue to move on.

[<a id="00-16-22">00:16:22</a>]  And I think that that is an interesting point.

[<a id="00-16-25">00:16:25</a>]  I think that makes sense.

[<a id="00-16-26">00:16:26</a>]  Like, oh, this person clearly broke his or her leg,

[<a id="00-16-30">00:16:30</a>]  was able to heal.

[<a id="00-16-32">00:16:32</a>]  That is the sign of civilization.

[<a id="00-16-34">00:16:34</a>]  This idea of teamwork and cooperation, things like that.

[<a id="00-16-39">00:16:39</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-16-40">00:16:40</a>]  Yeah, that's interesting.

[<a id="00-16-42">00:16:42</a>]  - Makes sense, I think.

[<a id="00-16-43">00:16:43</a>]  And clearly, it's just somebody smart

[<a id="00-16-45">00:16:45</a>]  and I'm just repeating what smart people are saying.

[<a id="00-16-49">00:16:49</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, that's all the podcasts basically.

[<a id="00-16-54">00:16:54</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-54">00:16:54</a>]  - I could at this point, like, I mean,

[<a id="00-16-58">00:16:58</a>]  what's impressive about you is you have a lot of sources

[<a id="00-17-03">00:17:03</a>]  that you can quote.

[<a id="00-17-04">00:17:04</a>]  I've always just absorbed things.

[<a id="00-17-09">00:17:09</a>]  - I think it's a problem because I don't think

[<a id="00-17-11">00:17:11</a>]  there's a value for what I do and I'm not valuable at all

[<a id="00-17-14">00:17:14</a>]  because I think, for example, you, computer programming,

[<a id="00-17-17">00:17:17</a>]  this is a highly sought after skills

[<a id="00-17-19">00:17:19</a>]  and you could do stuff.

[<a id="00-17-20">00:17:20</a>]  I could sit on the podcast not getting paid

[<a id="00-17-23">00:17:23</a>]  and then be good for whoever's recording, I guess.

[<a id="00-17-26">00:17:26</a>]  But sometimes I wish I knew how to do something

[<a id="00-17-31">00:17:31</a>]  'cause I don't know anything, you know.

[<a id="00-17-33">00:17:33</a>]  - But that--

[<a id="00-17-34">00:17:34</a>]  - I only know superficial stuff 'cause I live in LA.

[<a id="00-17-37">00:17:37</a>]  It's such a--

[<a id="00-17-37">00:17:37</a>]  - But that, what you could do with that is start a cult.

[<a id="00-17-41">00:17:41</a>]  That's, that's--

[<a id="00-17-43">00:17:43</a>]  - I don't think so 'cause shitty personality

[<a id="00-17-45">00:17:45</a>]  and you have to be able to,

[<a id="00-17-47">00:17:47</a>]  like when I went to Waco, Texas where David Koresh died,

[<a id="00-17-50">00:17:50</a>]  I've been to that church multiple times

[<a id="00-17-51">00:17:51</a>]  and here's a guy, poor, but freakishly knowledgeable of Bible

[<a id="00-17-59">00:17:59</a>]  and remember everything and was charismatic, you know.

[<a id="00-18-02">00:18:02</a>]  - Yeah, but you've got, your cult would be--

[<a id="00-18-07">00:18:07</a>]  - It's just incredible managerial skill to start a cult,

[<a id="00-18-10">00:18:10</a>]  you know, like, I know it's a negative thing to say,

[<a id="00-18-12">00:18:12</a>]  starting a cult, but that person at least

[<a id="00-18-15">00:18:15</a>]  have a pretty good people skill to do that.

[<a id="00-18-17">00:18:17</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, charisma. - Yeah, I don't have that.

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  - Yeah, but that doesn't matter because you need,

[<a id="00-18-23">00:18:23</a>]  or you've got the philosophy, so you got,

[<a id="00-18-25">00:18:25</a>]  my philosophy is not having any value

[<a id="00-18-28">00:18:28</a>]  and that's what we build the cult of people

[<a id="00-18-29">00:18:29</a>]  that have no value. - But isn't that a value?

[<a id="00-18-32">00:18:32</a>]  - Yeah, but that's the paradox.

[<a id="00-18-35">00:18:35</a>]  That's what, when you get to level seven,

[<a id="00-18-37">00:18:37</a>]  that's when you discover--

[<a id="00-18-38">00:18:38</a>]  - 'Cause when they say somebody's nihilist,

[<a id="00-18-40">00:18:40</a>]  like you don't believe anything,

[<a id="00-18-41">00:18:41</a>]  well, that is a belief, right?

[<a id="00-18-42">00:18:42</a>]  Like you don't believe in nothing,

[<a id="00-18-44">00:18:44</a>]  but that is a belief in something.

[<a id="00-18-45">00:18:45</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  - I don't want to get too technical, but you know.

[<a id="00-18-50">00:18:50</a>]  - But yeah, and there was a different,

[<a id="00-18-57">00:18:57</a>]  I've just dropped the ball.

[<a id="00-18-58">00:18:58</a>]  - 'Cause, you know, I think we hit it off

[<a id="00-19-03">00:19:03</a>]  because we're just old fart, we run,

[<a id="00-19-06">00:19:06</a>]  I'm older than you, but within four or five years

[<a id="00-19-09">00:19:09</a>]  or whatnot, and then within three,

[<a id="00-19-13">00:19:13</a>]  it's really weird 'cause my brother's three years younger

[<a id="00-19-15">00:19:15</a>]  than myself, we're so unrelatable.

[<a id="00-19-18">00:19:18</a>]  He doesn't know any of the things I know,

[<a id="00-19-19">00:19:19</a>]  like basic history and things like that, he doesn't care.

[<a id="00-19-22">00:19:22</a>]  But he has fun and he still skateboards.

[<a id="00-19-24">00:19:24</a>]  - Wow. - At the 50 plus years old.

[<a id="00-19-27">00:19:27</a>]  But we're completely different.

[<a id="00-19-29">00:19:29</a>]  The way Russell Peters and his older brother

[<a id="00-19-31">00:19:31</a>]  is so fucking different.

[<a id="00-19-32">00:19:32</a>]  - Wow. - You know?

[<a id="00-19-34">00:19:34</a>]  - What does your brother do?

[<a id="00-19-36">00:19:36</a>]  - He still helps my mom with her restaurant,

[<a id="00-19-38">00:19:38</a>]  but he still skateboard the fuck out of it.

[<a id="00-19-40">00:19:40</a>]  I mean, better than even most of those young kids, you know?

[<a id="00-19-44">00:19:44</a>]  'Cause he does, I guess he does a lot of tricks

[<a id="00-19-46">00:19:46</a>]  that is complicated and original, but--

[<a id="00-19-50">00:19:50</a>]  - He's also called Yoshi.

[<a id="00-19-52">00:19:52</a>]  'Cause I searched for you once

[<a id="00-19-54">00:19:54</a>]  and found your brother skateboarding.

[<a id="00-19-56">00:19:56</a>]  His name is Yoshihiro, but it's too hard

[<a id="00-19-57">00:19:57</a>]  for people to say, so they just made Yoshi,

[<a id="00-19-59">00:19:59</a>]  and mine's Yoshikazu, but it was hard, so Yoshi.

[<a id="00-20-03">00:20:03</a>]  But we didn't really hang out with together,

[<a id="00-20-05">00:20:05</a>]  but that's where the confusion come from.

[<a id="00-20-06">00:20:06</a>]  'Cause sometimes I get an email text saying,

[<a id="00-20-08">00:20:08</a>]  hey, are you a skater, skater?

[<a id="00-20-10">00:20:10</a>]  Like, oh no, that's my younger brother.

[<a id="00-20-12">00:20:12</a>]  And sometimes somebody would ask,

[<a id="00-20-13">00:20:13</a>]  are you the comedian?

[<a id="00-20-14">00:20:14</a>]  Like, no, that's my brother, right?

[<a id="00-20-15">00:20:15</a>]  - Yeah, yeah. - So, yeah.

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  - Yeah, but shit, my brain's shutting down as well.

[<a id="00-20-22">00:20:22</a>]  - No, no, I'm fucking getting sleepy, but--

[<a id="00-20-24">00:20:24</a>]  - Actually, yeah, no, there was something,

[<a id="00-20-26">00:20:26</a>]  you were saying something that,

[<a id="00-20-27">00:20:27</a>]  'cause, you know, you're saying like computer programming,

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  you can do something that is valuable.

[<a id="00-20-33">00:20:33</a>]  The thing, part of the thing,

[<a id="00-20-35">00:20:35</a>]  the reason why I started doing,

[<a id="00-20-36">00:20:36</a>]  one of the reasons I started doing comedy--

[<a id="00-20-38">00:20:38</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-39">00:20:39</a>]  - Or, it's not, it was getting laid, of course.

[<a id="00-20-43">00:20:43</a>]  And in this city, basically all the men

[<a id="00-20-46">00:20:46</a>]  are either bankers or working in IT.

[<a id="00-20-49">00:20:49</a>]  I went to a cafe--

[<a id="00-20-50">00:20:50</a>]  - There's nothing in between, really?

[<a id="00-20-51">00:20:51</a>]  - There's other stuff, there's cooks and, you know,

[<a id="00-20-54">00:20:54</a>]  but the majority of, the well-paid jobs

[<a id="00-20-56">00:20:56</a>]  are in banking and IT, and--

[<a id="00-20-59">00:20:59</a>]  - Which is higher, IT or banking?

[<a id="00-21-01">00:21:01</a>]  - Banking. - Wow.

[<a id="00-21-03">00:21:03</a>]  - But it's riskier as well,

[<a id="00-21-04">00:21:04</a>]  'cause they, every now and again,

[<a id="00-21-06">00:21:06</a>]  Credit Suisse collapses and everybody gets fired.

[<a id="00-21-10">00:21:10</a>]  The IT jobs are more stable.

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  - Credit Suisse, they are the biggest bank in Switzerland?

[<a id="00-21-15">00:21:15</a>]  - UBS, the--

[<a id="00-21-16">00:21:16</a>]  - Ah, did they just buy somebody out

[<a id="00-21-18">00:21:18</a>]  because they're having--

[<a id="00-21-19">00:21:19</a>]  - They bought Credit Suisse.

[<a id="00-21-21">00:21:21</a>]  Credit Suisse was somehow tied up in

[<a id="00-21-24">00:21:24</a>]  all these junk mortgage investments,

[<a id="00-21-27">00:21:27</a>]  and after the last collapse--

[<a id="00-21-30">00:21:30</a>]  - Are we talking like around 2007, '08?

[<a id="00-21-32">00:21:32</a>]  Were we talking that era?

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  - Oh, shit.

[<a id="00-21-34">00:21:34</a>]  - I forget when Credit Suisse,

[<a id="00-21-35">00:21:35</a>]  Credit Suisse collapsed finally later,

[<a id="00-21-38">00:21:38</a>]  and then for the government-funded,

[<a id="00-21-43">00:21:43</a>]  backed UBS to take over Credit Suisse.

[<a id="00-21-46">00:21:46</a>]  - What's UBS stands for, do you know?

[<a id="00-21-48">00:21:48</a>]  - Union Bank Switzerland, I think.

[<a id="00-21-50">00:21:50</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-21-52">00:21:52</a>]  - Yeah, so they're UBS,

[<a id="00-21-54">00:21:54</a>]  but never put your money in either of those,

[<a id="00-21-57">00:21:57</a>]  'cause they do, they're one of these banks doing risky shit.

[<a id="00-22-01">00:22:01</a>]  I keep my money in the Swiss Post Finance,

[<a id="00-22-06">00:22:06</a>]  and also some of the, what are called the cantonal banks,

[<a id="00-22-10">00:22:10</a>]  and they're not allowed to do dodgy investments.

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  They just have to keep your money,

[<a id="00-22-17">00:22:17</a>]  so you don't get a bank run one day.

[<a id="00-22-19">00:22:19</a>]  I know UBS is just, and Credit Suisse were all renowned.

[<a id="00-22-24">00:22:24</a>]  I know places like Bank of Edinburgh, Bank of Scotland,

[<a id="00-22-29">00:22:29</a>]  and the one in England.

[<a id="00-22-32">00:22:32</a>]  They've been around for a long fucking time, and--

[<a id="00-22-35">00:22:35</a>]  - And the HSBC as well, the Hong Kong, yeah.

[<a id="00-22-40">00:22:40</a>]  - Hong Kong Banking, oh, the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Court.

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  HSBC, yeah.

[<a id="00-22-47">00:22:47</a>]  - And they were created for selling drugs to China.

[<a id="00-22-52">00:22:52</a>]  They were financing the Opium War.

[<a id="00-22-54">00:22:54</a>]  People forget that.

[<a id="00-22-55">00:22:55</a>]  - I know, honestly, when most of the stuff were like,

[<a id="00-23-02">00:23:02</a>]  we were talking about enemies, where it's like, you know--

[<a id="00-23-06">00:23:06</a>]  - Problem was English people didn't have anything

[<a id="00-23-07">00:23:07</a>]  the Chinese wanted, so they brought opium.

[<a id="00-23-10">00:23:10</a>]  - Yeah, exactly, and if I was,

[<a id="00-23-13">00:23:13</a>]  if somebody did that to my family,

[<a id="00-23-16">00:23:16</a>]  I'm gonna fucking kill that person.

[<a id="00-23-19">00:23:19</a>]  So you get my daughter addicted to opium.

[<a id="00-23-22">00:23:22</a>]  I'm gonna tell, like for generations, we're gonna see.

[<a id="00-23-27">00:23:27</a>]  If you ever see that, any of their people, you fuck 'em up.

[<a id="00-23-31">00:23:31</a>]  Which is why, which I think--

[<a id="00-23-32">00:23:32</a>]  - Which is laughable, because what happened in the,

[<a id="00-23-35">00:23:35</a>]  who was making painkillers in the USA?

[<a id="00-23-37">00:23:37</a>]  Why am I forgetting that family?

[<a id="00-23-39">00:23:39</a>]  - Oh, it's Saxler.

[<a id="00-23-40">00:23:40</a>]  - Yeah, same thing, it just,

[<a id="00-23-43">00:23:43</a>]  instead of state-sanctioned drug operation,

[<a id="00-23-46">00:23:46</a>]  like British Empire, it's just a family.

[<a id="00-23-50">00:23:50</a>]  - Are they Asian?

[<a id="00-23-53">00:23:53</a>]  - No, they're just a family in the United States,

[<a id="00-23-56">00:23:56</a>]  but it's the same formula, isn't it?

[<a id="00-24-00">00:24:00</a>]  Like, they knew it's harmful, but they made money anyway,

[<a id="00-24-03">00:24:03</a>]  and later won.

[<a id="00-24-05">00:24:05</a>]  I remember in college, you know,

[<a id="00-24-07">00:24:07</a>]  econ class, I was shocked how much I liked econ,

[<a id="00-24-13">00:24:13</a>]  because it generated these deviant questions

[<a id="00-24-16">00:24:16</a>]  when you take econ, like comedy.

[<a id="00-24-18">00:24:18</a>]  - Yeah, amoral, just--

[<a id="00-24-20">00:24:20</a>]  - Yeah, and just something that kinda covered Breaking Bad,

[<a id="00-24-23">00:24:23</a>]  where Walter Weiss' character is so rational and smart.

[<a id="00-24-26">00:24:26</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-24-27">00:24:27</a>]  - You know, questions like when I was taking econ, like,

[<a id="00-24-30">00:24:30</a>]  and I had a really good teacher.

[<a id="00-24-33">00:24:33</a>]  He basically said, "Look, you're running four motors,

[<a id="00-24-36">00:24:36</a>]  "and you know that there's a defect, brakes.

[<a id="00-24-40">00:24:40</a>]  "If you did recall, you're gonna lose five billion,

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  "but if you don't pretend like everything's okay,

[<a id="00-24-44">00:24:44</a>]  "and there's accident, and people are getting killed,

[<a id="00-24-48">00:24:48</a>]  "but you're gonna lose billion,"

[<a id="00-24-50">00:24:50</a>]  there's this, like, the whole neoliberal way of thinking,

[<a id="00-24-53">00:24:53</a>]  like, well, maybe it is just not to pretend

[<a id="00-24-55">00:24:55</a>]  like everything's okay, and pay billion, you know?

[<a id="00-24-58">00:24:58</a>]  And I think Secularists and opium wars,

[<a id="00-25-01">00:25:01</a>]  I think they justify in saying, like,

[<a id="00-25-03">00:25:03</a>]  "This is just a good business."

[<a id="00-25-05">00:25:05</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-25-06">00:25:06</a>]  - And those other unpleasant part is collateral damage,

[<a id="00-25-10">00:25:10</a>]  and you apologize, you put a lot of new ads,

[<a id="00-25-13">00:25:13</a>]  and then you turn around and put secular

[<a id="00-25-15">00:25:15</a>]  at all the different museums and schools,

[<a id="00-25-16">00:25:16</a>]  and people forget, you know?

[<a id="00-25-17">00:25:17</a>]  - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-25-18">00:25:18</a>]  - I mean, famously, Duke University in North Carolina,

[<a id="00-25-23">00:25:23</a>]  they have an amazing science and medical school.

[<a id="00-25-28">00:25:28</a>]  They were all paid by cigarette bodies, you know?

[<a id="00-25-30">00:25:30</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-25-31">00:25:31</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-32">00:25:32</a>]  - Just like Nobel Prize, I mean, everybody knows, like,

[<a id="00-25-36">00:25:36</a>]  that in Oslo, Norway, those Nobel Prize money

[<a id="00-25-41">00:25:41</a>]  was originally started with dynamite, you know?

[<a id="00-25-43">00:25:43</a>]  - That's actually beautiful,

[<a id="00-25-45">00:25:45</a>]  and you know the famous Louis C.K. bit?

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  - Yeah, which one?

[<a id="00-25-49">00:25:49</a>]  - The one where--

[<a id="00-25-50">00:25:50</a>]  - There's so many.

[<a id="00-25-51">00:25:51</a>]  - Yeah, but the one of "of course, but maybe,"

[<a id="00-25-55">00:25:55</a>]  where he's going on, he's basically saying--

[<a id="00-25-58">00:25:58</a>]  - Oh, yeah.

[<a id="00-26-00">00:26:00</a>]  - Yeah, like peanut, but his end is, like,

[<a id="00-26-02">00:26:02</a>]  "Maybe, of course, like, it's terrible

[<a id="00-26-05">00:26:05</a>]  what's happening, essentially,

[<a id="00-26-07">00:26:07</a>]  with people throwing themselves out of business,

[<a id="00-26-09">00:26:09</a>]  but maybe every great human achievement

[<a id="00-26-12">00:26:12</a>]  was just built on human tragedy."

[<a id="00-26-14">00:26:14</a>]  - Yes, then who said there's all civilization

[<a id="00-26-18">00:26:18</a>]  based on cruelty?

[<a id="00-26-19">00:26:19</a>]  Is it Nietzsche?

[<a id="00-26-20">00:26:20</a>]  Somebody said something like that.

[<a id="00-26-22">00:26:22</a>]  - I don't know, but yeah.

[<a id="00-26-23">00:26:23</a>]  - In "Third Man," I like that thing that they said

[<a id="00-26-26">00:26:26</a>]  in that movie always make me laugh,

[<a id="00-26-27">00:26:27</a>]  like Italians suffer 500 years of just bloodletting,

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  murder, betrayal, and disease, blah, blah, blah,

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  but look at all the amazing thing it has created.

[<a id="00-26-38">00:26:38</a>]  Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,

[<a id="00-26-41">00:26:41</a>]  and the opera, the technological advance,

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  even banking and book accounting,

[<a id="00-26-47">00:26:47</a>]  that shit come from Italy, too.

[<a id="00-26-49">00:26:49</a>]  Then you have Switzerland, which is very safe,

[<a id="00-26-52">00:26:52</a>]  and all you made is chocolate and a cuckoo bird clock,

[<a id="00-26-55">00:26:55</a>]  you know?

[<a id="00-26-56">00:26:56</a>]  - Well, I mean, the thing is that you're saying

[<a id="00-27-00">00:27:00</a>]  all these amazing things that maybe--

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  - No, no, I mean, I'm just repeating

[<a id="00-27-03">00:27:03</a>]  what other people are saying, you know?

[<a id="00-27-04">00:27:04</a>]  But actually, maybe all of that stuff is just bullshit,

[<a id="00-27-07">00:27:07</a>]  that we only find that stuff amazing

[<a id="00-27-11">00:27:11</a>]  because we traumatize the fuck out of ourselves

[<a id="00-27-13">00:27:13</a>]  in the first place.

[<a id="00-27-14">00:27:14</a>]  Like, if we just carried on just being like cows in a field,

[<a id="00-27-18">00:27:18</a>]  being happy, enjoy, yeah, look, there's some nature,

[<a id="00-27-21">00:27:21</a>]  let's just enjoy it.

[<a id="00-27-22">00:27:22</a>]  - There's plenty of people like that.

[<a id="00-27-23">00:27:23</a>]  - Then you wouldn't be impressed by Michelangelo.

[<a id="00-27-27">00:27:27</a>]  It's like, why the fuck did this guy paint on a ceiling?

[<a id="00-27-30">00:27:30</a>]  The sky's out there, it's way more beautiful.

[<a id="00-27-33">00:27:33</a>]  But I think, to Switzerland,

[<a id="00-27-37">00:27:37</a>]  Switzerland is a sneaky place.

[<a id="00-27-40">00:27:40</a>]  It's a very sneaky country.

[<a id="00-27-42">00:27:42</a>]  And the fact-- - What do you mean?

[<a id="00-27-44">00:27:44</a>]  - Everyone goes chocolate and cuckoo clocks.

[<a id="00-27-46">00:27:46</a>]  And that beautiful red flag of it looks cute

[<a id="00-27-50">00:27:50</a>]  and it looks like a beautifully designed logo.

[<a id="00-27-53">00:27:53</a>]  And that's-- - It is.

[<a id="00-27-55">00:27:55</a>]  - People don't ask deeper questions.

[<a id="00-27-57">00:27:57</a>]  And you're going to Basel tonight.

[<a id="00-28-02">00:28:02</a>]  - One of the things about,

[<a id="00-28-03">00:28:03</a>]  I learned this fairly recently--

[<a id="00-28-06">00:28:06</a>]  - Treaty of Basel ended that war in 1499.

[<a id="00-28-09">00:28:09</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-28-11">00:28:11</a>]  - But one of the things is that in the last 50 years,

[<a id="00-28-16">00:28:16</a>]  there was decisions made which Swiss cities get

[<a id="00-28-19">00:28:19</a>]  which industries.

[<a id="00-28-20">00:28:20</a>]  So Zurich got banking.

[<a id="00-28-22">00:28:22</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-28-23">00:28:23</a>]  - Lucerne got insurance.

[<a id="00-28-25">00:28:25</a>]  - Is that right?

[<a id="00-28-26">00:28:26</a>]  - Yeah, all the insurance companies

[<a id="00-28-29">00:28:29</a>]  have their headquarters in Lucerne.

[<a id="00-28-30">00:28:30</a>]  - I love this, okay.

[<a id="00-28-31">00:28:31</a>]  Basel is farmer.

[<a id="00-28-34">00:28:34</a>]  And you remember 9/11, of course, the Twin Towers.

[<a id="00-28-38">00:28:38</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-28-39">00:28:39</a>]  - When you get into Basel and you're on the train,

[<a id="00-28-41">00:28:41</a>]  watch as you're coming into Basel,

[<a id="00-28-43">00:28:43</a>]  there's now these two giant fucking towers.

[<a id="00-28-46">00:28:46</a>]  It's the Roche Towers from Roche, the farmer company.

[<a id="00-28-50">00:28:50</a>]  And-- - How do you spell that?

[<a id="00-28-51">00:28:51</a>]  - R-O-C-H-E.

[<a id="00-28-54">00:28:54</a>]  - Huh.

[<a id="00-28-54">00:28:54</a>]  - Roche or Roche.

[<a id="00-28-56">00:28:56</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-28-57">00:28:57</a>]  I've got a suspicious feeling

[<a id="00-28-58">00:28:58</a>]  that probably they wanted a study for them.

[<a id="00-29-00">00:29:00</a>]  - That's very likely.

[<a id="00-29-02">00:29:02</a>]  And yeah, you should get like a free,

[<a id="00-29-05">00:29:05</a>]  they should come and welcome you.

[<a id="00-29-07">00:29:07</a>]  - I've done plenty of Eli Lilly,

[<a id="00-29-08">00:29:08</a>]  and I've done a couple of German ones,

[<a id="00-29-10">00:29:10</a>]  well, a couple of Japanese plays, you know.

[<a id="00-29-12">00:29:12</a>]  I mean, for anybody hearing me for the first time,

[<a id="00-29-14">00:29:14</a>]  I'm not funny enough to make living doing comedy,

[<a id="00-29-17">00:29:17</a>]  so I have to do medical testing.

[<a id="00-29-19">00:29:19</a>]  And I've done plenty of those.

[<a id="00-29-21">00:29:21</a>]  - Well, what's interesting about this,

[<a id="00-29-23">00:29:23</a>]  before, before--

[<a id="00-29-26">00:29:26</a>]  - But before you say that,

[<a id="00-29-27">00:29:27</a>]  what other city have expertise in what?

[<a id="00-29-30">00:29:30</a>]  'Cause it's interesting.

[<a id="00-29-31">00:29:31</a>]  - So Geneva, I think, is charities.

[<a id="00-29-35">00:29:35</a>]  So like money laundering, basically.

[<a id="00-29-39">00:29:39</a>]  Charities in the UN.

[<a id="00-29-41">00:29:41</a>]  - Interesting, because-- - 'Cause NGOs--

[<a id="00-29-43">00:29:43</a>]  - I was gonna say, like, Geneva's all annoying people,

[<a id="00-29-45">00:29:45</a>]  because that's all French.

[<a id="00-29-47">00:29:47</a>]  I thought you were gonna say something like that.

[<a id="00-29-48">00:29:48</a>]  - It's annoying people,

[<a id="00-29-49">00:29:49</a>]  'cause they're all the psychos of the world.

[<a id="00-29-51">00:29:51</a>]  So spying, United Nations.

[<a id="00-29-55">00:29:55</a>]  - Yeah, 'cause Geneva Conventions there, obviously.

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  - And then all the NGOs have their headquarters there as well.

[<a id="00-30-01">00:30:01</a>]  - Yeah, interesting.

[<a id="00-30-02">00:30:02</a>]  - And those are, you know,

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  NGOs are just money laundering operations.

[<a id="00-30-06">00:30:06</a>]  - And I also know that, for whatever reason,

[<a id="00-30-09">00:30:09</a>]  they have the most billionaires live in Switzerland there.

[<a id="00-30-11">00:30:11</a>]  I mean, of course you have them here in Zurich, too,

[<a id="00-30-13">00:30:13</a>]  but I thought it was interesting.

[<a id="00-30-15">00:30:15</a>]  It was more constant in Geneva.

[<a id="00-30-17">00:30:17</a>]  - And there's a funny one in Zug, which is like--

[<a id="00-30-20">00:30:20</a>]  - How do you spell that?

[<a id="00-30-22">00:30:22</a>]  - Z-U-G, which in German also means train,

[<a id="00-30-26">00:30:26</a>]  but it's like, it's 20 minutes by train to Zug.

[<a id="00-30-29">00:30:29</a>]  It's Z-U-G.

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  And these place, this place--

[<a id="00-30-34">00:30:34</a>]  - What are they famous for, that town?

[<a id="00-30-36">00:30:36</a>]  - Tax breaks.

[<a id="00-30-40">00:30:40</a>]  So they have tons of Russian oligarchs in Zug.

[<a id="00-30-44">00:30:44</a>]  - Really?

[<a id="00-30-45">00:30:45</a>]  - If you go to the lake of Zug,

[<a id="00-30-47">00:30:47</a>]  probably even at this time of year,

[<a id="00-30-50">00:30:50</a>]  what's crazy is Swiss, most of the women in Zurich

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  are this amalgam of Swiss, Italian,

[<a id="00-30-58">00:30:58</a>]  some Eastern Europeans, they look a certain way.

[<a id="00-31-01">00:31:01</a>]  In Zug, you get these really tall women

[<a id="00-31-04">00:31:04</a>]  wearing fur coats and high heels.

[<a id="00-31-07">00:31:07</a>]  - Are they skinny, too?

[<a id="00-31-09">00:31:09</a>]  - They're Russian.

[<a id="00-31-10">00:31:10</a>]  - Ah.

[<a id="00-31-11">00:31:11</a>]  - There's a lot of Russians in Zug.

[<a id="00-31-13">00:31:13</a>]  - I never heard of this place.

[<a id="00-31-17">00:31:17</a>]  - Z-U-G, it's 20 minutes from here.

[<a id="00-31-21">00:31:21</a>]  It's also becoming a cryptocurrency valley of Switzerland.

[<a id="00-31-26">00:31:26</a>]  They have things like the Cardano Foundation

[<a id="00-31-31">00:31:31</a>]  have their headquarters in Zug.

[<a id="00-31-32">00:31:32</a>]  - That coin's very popular in Japan.

[<a id="00-31-34">00:31:34</a>]  - It's, my children's future is in that coin, so.

[<a id="00-31-39">00:31:39</a>]  But, yeah, so there's two, what else you got?

[<a id="00-31-46">00:31:46</a>]  Sengen, I don't know what, Sengen--

[<a id="00-31-49">00:31:49</a>]  - Is there like a education of capital of Switzerland,

[<a id="00-31-52">00:31:52</a>]  which particular city, or is it Zurich?

[<a id="00-31-55">00:31:55</a>]  - Good question.

[<a id="00-31-59">00:31:59</a>]  Well, there's two, the two big universities are the ETH,

[<a id="00-32-02">00:32:02</a>]  the Eidgenossiotechnische Hochschule,

[<a id="00-32-07">00:32:07</a>]  but it's the, it's basically that one,

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  and then in Lausanne, the EPFL.

[<a id="00-32-13">00:32:13</a>]  I've got one about Lausanne for you.

[<a id="00-32-15">00:32:15</a>]  Those are the two biggest universities in computer science.

[<a id="00-32-19">00:32:19</a>]  A lot of the breakthroughs in AI happened in Switzerland.

[<a id="00-32-23">00:32:23</a>]  There's actually one guy, he's one of the founders of AI,

[<a id="00-32-26">00:32:26</a>]  or fathers of AI, who lives in Ticino, in southern Switzerland.

[<a id="00-32-30">00:32:30</a>]  But Lausanne is another interesting one,

[<a id="00-32-33">00:32:33</a>]  because Nestle, there's a lot of place

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  where companies have their legal headquarters.

[<a id="00-32-40">00:32:40</a>]  - Why is that?

[<a id="00-32-41">00:32:41</a>]  - Again, I think, again, tax evasion and various,

[<a id="00-32-45">00:32:45</a>]  various things that, maybe it's legal protection.

[<a id="00-32-49">00:32:49</a>]  - I see.

[<a id="00-32-50">00:32:50</a>]  - Yeah, they're harder to sue out of existence.

[<a id="00-32-52">00:32:52</a>]  So you've got Nestle, have their headquarters.

[<a id="00-32-55">00:32:55</a>]  - That's the jackal effect.

[<a id="00-32-57">00:32:57</a>]  - Jackal effect.

[<a id="00-32-57">00:32:57</a>]  No, Nestle, they're the ones trying to charge people

[<a id="00-33-02">00:33:02</a>]  for water, and coming up with shit like air shouldn't,

[<a id="00-33-06">00:33:06</a>]  clean air shouldn't be free.

[<a id="00-33-07">00:33:07</a>]  - I see.

[<a id="00-33-08">00:33:08</a>]  - And, I mean, they're--

[<a id="00-33-11">00:33:11</a>]  - They're clearly sponsored doubles then.

[<a id="00-33-13">00:33:13</a>]  They're a world economic forum.

[<a id="00-33-15">00:33:15</a>]  - Yeah, Nestle is a evil company,

[<a id="00-33-18">00:33:18</a>]  but they make all kinds of shit.

[<a id="00-33-20">00:33:20</a>]  Like ice tea, I don't think, they're a food company.

[<a id="00-33-25">00:33:25</a>]  Like most cornflake companies are owned by Nestle ultimately.

[<a id="00-33-30">00:33:30</a>]  - I really like when people do that.

[<a id="00-33-32">00:33:32</a>]  Like when they say, like this city,

[<a id="00-33-33">00:33:33</a>]  particularly specializing in this, you know?

[<a id="00-33-36">00:33:36</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-33-37">00:33:37</a>]  - Like Houston, it's oil and hospitals.

[<a id="00-33-39">00:33:39</a>]  - Lausanne is where, if you go there,

[<a id="00-33-41">00:33:41</a>]  we could get you down for that comedy club,

[<a id="00-33-44">00:33:44</a>]  maybe before you, like in January.

[<a id="00-33-48">00:33:48</a>]  - Lausanne is weird because,

[<a id="00-33-49">00:33:49</a>]  I keep thinking that was a ski resort, honestly, you know?

[<a id="00-33-54">00:33:54</a>]  I was wrong.

[<a id="00-33-56">00:33:56</a>]  - No, so one of my things is,

[<a id="00-33-59">00:33:59</a>]  I know that sounds bullshit, but high empathy.

[<a id="00-34-03">00:34:03</a>]  So when I was young, I--

[<a id="00-34-05">00:34:05</a>]  - What's that?

[<a id="00-34-06">00:34:06</a>]  - Well, it's that I'm very--

[<a id="00-34-07">00:34:07</a>]  - I'm being sarcastic.

[<a id="00-34-09">00:34:09</a>]  - Yeah, it should be.

[<a id="00-34-10">00:34:10</a>]  But the thing is that I was always somehow very able to,

[<a id="00-34-18">00:34:18</a>]  get a sense of what's going on with people.

[<a id="00-34-20">00:34:20</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-34-21">00:34:21</a>]  - Like for women that do this all the time,

[<a id="00-34-24">00:34:24</a>]  but you know, but for me as a dude,

[<a id="00-34-26">00:34:26</a>]  you're not really supposed to be able to do this.

[<a id="00-34-28">00:34:28</a>]  And when I was a teenager in early 20s,

[<a id="00-34-30">00:34:30</a>]  I used to really be panicked around people

[<a id="00-34-33">00:34:33</a>]  'cause it just freaked me out

[<a id="00-34-35">00:34:35</a>]  'cause I could kind of get a vibe of what they're doing.

[<a id="00-34-38">00:34:38</a>]  And then that kind of switched off and whatever.

[<a id="00-34-42">00:34:42</a>]  So a lot of, I got into being a nerd,

[<a id="00-34-44">00:34:44</a>]  but just to avoid people.

[<a id="00-34-47">00:34:47</a>]  Now I did comedy and it's been like data science

[<a id="00-34-50">00:34:50</a>]  on people for me.

[<a id="00-34-52">00:34:52</a>]  So you see all these patterns.

[<a id="00-34-54">00:34:54</a>]  Anyway, the point is, is when I go to Lausanne,

[<a id="00-34-56">00:34:56</a>]  Zurich, everyone's stressed.

[<a id="00-34-59">00:34:59</a>]  Like that's the general vibe.

[<a id="00-35-01">00:35:01</a>]  Lausanne, there's, you look at the people,

[<a id="00-35-04">00:35:04</a>]  everyone's on the surface happy, having their nice life.

[<a id="00-35-09">00:35:09</a>]  But there is a, you can feel an underlying sense

[<a id="00-35-15">00:35:15</a>]  of some misery in Lausanne.

[<a id="00-35-18">00:35:18</a>]  I do a joke where I go,

[<a id="00-35-19">00:35:19</a>]  you guys legalized marijuana recently,

[<a id="00-35-24">00:35:24</a>]  they're doing it city by city.

[<a id="00-35-26">00:35:26</a>]  - Is that true?

[<a id="00-35-27">00:35:27</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, as well as a trial, decriminalized.

[<a id="00-35-30">00:35:30</a>]  So Zurich's done it, I think, burn Lausanne.

[<a id="00-35-34">00:35:34</a>]  - And prostitution is legally legal

[<a id="00-35-36">00:35:36</a>]  as long as it's not pinked out and brothels.

[<a id="00-35-40">00:35:40</a>]  - I'm not sure what all the,

[<a id="00-35-44">00:35:44</a>]  yeah, it is, whether it's actually legal

[<a id="00-35-47">00:35:47</a>]  or decriminalized, there's certainly,

[<a id="00-35-51">00:35:51</a>]  it's like one of these things where it's very--

[<a id="00-35-53">00:35:53</a>]  - Murky?

[<a id="00-35-54">00:35:54</a>]  - Well, not murky.

[<a id="00-35-55">00:35:55</a>]  It's just like, if you don't call,

[<a id="00-35-58">00:35:58</a>]  you can't open the whole house of Zurich,

[<a id="00-36-01">00:36:01</a>]  the police are gonna show up.

[<a id="00-36-02">00:36:02</a>]  But if you open the contact bar of Zurich,

[<a id="00-36-07">00:36:07</a>]  then you're gonna be fined.

[<a id="00-36-11">00:36:11</a>]  - You don't wanna make it too obvious.

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  You have to be respectful.

[<a id="00-36-14">00:36:14</a>]  - Yeah, and then the police, it's gonna be fine.

[<a id="00-36-17">00:36:17</a>]  And I mean, it's one of the things it's like,

[<a id="00-36-22">00:36:22</a>]  I think the way the Swiss look at it

[<a id="00-36-23">00:36:23</a>]  is 'cause they have bankers here and cocaine,

[<a id="00-36-26">00:36:26</a>]  you gotta have prostitutes,

[<a id="00-36-28">00:36:28</a>]  otherwise the bankers are gonna do so much.

[<a id="00-36-31">00:36:31</a>]  - You're right, it made me laugh

[<a id="00-36-32">00:36:32</a>]  because where was I recently?

[<a id="00-36-34">00:36:34</a>]  Well, when you go Frankfurt,

[<a id="00-36-39">00:36:39</a>]  which is like a financial center for Germany,

[<a id="00-36-41">00:36:41</a>]  they have a huge red light district right by the banks.

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  And I was, where was I recently?

[<a id="00-36-49">00:36:49</a>]  - Hamburg?

[<a id="00-36-50">00:36:50</a>]  - No, I was in Amsterdam too.

[<a id="00-36-52">00:36:52</a>]  And then in the area where there was a lot of banks,

[<a id="00-36-54">00:36:54</a>]  I noticed like it looked very close to red light district.

[<a id="00-36-56">00:36:56</a>]  And also--

[<a id="00-36-57">00:36:57</a>]  - Yeah, the Germans like to put their red light district

[<a id="00-37-01">00:37:01</a>]  around the station.

[<a id="00-37-02">00:37:02</a>]  So yeah, you arrive by train in a city

[<a id="00-37-04">00:37:04</a>]  and the first thing is red light district.

[<a id="00-37-07">00:37:07</a>]  Frankfurt and Munich is like that too.

[<a id="00-37-10">00:37:10</a>]  - Yeah, and well, I mean, Amsterdam is not that far

[<a id="00-37-13">00:37:13</a>]  from red light district from central station, yeah.

[<a id="00-37-16">00:37:16</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, I think they were more pragmatic, I suppose.

[<a id="00-37-21">00:37:21</a>]  We're starting to fry out here, aren't we?

[<a id="00-37-28">00:37:28</a>]  - Well, how much time is that?

[<a id="00-37-29">00:37:29</a>]  - We've done 36 minutes.

[<a id="00-37-31">00:37:31</a>]  - Yeah, it's amazing how much like I lost energy

[<a id="00-37-35">00:37:35</a>]  'cause I--

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  - You peed too soon.

[<a id="00-37-39">00:37:39</a>]  - Well, I mean, I'm still that time difference

[<a id="00-37-41">00:37:41</a>]  'cause yesterday, my French show was 8 p.m.

[<a id="00-37-44">00:37:44</a>]  and I think it was like 2.30, three.

[<a id="00-37-47">00:37:47</a>]  I said, oh, I'll take a 40 minute nap.

[<a id="00-37-49">00:37:49</a>]  I woke up at 8.30 p.m., you know?

[<a id="00-37-53">00:37:53</a>]  (laughs)

[<a id="00-37-55">00:37:55</a>]  Of course, I was up all night

[<a id="00-37-56">00:37:56</a>]  and I was watching "Toy Story 1"

[<a id="00-37-59">00:37:59</a>]  and hopefully finish two and three tonight, but--

[<a id="00-38-02">00:38:02</a>]  - You know what I was thinking, 'cause it's so,

[<a id="00-38-05">00:38:05</a>]  is what was coming out on the podcast we did earlier,

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  I just, it occurred to me that,

[<a id="00-38-11">00:38:11</a>]  'cause you're always traveling, you're always jet-lagged

[<a id="00-38-14">00:38:14</a>]  and staying with Christian for a bit,

[<a id="00-38-16">00:38:16</a>]  it may be one of the first times you slow down

[<a id="00-38-19">00:38:19</a>]  and it could be that you--

[<a id="00-38-20">00:38:20</a>]  - I mean, that's what happened,

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  like prior to going to Japan four weeks ago,

[<a id="00-38-24">00:38:24</a>]  I mean, I was literally flying every other day doing shows

[<a id="00-38-28">00:38:28</a>]  and then working for Russell Peters and doing shows here

[<a id="00-38-30">00:38:30</a>]  or things like that, then I had a two week break

[<a id="00-38-33">00:38:33</a>]  and when I come back, literally I was flying every day

[<a id="00-38-37">00:38:37</a>]  because I had shit to do and when I finished the last show,

[<a id="00-38-40">00:38:40</a>]  which was a week ago today in Christian City, California,

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  I was traveling to one other place

[<a id="00-38-52">00:38:52</a>]  and then when I landed, when I left L.A. on Monday,

[<a id="00-38-56">00:38:56</a>]  you know, I was traveling every day.

[<a id="00-38-58">00:38:58</a>]  I landed on Tuesday in Amsterdam,

[<a id="00-38-59">00:38:59</a>]  Wednesday I went to London,

[<a id="00-39-01">00:39:01</a>]  Thursday I'm back in Brussels,

[<a id="00-39-05">00:39:05</a>]  then I have to take a train and bus back to Amsterdam

[<a id="00-39-08">00:39:08</a>]  and pick up my shit and then I took a 13 hour train

[<a id="00-39-13">00:39:13</a>]  to be here Friday morning and then we did podcast Friday,

[<a id="00-39-16">00:39:16</a>]  Saturday, today's already Sunday.

[<a id="00-39-18">00:39:18</a>]  I mean, honestly, it feels like I've been here a week

[<a id="00-39-22">00:39:22</a>]  but I've only been here only over two days, really,

[<a id="00-39-26">00:39:26</a>]  at this point.

[<a id="00-39-27">00:39:27</a>]  - It got me thinking when you spoke, I felt a bit sorry

[<a id="00-39-31">00:39:31</a>]  for Christian because I realized the more you get rest here,

[<a id="00-39-36">00:39:36</a>]  you're probably gonna become really annoying for Christian.

[<a id="00-39-39">00:39:39</a>]  I mean, you warned him, you said I'm like the vampire

[<a id="00-39-44">00:39:44</a>]  you're invited in, which is fantastic.

[<a id="00-39-49">00:39:49</a>]  - That's what I'm trying to be mindful, you know?

[<a id="00-39-51">00:39:51</a>]  - No, it's cool.

[<a id="00-39-52">00:39:52</a>]  - And, but he's not a complainer.

[<a id="00-39-55">00:39:55</a>]  And, I mean, he's a, we used to do this podcast with him.

[<a id="00-40-00">00:40:00</a>]  One of the most interesting things about Christian

[<a id="00-40-03">00:40:03</a>]  is he's had to rebuild his entire personality

[<a id="00-40-08">00:40:08</a>]  multiple times.

[<a id="00-40-09">00:40:09</a>]  - Wow, what does that mean?

[<a id="00-40-10">00:40:10</a>]  - 'Cause he grew up in a kind of a Christian cult

[<a id="00-40-15">00:40:15</a>]  in Switzerland, like low key, but his family, whatever.

[<a id="00-40-20">00:40:20</a>]  - I mean, he's 100% Swiss, right?

[<a id="00-40-21">00:40:21</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-40-22">00:40:22</a>]  And then at some point he decided this whole religion thing

[<a id="00-40-26">00:40:26</a>]  is bullshit, but he'd been so much in this culture

[<a id="00-40-30">00:40:30</a>]  that everything he'd been told up to the age of 24

[<a id="00-40-34">00:40:34</a>]  and how he should view the world was defined by religion.

[<a id="00-40-39">00:40:39</a>]  And then he just said, this is all bullshit.

[<a id="00-40-41">00:40:41</a>]  And so he had to, and he was working in banking,

[<a id="00-40-43">00:40:43</a>]  he had to like reconstruct his moral framework

[<a id="00-40-47">00:40:47</a>]  and how he judges the world and all this kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-40-51">00:40:51</a>]  And then to me, that's fascinating,

[<a id="00-40-52">00:40:52</a>]  'cause like for me, my general opinions on people,

[<a id="00-40-56">00:40:56</a>]  life, civilization have, there's some,

[<a id="00-40-59">00:40:59</a>]  it's an evolution, but there's a continuity

[<a id="00-41-03">00:41:03</a>]  versus like having to go, wait,

[<a id="00-41-05">00:41:05</a>]  everything that I had to this point was bullshit.

[<a id="00-41-08">00:41:08</a>]  Now I've got to make, and then same with marriage

[<a id="00-41-11">00:41:11</a>]  and other stuff he's done in his life.

[<a id="00-41-14">00:41:14</a>]  - Believe me, if you and Christian spend a lot of time

[<a id="00-41-16">00:41:16</a>]  with me, I'm inconsistent, maybe even lying

[<a id="00-41-19">00:41:19</a>]  or not remembering things and stuff like that,

[<a id="00-41-21">00:41:21</a>]  as people are complicated, you know, but

[<a id="00-41-25">00:41:25</a>]  I think you lose your mind

[<a id="00-41-29">00:41:29</a>]  because sometimes you're doing two contradictory thing

[<a id="00-41-32">00:41:32</a>]  you can reconcile and you have a mental breakdown.

[<a id="00-41-35">00:41:35</a>]  I have a friend that is so anti-Jews

[<a id="00-41-37">00:41:37</a>]  and like anti-Zionism stuff, but what makes me laugh,

[<a id="00-41-40">00:41:40</a>]  he was working for one of the biggest Jews in LA.

[<a id="00-41-44">00:41:44</a>]  If you go to their office, there's all this picture

[<a id="00-41-46">00:41:46</a>]  of his bosses with like Prime Minister Israel, you know,

[<a id="00-41-49">00:41:49</a>]  like, so that's fine.

[<a id="00-41-50">00:41:50</a>]  How do you reconcile like they're killing

[<a id="00-41-52">00:41:52</a>]  all those Palestinian kids, whatever.

[<a id="00-41-54">00:41:54</a>]  Of course it's terrible when any kids are getting killed,

[<a id="00-41-56">00:41:56</a>]  but like, but you used to work one of the most powerful

[<a id="00-41-59">00:41:59</a>]  Zionists, you know, like how do you reconcile like

[<a id="00-42-02">00:42:02</a>]  you need a job, they give you opportunity to work

[<a id="00-42-05">00:42:05</a>]  and you made money and you hate Jews,

[<a id="00-42-08">00:42:08</a>]  but they provided you a livelihood, you know, so like.

[<a id="00-42-12">00:42:12</a>]  - Actually, what is it about Jews where they,

[<a id="00-42-16">00:42:16</a>]  this is, that's already a terrible,

[<a id="00-42-17">00:42:17</a>]  what is it about Jews that they actually like,

[<a id="00-42-20">00:42:20</a>]  do they like people to work for them that hate them?

[<a id="00-42-24">00:42:24</a>]  Do you think that gets a better employee?

[<a id="00-42-26">00:42:26</a>]  Like if--

[<a id="00-42-27">00:42:27</a>]  - Well, that's redundant, isn't it?

[<a id="00-42-28">00:42:28</a>]  'Cause I think everyone hates their bosses, don't they?

[<a id="00-42-31">00:42:31</a>]  I don't think most people like Jobs.

[<a id="00-42-34">00:42:34</a>]  - No, he was a--

[<a id="00-42-34">00:42:34</a>]  - Most people don't have meaningful work, you know?

[<a id="00-42-36">00:42:36</a>]  - Oh, Jobs in general, yeah, I think it was Steve Jobs.

[<a id="00-42-39">00:42:39</a>]  Steve Jobs was it.

[<a id="00-42-40">00:42:40</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-42-42">00:42:42</a>]  - Wasn't he a Syrian?

[<a id="00-42-44">00:42:44</a>]  He's Syrian, he was going to a restaurant

[<a id="00-42-47">00:42:47</a>]  in Silicon Valley run by a guy who happened to be his dad.

[<a id="00-42-50">00:42:50</a>]  There was a period, both of them didn't know.

[<a id="00-42-52">00:42:52</a>]  And eventually he found out that was his father,

[<a id="00-42-54">00:42:54</a>]  so he was hanging out.

[<a id="00-42-55">00:42:55</a>]  And the guy never knew that was his son.

[<a id="00-42-58">00:42:58</a>]  In fact, supposedly, I don't know if it's true,

[<a id="00-43-00">00:43:00</a>]  but he was having conversations like,

[<a id="00-43-01">00:43:01</a>]  yeah, we used to have famous people come here.

[<a id="00-43-03">00:43:03</a>]  I even heard Steve Jobs, you know,

[<a id="00-43-05">00:43:05</a>]  he didn't even realize he was talking to Steve Jobs,

[<a id="00-43-07">00:43:07</a>]  who happened to be his son.

[<a id="00-43-09">00:43:09</a>]  Yeah, that's a weird one.

[<a id="00-43-11">00:43:11</a>]  And also I thought

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  Jeff Bezos liked Latin women because he was Cuban.

[<a id="00-43-20">00:43:20</a>]  I found out later on, he's Danish.

[<a id="00-43-23">00:43:23</a>]  That his parents-- - What?

[<a id="00-43-24">00:43:24</a>]  - His father's Danish and a clown.

[<a id="00-43-27">00:43:27</a>]  I'm not joking, his dad is like a clown,

[<a id="00-43-29">00:43:29</a>]  living in the States, got his mom pregnant.

[<a id="00-43-32">00:43:32</a>]  When she gave birth to their son,

[<a id="00-43-34">00:43:34</a>]  look, I'll take care of him,

[<a id="00-43-36">00:43:36</a>]  just give me all the parental rights,

[<a id="00-43-38">00:43:38</a>]  you have nothing to do with him.

[<a id="00-43-39">00:43:39</a>]  And this Danish clown later on found out

[<a id="00-43-42">00:43:42</a>]  that his son happened to be the richest man

[<a id="00-43-45">00:43:45</a>]  in the whole planet, but they never really connected.

[<a id="00-43-47">00:43:47</a>]  And Bezos' mom married a Cuban guy

[<a id="00-43-52">00:43:52</a>]  who became like his father, who is his father.

[<a id="00-43-55">00:43:55</a>]  So for a long time, I thought, wow, Bezos is like Cuban.

[<a id="00-43-58">00:43:58</a>]  And it just brought my faith back

[<a id="00-44-00">00:44:00</a>]  that white European with a lot of high culture

[<a id="00-44-04">00:44:04</a>]  is the one producing people like that, you know?

[<a id="00-44-09">00:44:09</a>]  - I think, I mean--

[<a id="00-44-11">00:44:11</a>]  - I'm not saying it can't happen anywhere else,

[<a id="00-44-14">00:44:14</a>]  which is interesting where if you look

[<a id="00-44-16">00:44:16</a>]  at vast majority of the US presidents,

[<a id="00-44-19">00:44:19</a>]  that they are mostly from Northern European descent.

[<a id="00-44-22">00:44:22</a>]  - I think it's true, but my theory, for me--

[<a id="00-44-27">00:44:27</a>]  - Culture matters, man, I'm telling you.

[<a id="00-44-30">00:44:30</a>]  - I think it's 'cause we have the most effective system

[<a id="00-44-35">00:44:35</a>]  for traumatizing people, because--

[<a id="00-44-39">00:44:39</a>]  - That might be true, but that trauma also brought

[<a id="00-44-41">00:44:41</a>]  a lot of creative people, talented people.

[<a id="00-44-43">00:44:43</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, I do a bit about this with my kids.

[<a id="00-44-46">00:44:46</a>]  My kids are becoming healthy people,

[<a id="00-44-48">00:44:48</a>]  I've done a good job as a dad,

[<a id="00-44-50">00:44:50</a>]  which means I'll never accomplish anything.

[<a id="00-44-52">00:44:52</a>]  And then, I mean, the example of using the joke is Mozart.

[<a id="00-44-57">00:44:57</a>]  It's true, they're gonna be--

[<a id="00-44-59">00:44:59</a>]  - Go ahead, what do you wanna say about Mozart?

[<a id="00-45-01">00:45:01</a>]  - 'Cause if you dig into this, Mozart's dad was fucking,

[<a id="00-45-06">00:45:06</a>]  he was probably fucking Mozart.

[<a id="00-45-08">00:45:08</a>]  Like, I wouldn't be surprised,

[<a id="00-45-10">00:45:10</a>]  but he was bullying his son to play.

[<a id="00-45-12">00:45:12</a>]  - People go like, "Oh, he was just born a pro."

[<a id="00-45-14">00:45:14</a>]  No, he fucking wasn't.

[<a id="00-45-15">00:45:15</a>]  His dad was beating the shit out of him

[<a id="00-45-18">00:45:18</a>]  to make him play the piano.

[<a id="00-45-19">00:45:19</a>]  - I don't know if it's true, but you know what popped

[<a id="00-45-21">00:45:21</a>]  in my head was the Macaulay Culkin, the siblings,

[<a id="00-45-25">00:45:25</a>]  they're all talented actors.

[<a id="00-45-26">00:45:26</a>]  I heard their dad was a motherfucker, man.

[<a id="00-45-28">00:45:28</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="00-45-29">00:45:29</a>]  - And also, what's his name, Shia LaBeouf?

[<a id="00-45-32">00:45:32</a>]  I'm sure he loved his dad,

[<a id="00-45-33">00:45:33</a>]  but he sounded like a bit of a prick himself,

[<a id="00-45-36">00:45:36</a>]  or a difficult guy.

[<a id="00-45-38">00:45:38</a>]  - Because I think--

[<a id="00-45-38">00:45:38</a>]  - They didn't have a talent, but they're fortunate

[<a id="00-45-40">00:45:40</a>]  that they're talented kids do stuff that they can do.

[<a id="00-45-42">00:45:42</a>]  - It's like, if you look at a human being as like a pond,

[<a id="00-45-46">00:45:46</a>]  a pond that doesn't have stones thrown in it

[<a id="00-45-49">00:45:49</a>]  is nice and smooth.

[<a id="00-45-51">00:45:51</a>]  And so, a lot of this traumatizing, it creates these,

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  and basically, you're creating an adult

[<a id="00-45-57">00:45:57</a>]  who's never able to find peace

[<a id="00-45-59">00:45:59</a>]  'cause they've got all this shit you put in their head.

[<a id="00-46-01">00:46:01</a>]  It takes them a lifetime to calm the fuck down again.

[<a id="00-46-05">00:46:05</a>]  And out of that, we get all this great entertainment.

[<a id="00-46-08">00:46:08</a>]  - I will hand it, one of my former person I hang out,

[<a id="00-46-13">00:46:13</a>]  that his mother was such a narcissist,

[<a id="00-46-17">00:46:17</a>]  then do a really good job of providing

[<a id="00-46-21">00:46:21</a>]  happy, loving relationship,

[<a id="00-46-24">00:46:24</a>]  that this person was so narcissistic

[<a id="00-46-28">00:46:28</a>]  that have to accomplish so much in the world

[<a id="00-46-32">00:46:32</a>]  so they get validation, you know?

[<a id="00-46-34">00:46:34</a>]  - Exactly, yeah.

[<a id="00-46-35">00:46:35</a>]  - I guess if you want your son to be successful,

[<a id="00-46-38">00:46:38</a>]  I guess you made it happen.

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  But this is so unhealthy, you know?

[<a id="00-46-44">00:46:44</a>]  - To me, my philosophy of parenting

[<a id="00-46-47">00:46:47</a>]  is that I want them to--

[<a id="00-46-51">00:46:51</a>]  - Nobody's asking for it.

[<a id="00-46-53">00:46:53</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-46-54">00:46:54</a>]  - I'm kidding.

[<a id="00-46-55">00:46:55</a>]  - True.

[<a id="00-46-56">00:46:56</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-46-57">00:46:57</a>]  I wanted to spread a message of love to the world.

[<a id="00-47-00">00:47:00</a>]  But no, I mean, simply, I just want them to do whatever

[<a id="00-47-05">00:47:05</a>]  to be doing something that they're happy doing.

[<a id="00-47-09">00:47:09</a>]  - Yeah, do something.

[<a id="00-47-10">00:47:10</a>]  - And I don't tell them, oh, you're amazing.

[<a id="00-47-13">00:47:13</a>]  I never tell them that.

[<a id="00-47-14">00:47:14</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-47-15">00:47:15</a>]  - But I also don't beat them up and fucking traumatize them.

[<a id="00-47-18">00:47:18</a>]  - It is crazy looking back,

[<a id="00-47-21">00:47:21</a>]  'cause I think you guys, I think we recorded, what?

[<a id="00-47-26">00:47:26</a>]  Six or seven hours of podcasting.

[<a id="00-47-28">00:47:28</a>]  Believe me, more than half of it is shit.

[<a id="00-47-31">00:47:31</a>]  Because you're having a conversation, right?

[<a id="00-47-33">00:47:33</a>]  This is true of life.

[<a id="00-47-34">00:47:34</a>]  But there's a couple moments I thought,

[<a id="00-47-36">00:47:36</a>]  oh, that was kind of actually kind of fun thing to say.

[<a id="00-47-38">00:47:38</a>]  You guys were laughing or that was kind of interesting.

[<a id="00-47-41">00:47:41</a>]  You know, I lost my train of thought.

[<a id="00-47-45">00:47:45</a>]  - But, I mean, to the European that make the best leaders

[<a id="00-47-49">00:47:49</a>]  is 'cause our system of traumatizing people

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  is primitive and violent.

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  Like what you're saying about what to me is very interesting,

[<a id="00-48-02">00:48:02</a>]  Asian parents never tell the truth.

[<a id="00-48-04">00:48:04</a>]  - Oh, that's what I was trying to say.

[<a id="00-48-06">00:48:06</a>]  I didn't grow up with like parents.

[<a id="00-48-09">00:48:09</a>]  - You didn't grow up with parents?

[<a id="00-48-11">00:48:11</a>]  - I didn't grow up with parents trying to instill

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  certain values and working hard and be successful.

[<a id="00-48-18">00:48:18</a>]  I never had anyone like that.

[<a id="00-48-20">00:48:20</a>]  I'm surprised that given my situation,

[<a id="00-48-25">00:48:25</a>]  if I grew up in Japan,

[<a id="00-48-26">00:48:26</a>]  I'm pretty sure I would have been criminal in Japan.

[<a id="00-48-28">00:48:28</a>]  My mother was one of those people like,

[<a id="00-48-32">00:48:32</a>]  why do you have all these fucking books?

[<a id="00-48-34">00:48:34</a>]  Why are you wasting your time reading books?

[<a id="00-48-36">00:48:36</a>]  Can you imagine Asian mothers saying that?

[<a id="00-48-38">00:48:38</a>]  But that's the kind of shit she was saying.

[<a id="00-48-40">00:48:40</a>]  - Do you have tattoos by the way?

[<a id="00-48-42">00:48:42</a>]  - No, no, no, I wouldn't do that.

[<a id="00-48-43">00:48:43</a>]  I'm too pussy, I'm a pussy.

[<a id="00-48-46">00:48:46</a>]  - That's something we got in common.

[<a id="00-48-49">00:48:49</a>]  Yeah, anyway.

[<a id="00-48-49">00:48:49</a>]  - My dad, he wasn't really part of my life.

[<a id="00-48-55">00:48:55</a>]  I mean, he was alive and he was a 6,000 miles away,

[<a id="00-48-57">00:48:57</a>]  but yeah, I didn't grow up with like

[<a id="00-48-59">00:48:59</a>]  stereotypical Asian parents there to like prepare for life.

[<a id="00-49-06">00:49:06</a>]  They did none of those things, none whatsoever.

[<a id="00-49-10">00:49:10</a>]  - Do you think you're happier as a consequence

[<a id="00-49-14">00:49:14</a>]  despite all the other stuff?

[<a id="00-49-16">00:49:16</a>]  Like if you, if they-

[<a id="00-49-17">00:49:17</a>]  - I don't want to say that my life is all misery,

[<a id="00-49-19">00:49:19</a>]  but what's problem with me a lot of time is I look back,

[<a id="00-49-22">00:49:22</a>]  oh, I guess I was happy back then,

[<a id="00-49-24">00:49:24</a>]  but I didn't realize at the time.

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  That's weirdly weird, you know?

[<a id="00-49-27">00:49:27</a>]  Like I wish I would have known I was happy at the time.

[<a id="00-49-30">00:49:30</a>]  I just had no idea.

[<a id="00-49-31">00:49:31</a>]  Yeah, I know what you mean.

[<a id="00-49-34">00:49:34</a>]  I guess I got to keep doing this shitty job,

[<a id="00-49-38">00:49:38</a>]  but it was actually kind of good in a way,

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  but I didn't appreciate it at the time.

[<a id="00-49-44">00:49:44</a>]  Yeah, and I don't think I'll, I'll always be off.

[<a id="00-49-48">00:49:48</a>]  But I think that sometimes that's the funny part

[<a id="00-49-51">00:49:51</a>]  on stage too, you know?

[<a id="00-49-52">00:49:52</a>]  'Cause, but I mean, I mean, if I look at,

[<a id="00-49-55">00:49:55</a>]  if I look at people I've met and know,

[<a id="00-49-57">00:49:57</a>]  I mean, one of you were talking about with two old dudes.

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  The one issue I got is a lot of people,

[<a id="00-50-02">00:50:02</a>]  a lot of dudes my age are boring as fuck.

[<a id="00-50-05">00:50:05</a>]  Especially the ones that stayed with a woman

[<a id="00-50-08">00:50:08</a>]  and had kids and did a job.

[<a id="00-50-09">00:50:09</a>]  - I'm definitely boring to women.

[<a id="00-50-11">00:50:11</a>]  - Well, why are you boring to women?

[<a id="00-50-14">00:50:14</a>]  - I am.

[<a id="00-50-15">00:50:15</a>]  I did.

[<a id="00-50-17">00:50:17</a>]  I mean, even if I say some of the interesting stuff

[<a id="00-50-21">00:50:21</a>]  that you guys seem like enjoying,

[<a id="00-50-23">00:50:23</a>]  but like, I don't say that all the time

[<a id="00-50-25">00:50:25</a>]  because a lot of them I got lucky.

[<a id="00-50-27">00:50:27</a>]  Like I just say some throwaway line and it just,

[<a id="00-50-31">00:50:31</a>]  look, even broken clocks are correct twice.

[<a id="00-50-33">00:50:33</a>]  So like if I took seven hours,

[<a id="00-50-35">00:50:35</a>]  maybe I would say five minutes of something useful,

[<a id="00-50-37">00:50:37</a>]  you know, but once those girls get to know me,

[<a id="00-50-41">00:50:41</a>]  like I don't, I don't,

[<a id="00-50-42">00:50:42</a>]  I don't have anything to offer to women at all.

[<a id="00-50-45">00:50:45</a>]  - You may kill it in this city if you stick around

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  because the women here.

[<a id="00-50-49">00:50:49</a>]  - I don't think I could live here now.

[<a id="00-50-51">00:50:51</a>]  - It's a painfully boring place.

[<a id="00-50-53">00:50:53</a>]  - Even better because the women here have money.

[<a id="00-50-55">00:50:55</a>]  So they're not looking for a provider.

[<a id="00-50-57">00:50:57</a>]  - I'm not black though.

[<a id="00-50-58">00:50:58</a>]  - But what they're looking for, it doesn't matter.

[<a id="00-51-01">00:51:01</a>]  It doesn't matter what they're looking for.

[<a id="00-51-03">00:51:03</a>]  - I'm not Puerto Rican.

[<a id="00-51-04">00:51:04</a>]  - Is, is anybody to, cause you say it's so boring,

[<a id="00-51-07">00:51:07</a>]  anybody who can make their life unboring for a little bit.

[<a id="00-51-11">00:51:11</a>]  And, and, and so where you like.

[<a id="00-51-14">00:51:14</a>]  - I understand what you're saying,

[<a id="00-51-16">00:51:16</a>]  but where, what you're basically saying,

[<a id="00-51-18">00:51:18</a>]  like if even if there's a woman that interests us,

[<a id="00-51-20">00:51:20</a>]  like 55 year old, useless man,

[<a id="00-51-24">00:51:24</a>]  that distraction will wear off eventually, you know?

[<a id="00-51-26">00:51:26</a>]  - Oh yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-51-27">00:51:27</a>]  - That's what I'm saying.

[<a id="00-51-28">00:51:28</a>]  - Yeah, that's true.

[<a id="00-51-29">00:51:29</a>]  - It's not gonna last.

[<a id="00-51-30">00:51:30</a>]  - But, but I mean,

[<a id="00-51-32">00:51:32</a>]  I don't think anyone's relationships last anymore.

[<a id="00-51-35">00:51:35</a>]  I think it's been, yeah.

[<a id="00-51-38">00:51:38</a>]  - Traditional people,

[<a id="00-51-41">00:51:41</a>]  and there's some value to tradition, I think.

[<a id="00-51-43">00:51:43</a>]  People who are classy, they know values of good things.

[<a id="00-51-47">00:51:47</a>]  They're willing to pay for it.

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  Poor people don't know the value of good things.

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  That's why they keep buying cheap shit

[<a id="00-51-52">00:51:52</a>]  that keep breaking down.

[<a id="00-51-53">00:51:53</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-51-54">00:51:54</a>]  - Literally, both materially and also abstractly,

[<a id="00-51-57">00:51:57</a>]  like not marrying the right person

[<a id="00-52-00">00:52:00</a>]  or taking marriage as something that is,

[<a id="00-52-03">00:52:03</a>]  is an important institution.

[<a id="00-52-05">00:52:05</a>]  As much as I don't like it,

[<a id="00-52-06">00:52:06</a>]  as much as I think is useless.

[<a id="00-52-08">00:52:08</a>]  - But that's how--

[<a id="00-52-09">00:52:09</a>]  - But if you look at the history of humanity,

[<a id="00-52-11">00:52:11</a>]  it is an important institution.

[<a id="00-52-12">00:52:12</a>]  - It's how you get generational wealth

[<a id="00-52-14">00:52:14</a>]  and all this kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-52-15">00:52:15</a>]  - And maintain civilization, you know?

[<a id="00-52-18">00:52:18</a>]  So I get it.

[<a id="00-52-20">00:52:20</a>]  But I'm 55 years old, you're 51 years old.

[<a id="00-52-24">00:52:24</a>]  You have two kids, so you have some legacy, you know?

[<a id="00-52-26">00:52:26</a>]  And even if I wanna have kids,

[<a id="00-52-29">00:52:29</a>]  I don't wanna go through the pain

[<a id="00-52-30">00:52:30</a>]  of reversing my vasectomy,

[<a id="00-52-32">00:52:32</a>]  'cause I think it's a little too late for that.

[<a id="00-52-34">00:52:34</a>]  But even if I could, I don't wanna, you know,

[<a id="00-52-37">00:52:37</a>]  it was really painful going through that shit.

[<a id="00-52-39">00:52:39</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-52-41">00:52:41</a>]  Honestly, it was not a fun thing, dude.

[<a id="00-52-43">00:52:43</a>]  Honestly, 'cause I did it

[<a id="00-52-46">00:52:46</a>]  'cause I wasn't so sure about having kids

[<a id="00-52-48">00:52:48</a>]  and my boss mentioned that we have to shut down the shop,

[<a id="00-52-53">00:52:53</a>]  things are going bad.

[<a id="00-52-53">00:52:53</a>]  So I was losing my insurance.

[<a id="00-52-56">00:52:56</a>]  And one other thing I noticed with insurance

[<a id="00-52-57">00:52:57</a>]  was it cover 100% of vasectomy.

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  Of course, they pay for the most barbaric

[<a id="00-53-04">00:53:04</a>]  and cheap vasectomy service, you know?

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  I went to the cheapest doctor in town.

[<a id="00-53-10">00:53:10</a>]  At one point when he was doing the surgery,

[<a id="00-53-13">00:53:13</a>]  there's a phone call, oh, excuse me,

[<a id="00-53-14">00:53:14</a>]  he fucking left during the surgery, dude.

[<a id="00-53-17">00:53:17</a>]  I'm just all blotted up.

[<a id="00-53-18">00:53:18</a>]  - Your nut sack is open.

[<a id="00-53-19">00:53:19</a>]  - Yeah, it looked like fucking really, really bad.

[<a id="00-53-22">00:53:22</a>]  What's the people that cook that food for other of you?

[<a id="00-53-27">00:53:27</a>]  Benihana, right?

[<a id="00-53-28">00:53:28</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-53-31">00:53:31</a>]  He didn't even have a fucking nurse, you know?

[<a id="00-53-33">00:53:33</a>]  So I'm just like, what the fuck, you know?

[<a id="00-53-36">00:53:36</a>]  And when he came back, he finished,

[<a id="00-53-37">00:53:37</a>]  he had this flare thing, he's burning inside my nuts.

[<a id="00-53-40">00:53:40</a>]  You see a flame.

[<a id="00-53-41">00:53:41</a>]  These days, when you get vasectomy, I don't know,

[<a id="00-53-43">00:53:43</a>]  it's like a water base where they somehow do a surgical thing

[<a id="00-53-46">00:53:46</a>]  without less invasive and damaging, you know?

[<a id="00-53-49">00:53:49</a>]  But, yeah, so, you know.

[<a id="00-53-52">00:53:52</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-53-56">00:53:56</a>]  I know sometimes people don't like when I say that,

[<a id="00-54-02">00:54:02</a>]  but I think life is meaningless.

[<a id="00-54-05">00:54:05</a>]  Life is meaningless, and they get mad,

[<a id="00-54-10">00:54:10</a>]  but what I'm saying is life is meaningless,

[<a id="00-54-12">00:54:12</a>]  but given the opportunity, you can't give meaning to it.

[<a id="00-54-16">00:54:16</a>]  And some people have kids, so that is their legacy,

[<a id="00-54-19">00:54:19</a>]  but Switzerland's a really interesting place

[<a id="00-54-20">00:54:20</a>]  'cause you have people like--

[<a id="00-54-22">00:54:22</a>]  - Wait, can I ask this one?

[<a id="00-54-24">00:54:24</a>]  I've got a childish question.

[<a id="00-54-27">00:54:27</a>]  After you have vasectomy, no one's ever,

[<a id="00-54-29">00:54:29</a>]  I've tried to ask this, but I've always been too shy.

[<a id="00-54-32">00:54:32</a>]  Does your cum change color?

[<a id="00-54-35">00:54:35</a>]  - It's same.

[<a id="00-54-36">00:54:36</a>]  - So it actually looks the same.

[<a id="00-54-38">00:54:38</a>]  - It's like sugar water, there's no sugar in it.

[<a id="00-54-42">00:54:42</a>]  I mean, I don't know what I'm saying, but it just,

[<a id="00-54-44">00:54:44</a>]  you should, but there's essential part

[<a id="00-54-47">00:54:47</a>]  of getting somebody pregnant, it's gone.

[<a id="00-54-49">00:54:49</a>]  - Actually, so all the fluid and whatever it is,

[<a id="00-54-53">00:54:53</a>]  smell and all, is more like a,

[<a id="00-54-55">00:54:55</a>]  yeah, like a delivery mechanism.

[<a id="00-55-00">00:55:00</a>]  - I guess so.

[<a id="00-55-01">00:55:01</a>]  - So that, so it's like a--

[<a id="00-55-04">00:55:04</a>]  - You already made me forget what I was gonna say,

[<a id="00-55-05">00:55:05</a>]  but go ahead, continue.

[<a id="00-55-07">00:55:07</a>]  - There's something, 'cause I always thought like,

[<a id="00-55-10">00:55:10</a>]  you get a vasectomy and then your cum is just see-through,

[<a id="00-55-14">00:55:14</a>]  there's no color in it anymore.

[<a id="00-55-15">00:55:15</a>]  - It's the same color, but yeah.

[<a id="00-55-18">00:55:18</a>]  - Interesting.

[<a id="00-55-19">00:55:19</a>]  - And he did tell me don't masturbate, don't have sex

[<a id="00-55-22">00:55:22</a>]  for like, I don't know, two, three, four days or something.

[<a id="00-55-24">00:55:24</a>]  I can't remember.

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  - But they'd break through.

[<a id="00-55-28">00:55:28</a>]  - But they did it.

[<a id="00-55-29">00:55:29</a>]  And what was funny is I was getting vasectomy

[<a id="00-55-32">00:55:32</a>]  around the time when the Shining Path,

[<a id="00-55-36">00:55:36</a>]  this Maoist guerrilla invaded Japanese Embassy in Peru.

[<a id="00-55-40">00:55:40</a>]  And I think the day I was getting vasectomy

[<a id="00-55-44">00:55:44</a>]  is when Alberto Fujimori sank his trip underground

[<a id="00-55-48">00:55:48</a>]  and killed all those communists, you know?

[<a id="00-55-50">00:55:50</a>]  That's when I was getting all my dick bloodied up

[<a id="00-55-54">00:55:54</a>]  and put flare and putting everything back.

[<a id="00-55-57">00:55:57</a>]  - You had a shining pair between you and the Shining Path.

[<a id="00-56-02">00:56:02</a>]  There's something there.

[<a id="00-56-03">00:56:03</a>]  - Yeah, I remember David Taylor said like,

[<a id="00-56-05">00:56:05</a>]  I don't know why we had this conversation.

[<a id="00-56-07">00:56:07</a>]  If he asked me, are you gonna have kids?

[<a id="00-56-09">00:56:09</a>]  Like I had a vasectomy, he just said you're selfish.

[<a id="00-56-11">00:56:11</a>]  But what's funny is that Dave is a little older than me

[<a id="00-56-14">00:56:14</a>]  and he doesn't have kids.

[<a id="00-56-15">00:56:15</a>]  So he did the same thing.

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  It's just a couple of friends

[<a id="00-56-19">00:56:19</a>]  when I told him I had a vasectomy.

[<a id="00-56-20">00:56:20</a>]  Why?

[<a id="00-56-21">00:56:21</a>]  Your personality horrible.

[<a id="00-56-24">00:56:24</a>]  It's like you have an abortion as a personality, you know?

[<a id="00-56-27">00:56:27</a>]  Now why would anyone be attracted to you?

[<a id="00-56-29">00:56:29</a>]  And of course it's really, really funny, but.

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  Well, yeah, but there's times I do,

[<a id="00-56-34">00:56:34</a>]  like when I see people with amazing kids,

[<a id="00-56-37">00:56:37</a>]  it does make me regret.

[<a id="00-56-39">00:56:39</a>]  But there's other times they have these fucking monsters

[<a id="00-56-43">00:56:43</a>]  as a kid.

[<a id="00-56-44">00:56:44</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  - Yeah, but honestly I think--

[<a id="00-56-48">00:56:48</a>]  - It is scary.

[<a id="00-56-49">00:56:49</a>]  - I think most of the time monsters are,

[<a id="00-56-51">00:56:51</a>]  it's a reflection of the parents, not the kids.

[<a id="00-56-54">00:56:54</a>]  Is it? - Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-55">00:56:55</a>]  - 'Cause a lot of the shit that parents are told

[<a id="00-57-00">00:57:00</a>]  how to raise kids is completely fucked up.

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  And yeah, like one of the things is,

[<a id="00-57-09">00:57:09</a>]  I started being a single dad, my son was nine,

[<a id="00-57-13">00:57:13</a>]  daughter was 11.

[<a id="00-57-15">00:57:15</a>]  And because I was a--

[<a id="00-57-17">00:57:17</a>]  - But you guys were never married, were you?

[<a id="00-57-20">00:57:20</a>]  - We were never married, but I moved out,

[<a id="00-57-22">00:57:22</a>]  and then I'll edit this out 'cause I don't like talking.

[<a id="00-57-27">00:57:27</a>]  My ex was--

[<a id="00-57-29">00:57:29</a>]  - Oh, you get to edit out your shit.

[<a id="00-57-31">00:57:31</a>]  - Yeah, just for the kids and for,

[<a id="00-57-34">00:57:34</a>]  she was beating up my daughter,

[<a id="00-57-36">00:57:36</a>]  and then I had to fight a soldier, and I won.

[<a id="00-57-38">00:57:38</a>]  - What was your daughter doing?

[<a id="00-57-40">00:57:40</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-57-41">00:57:41</a>]  - She was being me, which it was half me,

[<a id="00-57-44">00:57:44</a>]  and I needed beating apparently.

[<a id="00-57-47">00:57:47</a>]  I mean, I had a 10-year being abused relationship.

[<a id="00-57-51">00:57:51</a>]  Mother of my kids is massively narcissistic.

[<a id="00-57-54">00:57:54</a>]  But there's like--

[<a id="00-57-55">00:57:55</a>]  - But what is it about you that made you attracted to her?

[<a id="00-57-57">00:57:57</a>]  So that's a problem too.

[<a id="00-57-59">00:57:59</a>]  - Yeah, exactly.

[<a id="00-58-00">00:58:00</a>]  I was drawn to the drama

[<a id="00-58-02">00:58:02</a>]  because I had a very stable childhood.

[<a id="00-58-05">00:58:05</a>]  - Yeah, you notice how they're victim blaming?

[<a id="00-58-07">00:58:07</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  - I know.

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  But yeah, no, it's true, that's part of it,

[<a id="00-58-14">00:58:14</a>]  because I was the idiot that allowed that to happen.

[<a id="00-58-17">00:58:17</a>]  - Yeah, because sometimes, I don't wanna be those guys

[<a id="00-58-19">00:58:19</a>]  like these fucking bitches, blah, blah, blah.

[<a id="00-58-21">00:58:21</a>]  I just say it like that,

[<a id="00-58-22">00:58:22</a>]  but I have to say I'm the problem with the phone.

[<a id="00-58-25">00:58:25</a>]  I'm not mathematically speaking.

[<a id="00-58-27">00:58:27</a>]  It takes two people to have a bad marriage,

[<a id="00-58-29">00:58:29</a>]  not one, obviously. - Absolutely, absolutely.

[<a id="00-58-31">00:58:31</a>]  - So I don't wanna be those guys blame women

[<a id="00-58-33">00:58:33</a>]  because there's plenty of good women.

[<a id="00-58-34">00:58:34</a>]  I choose not to be with them.

[<a id="00-58-36">00:58:36</a>]  I choose to be with somebody problematic

[<a id="00-58-38">00:58:38</a>]  'cause if they ended up with me,

[<a id="00-58-40">00:58:40</a>]  they're clearly have problems.

[<a id="00-58-42">00:58:42</a>]  - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-43">00:58:43</a>]  So let's have that awareness.

[<a id="00-58-44">00:58:44</a>]  - I think what it was the attraction for me

[<a id="00-58-47">00:58:47</a>]  is that I grew up in this upper middle class family

[<a id="00-58-50">00:58:50</a>]  and it was always like everything's fine,

[<a id="00-58-54">00:58:54</a>]  we're stable, and there was never shouting, never.

[<a id="00-58-58">00:58:58</a>]  It wasn't exactly loving, but it was safe.

[<a id="00-59-03">00:59:03</a>]  And so the mother of my kids,

[<a id="00-59-08">00:59:08</a>]  within a week of getting to know her,

[<a id="00-59-11">00:59:11</a>]  she's throwing shit at me.

[<a id="00-59-13">00:59:13</a>]  And I remember this voice in my head saying,

[<a id="00-59-15">00:59:15</a>]  "Dude, fucking leave, never come back."

[<a id="00-59-19">00:59:19</a>]  But another part of me was just fascinated.

[<a id="00-59-21">00:59:21</a>]  And then after that, I never--

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  - You don't regret having kids, do you?

[<a id="00-59-26">00:59:26</a>]  Wrong answer.

[<a id="00-59-31">00:59:31</a>]  Wrong hesitation. (laughs)

[<a id="00-59-34">00:59:34</a>]  - This is what I think about a lot.

[<a id="00-59-36">00:59:36</a>]  I love my kids, they're fantastic.

[<a id="00-59-37">00:59:37</a>]  But if somebody handed me a time machine

[<a id="00-59-41">00:59:41</a>]  so I could go back and unmute the mother,

[<a id="00-59-46">00:59:46</a>]  I would sit and stare at that for fucking hours

[<a id="00-59-49">00:59:49</a>]  before I used it or maybe not.

[<a id="00-59-51">00:59:51</a>]  I probably wouldn't 'cause in a selfish sense,

[<a id="00-59-55">00:59:55</a>]  I've got a lot out of being a dad.

[<a id="00-59-57">00:59:57</a>]  It's changed me a lot as a person.

[<a id="00-59-59">00:59:59</a>]  And the kids are fantastic, but also--

[<a id="01-00-02">01:00:02</a>]  - Because that's one of those tempting fantasy

[<a id="01-00-04">01:00:04</a>]  that people think about, but what I know is that

[<a id="01-00-07">01:00:07</a>]  probably the alternative might could have been even worse.

[<a id="01-00-10">01:00:10</a>]  I don't know what could have been worse.

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  - Yeah, exactly.

[<a id="01-00-12">01:00:12</a>]  Because I was a fucking idiot back then.

[<a id="01-00-14">01:00:14</a>]  And it's only through the suffering I went through

[<a id="01-00-17">01:00:17</a>]  that I actually started to have a fucking clue about life.

[<a id="01-00-20">01:00:20</a>]  - That's true for every guy I would imagine.

[<a id="01-00-24">01:00:24</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, I mean, also we get trained by women.

[<a id="01-00-27">01:00:27</a>]  We're fucking idiots.

[<a id="01-00-29">01:00:29</a>]  And then, you know, and these--

[<a id="01-00-33">01:00:33</a>]  - I mean, of course there's always exception to roles.

[<a id="01-00-35">01:00:35</a>]  Like you look at a guy like Leonardo DiCaprio,

[<a id="01-00-39">01:00:39</a>]  he did it right.

[<a id="01-00-40">01:00:40</a>]  - What, for keeping it young, basically?

[<a id="01-00-45">01:00:45</a>]  - It's funny with him because he's a big environmental guy,

[<a id="01-00-50">01:00:50</a>]  but every time a girl turned 25, he'd get another one.

[<a id="01-00-53">01:00:53</a>]  So he obviously doesn't believe in recycling, you know?

[<a id="01-00-56">01:00:56</a>]  - He doesn't want to recycle some old pussy.

[<a id="01-00-58">01:00:58</a>]  'Cause 25 stuck ancient to that guy, you know?

[<a id="01-01-02">01:01:02</a>]  But you think he's gay?

[<a id="01-01-03">01:01:03</a>]  Is that what it is?

[<a id="01-01-04">01:01:04</a>]  Is this a misdirection?

[<a id="01-01-06">01:01:06</a>]  - I think, no, I think he probably got touched

[<a id="01-01-12">01:01:12</a>]  when he was young.

[<a id="01-01-14">01:01:14</a>]  So he's stuck in sexually in a childhood, childish state.

[<a id="01-01-19">01:01:19</a>]  So it's probably something--

[<a id="01-01-21">01:01:21</a>]  - Isn't that a job mandatory?

[<a id="01-01-23">01:01:23</a>]  Like a requirement these days in Hollywood?

[<a id="01-01-25">01:01:25</a>]  It seems like--

[<a id="01-01-26">01:01:26</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

[<a id="01-01-27">01:01:27</a>]  Because, I mean, for me the thing is--

[<a id="01-01-31">01:01:31</a>]  - I'm being so fucking flippant about it, but yeah.

[<a id="01-01-34">01:01:34</a>]  - The thing is, you remember Britney Spears,

[<a id="01-01-38">01:01:38</a>]  when she, that first hit song she had

[<a id="01-01-41">01:01:41</a>]  where she's dressed as a schoolgirl, and that poster--

[<a id="01-01-44">01:01:44</a>]  - Massive hit, holy shit.

[<a id="01-01-46">01:01:46</a>]  - That poster and the album cover was fucking everywhere.

[<a id="01-01-50">01:01:50</a>]  Now all the boys, I was what, I don't know.

[<a id="01-01-53">01:01:53</a>]  How old was I?

[<a id="01-01-54">01:01:54</a>]  I guess I was like 16, 17 when it came out.

[<a id="01-01-58">01:01:58</a>]  All the boys were like, "Ah, that's hot."

[<a id="01-02-00">01:02:00</a>]  The crazy part is all the girls were like,

[<a id="01-02-03">01:02:03</a>]  "I wanna be her."

[<a id="01-02-04">01:02:04</a>]  - Oh, sure.

[<a id="01-02-05">01:02:05</a>]  - And now the key thing is, is when you look at someone,

[<a id="01-02-09">01:02:09</a>]  it's a projection, to get a photo that you identify with,

[<a id="01-02-14">01:02:14</a>]  where people look at that like a false idol

[<a id="01-02-18">01:02:18</a>]  in the religious sense, is that people look at that

[<a id="01-02-23">01:02:23</a>]  and it connects it.

[<a id="01-02-24">01:02:24</a>]  Now, you put a camera in my face or your face,

[<a id="01-02-28">01:02:28</a>]  we're like, "Get that shit out."

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  - Don't do it.

[<a id="01-02-30">01:02:30</a>]  - Yeah, we're not trying to project through a camera.

[<a id="01-02-32">01:02:32</a>]  Being able to project through a camera,

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  I think comes from a place of deep trauma

[<a id="01-02-37">01:02:37</a>]  because you're desperately looking for love.

[<a id="01-02-41">01:02:41</a>]  You're, like, okay, off the script,

[<a id="01-02-45">01:02:45</a>]  or, sorry, this crazy?

[<a id="01-02-46">01:02:46</a>]  - No, no, give it, pick up actor.

[<a id="01-02-51">01:02:51</a>]  It doesn't have to be factored through,

[<a id="01-02-53">01:02:53</a>]  but let's say you give me an example.

[<a id="01-02-54">01:02:54</a>]  Somebody that looked like this

[<a id="01-02-56">01:02:56</a>]  probably went through this much trauma, blah, blah, blah.

[<a id="01-02-59">01:02:59</a>]  - Who's that guy that plays the Hobbit

[<a id="01-03-02">01:03:02</a>]  with the big, wide eyes, Elijah Wood?

[<a id="01-03-06">01:03:06</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-03-07">01:03:07</a>]  - I mean, he's another one, he's a projector.

[<a id="01-03-09">01:03:09</a>]  Somebody, he's-- - He's what?

[<a id="01-03-11">01:03:11</a>]  - A projector, I'd say.

[<a id="01-03-13">01:03:13</a>]  He projects something that people go,

[<a id="01-03-15">01:03:15</a>]  "Ah, I feel seen, I am that guy."

[<a id="01-03-19">01:03:19</a>]  And then you've got them, then they come to your movie

[<a id="01-03-21">01:03:21</a>]  and they buy all the bullshit.

[<a id="01-03-22">01:03:22</a>]  - I'm kind of having a hard time following.

[<a id="01-03-26">01:03:26</a>]  You mean he's relatable, or?

[<a id="01-03-28">01:03:28</a>]  - Something about that way of projecting yourself

[<a id="01-03-35">01:03:35</a>]  speaks to other people's soul.

[<a id="01-03-38">01:03:38</a>]  Now, the reason why I think about this

[<a id="01-03-40">01:03:40</a>]  is Richard the Replicant, he's got this.

[<a id="01-03-44">01:03:44</a>]  Now, he was--

[<a id="01-03-45">01:03:45</a>]  - You don't have to mention his name.

[<a id="01-03-46">01:03:46</a>]  I don't know the guy.

[<a id="01-03-47">01:03:47</a>]  I know who you're talking about.

[<a id="01-03-48">01:03:48</a>]  - Yeah, I'll edit it out.

[<a id="01-03-51">01:03:51</a>]  - We just, who knows if we're ever gonna use any of this.

[<a id="01-03-53">01:03:53</a>]  But there's two things about this.

[<a id="01-03-55">01:03:55</a>]  And the first thing--

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  - Now, that's a good attitude, seriously,

[<a id="01-03-58">01:03:58</a>]  because I think whether you use this or not,

[<a id="01-04-02">01:04:02</a>]  this kind of give you conversational practice,

[<a id="01-04-05">01:04:05</a>]  just talking to people, I guess.

[<a id="01-04-07">01:04:07</a>]  No, seriously.

[<a id="01-04-10">01:04:10</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="01-04-10">01:04:10</a>]  - I think the more you do it, you get kind of bitter at it.

[<a id="01-04-13">01:04:13</a>]  - So Richard is, he's managed to blow himself up

[<a id="01-04-18">01:04:18</a>]  in a small way on social media.

[<a id="01-04-20">01:04:20</a>]  But what he does, his face changes

[<a id="01-04-23">01:04:23</a>]  when he's projecting onto a camera.

[<a id="01-04-26">01:04:26</a>]  He's like, it's something about a desire

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  to go through the lens and connect with a person

[<a id="01-04-33">01:04:33</a>]  who's not even there.

[<a id="01-04-34">01:04:34</a>]  And it's something that he--

[<a id="01-04-36">01:04:36</a>]  - He's literally touching you emotionally across the...

[<a id="01-04-40">01:04:40</a>]  No, I'm not joking.

[<a id="01-04-42">01:04:42</a>]  I understand what you're saying.

[<a id="01-04-43">01:04:43</a>]  There are certain people that has that.

[<a id="01-04-45">01:04:45</a>]  - And this woman in Lausanne who'd been deeply fucked up

[<a id="01-04-49">01:04:49</a>]  as a kid and probably sex trafficked by her banker parents.

[<a id="01-04-54">01:04:54</a>]  The first time we fucked, which was in Lausanne,

[<a id="01-04-57">01:04:57</a>]  there was a certain moment where she got my soul.

[<a id="01-05-02">01:05:02</a>]  'Cause we're, like--

[<a id="01-05-04">01:05:04</a>]  - How hard did you punch her?

[<a id="01-05-07">01:05:07</a>]  - No, no, it was like crazy sex, like porn star kind of sex.

[<a id="01-05-12">01:05:12</a>]  And then at a certain point, like we're having a break

[<a id="01-05-16">01:05:16</a>]  and she just gave me this look

[<a id="01-05-19">01:05:19</a>]  and I saw the most lost person I've ever seen in my life,

[<a id="01-05-23">01:05:23</a>]  like desperate for human connection and unable to find it.

[<a id="01-05-28">01:05:28</a>]  - Did you meet her at a meeting or something?

[<a id="01-05-30">01:05:30</a>]  - No, no, I met her through an app called Pure, which is--

[<a id="01-05-34">01:05:34</a>]  - What?

[<a id="01-05-35">01:05:35</a>]  - It's a dating app called Pure.

[<a id="01-05-36">01:05:36</a>]  - Never heard of it.

[<a id="01-05-38">01:05:38</a>]  - I don't know if it's big in America.

[<a id="01-05-39">01:05:39</a>]  It was created in Barcelona.

[<a id="01-05-43">01:05:43</a>]  - Oh, wow.

[<a id="01-05-43">01:05:43</a>]  - And it was, what I found fascinating about this app,

[<a id="01-05-45">01:05:45</a>]  I got into it during the lockdown,

[<a id="01-05-47">01:05:47</a>]  is it's one app where nice women actually reveal

[<a id="01-05-52">01:05:52</a>]  what their sexual fetishes are.

[<a id="01-05-54">01:05:54</a>]  'Cause it protects the privacy in the right way.

[<a id="01-05-57">01:05:57</a>]  But you can say, "I like being fucked in the butt."

[<a id="01-06-01">01:06:01</a>]  You can have tick a box.

[<a id="01-06-03">01:06:03</a>]  Or, "I like candles being burnt on me," or whatever.

[<a id="01-06-07">01:06:07</a>]  And I found it fascinating to find a platform

[<a id="01-06-11">01:06:11</a>]  where normal women were being honest

[<a id="01-06-14">01:06:14</a>]  about their sexual fetishes, 'cause that's very rare.

[<a id="01-06-17">01:06:17</a>]  Like nice girls always say, "I'm a nice girl."

[<a id="01-06-20">01:06:20</a>]  And it's only later on you find out.

[<a id="01-06-22">01:06:22</a>]  But I met her through this, and then--

[<a id="01-06-26">01:06:26</a>]  - You haven't seen her since?

[<a id="01-06-27">01:06:27</a>]  - We had a, we were seeing each other for almost a year.

[<a id="01-06-32">01:06:32</a>]  And then I couldn't handle it, dude.

[<a id="01-06-35">01:06:35</a>]  Like, she got raped twice while I was in,

[<a id="01-06-39">01:06:39</a>]  she's in Lausanne, I'm in Zurich.

[<a id="01-06-41">01:06:41</a>]  And she was, it's possible she was telling me

[<a id="01-06-45">01:06:45</a>]  a bunch of lies, but honestly--

[<a id="01-06-47">01:06:47</a>]  - Wait, she got raped twice when she was dating you?

[<a id="01-06-49">01:06:49</a>]  - While dating me, yes.

[<a id="01-06-51">01:06:51</a>]  I mean, she was, she told me upfront she's a nymphomaniac.

[<a id="01-06-54">01:06:54</a>]  She was probably fucking hundreds of dudes

[<a id="01-06-56">01:06:56</a>]  while fucking me.

[<a id="01-06-57">01:06:57</a>]  - Is it possible?

[<a id="01-07-00">01:07:00</a>]  I mean, I think you already know the answer,

[<a id="01-07-02">01:07:02</a>]  but I think sometimes when you had early childhood trauma,

[<a id="01-07-05">01:07:05</a>]  you're exasperated by doing more of that too.

[<a id="01-07-10">01:07:10</a>]  - Absolutely.

[<a id="01-07-11">01:07:11</a>]  - And not doing anything at all.

[<a id="01-07-12">01:07:12</a>]  The two extremes, going overboard or doing nothing, period.

[<a id="01-07-16">01:07:16</a>]  - Exactly, yeah.

[<a id="01-07-17">01:07:17</a>]  - So I've been told.

[<a id="01-07-20">01:07:20</a>]  - And so, and it was just making me fucking insane.

[<a id="01-07-27">01:07:27</a>]  'Cause I thought I'm a person that can handle

[<a id="01-07-31">01:07:31</a>]  a lot of craziness and still keep my shit.

[<a id="01-07-34">01:07:34</a>]  - Is she around your age or younger?

[<a id="01-07-35">01:07:35</a>]  - Yeah, she's, what, 33, 34 now.

[<a id="01-07-39">01:07:39</a>]  - Oh, God, yeah. - So I know she's 31.

[<a id="01-07-42">01:07:42</a>]  And yeah, and it was like,

[<a id="01-07-47">01:07:47</a>]  my sense of sanity is pretty strong.

[<a id="01-07-49">01:07:49</a>]  And this was, I could feel my sanity starting to crumble.

[<a id="01-07-53">01:07:53</a>]  'Cause it was stuff like,

[<a id="01-07-55">01:07:55</a>]  I mean, she was on this platform like OnlyFans.

[<a id="01-08-01">01:08:01</a>]  So it'd be things like she--

[<a id="01-08-02">01:08:02</a>]  - Is she still on there?

[<a id="01-08-05">01:08:05</a>]  - I can show you some--

[<a id="01-08-06">01:08:06</a>]  - No, no, no, I don't need to see.

[<a id="01-08-07">01:08:07</a>]  I thought she had a full-time professional job.

[<a id="01-08-09">01:08:09</a>]  Maybe I misunderstood.

[<a id="01-08-10">01:08:10</a>]  Or you were talking about somebody else.

[<a id="01-08-11">01:08:11</a>]  - She had a job, but she would also do this weird shit

[<a id="01-08-14">01:08:14</a>]  in her spare time.

[<a id="01-08-15">01:08:15</a>]  She was on Fansly for a while.

[<a id="01-08-18">01:08:18</a>]  - On what?

[<a id="01-08-19">01:08:19</a>]  - Fansly, which is an alternative to OnlyFans.

[<a id="01-08-22">01:08:22</a>]  - I never heard of it.

[<a id="01-08-23">01:08:23</a>]  See, it just shows how little I know.

[<a id="01-08-25">01:08:25</a>]  - And actually, I'd be interested,

[<a id="01-08-28">01:08:28</a>]  I'll show you some pictures,

[<a id="01-08-30">01:08:30</a>]  'cause she also put a bunch of stuff on Reddit.

[<a id="01-08-33">01:08:33</a>]  And I'd be curious to see what you think about

[<a id="01-08-35">01:08:35</a>]  what you see with your--

[<a id="01-08-38">01:08:38</a>]  - I'm fading, and I gotta go to the bathroom.

[<a id="01-08-40">01:08:40</a>]  But how much do we do?

[<a id="01-08-42">01:08:42</a>]  - I think we've done an hour and 10.

[<a id="01-08-44">01:08:44</a>]  That's a good place to start.

[<a id="01-08-46">01:08:46</a>]  Probably a lot of that.

[<a id="01-08-47">01:08:47</a>]  - And maybe yesterday, tomorrow, when we do it,

[<a id="01-08-49">01:08:49</a>]  maybe start off, because last time when you and I,

[<a id="01-08-54">01:08:54</a>]  and Christian did it yesterday,

[<a id="01-08-56">01:08:56</a>]  we got to my elementary school part.

[<a id="01-08-58">01:08:58</a>]  We stopped talking.

[<a id="01-08-59">01:08:59</a>]  - Yeah, we'll get back to it.

[<a id="01-09-00">01:09:00</a>]  - Yeah, not that any of it's important.

[<a id="01-09-04">01:09:04</a>]  But today, the energy of Yoshi was there this morning.

[<a id="01-09-09">01:09:09</a>]  - I mean, I guess maybe, I don't think I was cranky,

[<a id="01-09-11">01:09:11</a>]  but it would just be a matter of fact.

[<a id="01-09-12">01:09:12</a>]  - No, it's funny.

[<a id="01-09-13">01:09:13</a>]  - I finally had sleep, or whatever.

[<a id="01-09-16">01:09:16</a>]  But I'm sleepy again.

[<a id="01-09-17">01:09:17</a>]  - Cool. - All right.

[<a id="01-09-18">01:09:18</a>]  - You don't mind staying here?

[<a id="01-09-23">01:09:23</a>]  - No, it's cool.

[<a id="01-09-25">01:09:25</a>]  - God, I might pass out for like 40 minutes.

[<a id="01-09-27">01:09:27</a>]  - I mean, we can also,

[<a id="01-09-29">01:09:29</a>]  we'll go for a short walk, get some fresh air.

[<a id="01-09-33">01:09:33</a>]  - Okay.
