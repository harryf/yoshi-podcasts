[<a id="00-03-22">00:03:22</a>]  Turner. She's Ralphie May's wife. Oh okay. And then it's a little weird. I mean I

[<a id="00-03-33">00:03:33</a>]  guess I was fine with Ralphie but like once they split I never saw him again.

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  You know like I'll keep missing each other but when they were married and

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  we're together it was always fun to hang out with them because I don't I don't

[<a id="00-03-47">00:03:47</a>]  think Ralphie really knew me but they got to know me a little bit and it's one

[<a id="00-03-51">00:03:51</a>]  of those uncomfortable situations where you have two people comedian they're

[<a id="00-03-55">00:03:55</a>]  married and they split whether they're married or they're dating they're split

[<a id="00-03-58">00:03:58</a>]  it's very uncomfortable for me like I like both of them so what are you

[<a id="00-04-02">00:04:02</a>]  supposed to take aside? You know and there was definitely people that dislike

[<a id="00-04-06">00:04:06</a>]  Lana for I don't understand she's such a lovely person and two when people get

[<a id="00-04-11">00:04:11</a>]  divorced you weren't married to them you don't know what happened in marriage you

[<a id="00-04-15">00:04:15</a>]  know what I mean like so I don't that always made me uncomfortable but but

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  people who didn't like Lana I I always ask them like okay you don't like her I

[<a id="00-04-25">00:04:25</a>]  don't agree with you but you're a friend with Ralphie right they say yes and you

[<a id="00-04-30">00:04:30</a>]  love Ralphie right yes okay since he's been dead how much time have you spent

[<a id="00-04-34">00:04:34</a>]  with Ralphie's kids like if you really love if you really loved him and if you

[<a id="00-04-39">00:04:39</a>]  have Lana that's fine but the kids should be Bob and if you really like

[<a id="00-04-42">00:04:42</a>]  Ralphie don't you think you should spend time because you you claim to like him

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  right? Yeah. Cricket. True. They like Ralphie because they like him but there's

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  also self-interest in Bob where you're you're opening fire. So we were talking

[<a id="00-04-56">00:04:56</a>]  before about you being a Toastmaster which in my eyes that makes you an

[<a id="00-05-05">00:05:05</a>]  absolute faggot like it's a complete disaster it was bad I don't know what I

[<a id="00-05-13">00:05:13</a>]  was thinking no I mean well the thing is called Toastmasters is a bit of a cult

[<a id="00-05-18">00:05:18</a>]  because you meet people what are you talking about it is a bit of a cult you

[<a id="00-05-22">00:05:22</a>]  you meet people maybe you have a funny definition what is called well a cult is

[<a id="00-05-26">00:05:26</a>]  something to me is where you meet you meet some twights that do your thing and

[<a id="00-05-30">00:05:30</a>]  then they they're like we did the thing and then you get curious because you're

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  stupid but within that group nobody knows outside of what they do Toastmasters

[<a id="00-05-38">00:05:38</a>]  are open in public you know exactly what they're doing yeah because a bunch of

[<a id="00-05-42">00:05:42</a>]  loud mouths but alright so so when did you and you and now you've got a house

[<a id="00-05-48">00:05:48</a>]  you got a bunch of comedians in there what when did you do your first what

[<a id="00-05-53">00:05:53</a>]  led you to do you to get up on the comedy stage I mean I took a class with

[<a id="00-05-58">00:05:58</a>]  what's-her-name described she have a stand-up comedy book and I started

[<a id="00-06-07">00:06:07</a>]  doing but I mean I wasn't I wasn't all the new comedy Bible I don't know that I

[<a id="00-06-13">00:06:13</a>]  forgot lady Judy Carter yeah but I was mostly doing speeches actually in the

[<a id="00-06-18">00:06:18</a>]  90s you know like I did some I was really bad public debating stuff in

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  college I was doing public speaking with Toastmaster and I was terrible at it but

[<a id="00-06-32">00:06:32</a>]  what people would say you know you were terrible at it and and but they always

[<a id="00-06-36">00:06:36</a>]  said even the funny but this is like I said in a very funny way but but they

[<a id="00-06-43">00:06:43</a>]  always said I say something interesting that's that was memorable to people I

[<a id="00-06-47">00:06:47</a>]  think like that's probably more important than they all had said like

[<a id="00-06-51">00:06:51</a>]  look when you're starting comedy you're not good at it but very least you want

[<a id="00-06-55">00:06:55</a>]  to say something interesting so even even if they're not laughing there they

[<a id="00-06-58">00:06:58</a>]  want to listen to what you have to say yeah yeah yeah and the problem with a

[<a id="00-07-02">00:07:02</a>]  lot of these kids like they just wing it go up and I think their lives are

[<a id="00-07-05">00:07:05</a>]  interesting and it is but they have to learn to tell it in an interesting way

[<a id="00-07-09">00:07:09</a>]  right and there's two narcissistic to criticize them so I find most lives not

[<a id="00-07-14">00:07:14</a>]  that interesting to be honest I'm sorry like seriously like most people are

[<a id="00-07-20">00:07:20</a>]  fucking boring it's just also I think you're right but if you if you're a good

[<a id="00-07-26">00:07:26</a>]  storyteller you could make it interesting you can make it interesting

[<a id="00-07-29">00:07:29</a>]  you can make it interesting you're right you can make interesting but it's an

[<a id="00-07-32">00:07:32</a>]  uninteresting life that funny people could make it interesting right okay

[<a id="00-07-36">00:07:36</a>]  that's exactly right I think we all agree on that so so and then you get

[<a id="00-07-41">00:07:41</a>]  this feedback where do you where was the first time you ever did comedy comedy

[<a id="00-07-48">00:07:48</a>]  underground comedy wizard yeah 90s and then what happened they laugh then

[<a id="00-07-57">00:07:57</a>]  didn't laugh second third fourth fifth six seven eight nine ten do you remember

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  do you remember what jokes you had on that first time stuff like stuff like oh

[<a id="00-08-13">00:08:13</a>]  Asian drivers not bad drivers we're just choose to busy looking at all the

[<a id="00-08-18">00:08:18</a>]  companies will be taken over stuff like that I don't like pandering but what I

[<a id="00-08-28">00:08:28</a>]  like is like you're going to definitely know you're so far from pandering to any

[<a id="00-08-35">00:08:35</a>]  sort of audience I mean which is weird as an Asian because they have all the

[<a id="00-08-39">00:08:39</a>]  pandas I think because I was so tall and raised by my Korean mother I stick out

[<a id="00-08-49">00:08:49</a>]  you know that saying Japanese like nail the stick out must be hammered in so

[<a id="00-08-54">00:08:54</a>]  you're the nail yeah but I always tell them if the nail sticking out too far

[<a id="00-08-58">00:08:58</a>]  you can't even hammer that and that's a problem for them I just figured out your

[<a id="00-09-02">00:09:02</a>]  perfect audience registered sex offenders no Labradors I mean you can

[<a id="00-09-07">00:09:07</a>]  what does that mean just that you can tell them literally anything and they

[<a id="00-09-10">00:09:10</a>]  will always smile at you shut up but so and how many I mean when you started

[<a id="00-09-22">00:09:22</a>]  like Washington State you don't think show business that night I know one in

[<a id="00-09-25">00:09:25</a>]  my group thought I'm gonna go early and become show business stuff that's just

[<a id="00-09-30">00:09:30</a>]  so crazy but let's go back so you do that you do the Toastmasters yeah

[<a id="00-09-34">00:09:34</a>]  tell me underground you do you do this first show it go how many people I love

[<a id="00-09-40">00:09:40</a>]  30 people whatever but I wasn't really serious about it and I thought why did

[<a id="00-09-46">00:09:46</a>]  why did you do it some I have nothing to do I was working my mom's restaurant and

[<a id="00-09-51">00:09:51</a>]  but did someone did someone go like hey you should do comedy no that never

[<a id="00-09-56">00:09:56</a>]  happened okay because living with comedians you were living with

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  comedians and you had that kind of like influence where you're like oh if they

[<a id="00-10-03">00:10:03</a>]  can do it I can do it well what's the motivation I thought that was fun but

[<a id="00-10-08">00:10:08</a>]  like I was gonna kick out a lot of the public speaking thing because it's like

[<a id="00-10-11">00:10:11</a>]  how you every time we told you not to do something you keep doing stuff we don't

[<a id="00-10-15">00:10:15</a>]  want you to do they don't want to hear stuff like that yeah right so you so

[<a id="00-10-19">00:10:19</a>]  eventually the late 90s are like maybe public speaking is not a thing for me it

[<a id="00-10-25">00:10:25</a>]  is a thing you can make a lot of money but I'm not eloquent and I have bad

[<a id="00-10-29">00:10:29</a>]  pronunciation terrible grammar but only way you could captivate people is like

[<a id="00-10-33">00:10:33</a>]  if you say something wrong and interesting wait what do you mean you

[<a id="00-10-36">00:10:36</a>]  can make money there are people who professional level they do make make why

[<a id="00-10-42">00:10:42</a>]  they just do speeches oh yeah we sorry I asked you my conference I used to do

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  with you sure we're paying people five grand to talk for now yeah but these are

[<a id="00-10-53">00:10:53</a>]  people that are experts in their field no really it doesn't you don't have to

[<a id="00-10-57">00:10:57</a>]  be expert you have to sometime you have to have a compelling feelings you just

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  couldn't be what around why is it why is this a news to you so I thought like the

[<a id="00-11-06">00:11:06</a>]  public I know that Bill Clinton for example is world-renowned as a public

[<a id="00-11-10">00:11:10</a>]  speaker right so having him it is but this is a way this is like a really like

[<a id="00-11-18">00:11:18</a>]  a sneaky way to people pay pay pay them back for the all the favors they exactly

[<a id="00-11-22">00:11:22</a>]  but he makes what a hundred grand for like a way more than that for an

[<a id="00-11-28">00:11:28</a>]  occasion that he would speed even I mean Obama's what probably worth like a

[<a id="00-11-31">00:11:31</a>]  hundred million it wasn't because of the government pension but look at the guy

[<a id="00-11-34">00:11:34</a>]  Chris Williamson is blowing up with his podcast oh yeah that's a podcast that's

[<a id="00-11-39">00:11:39</a>]  not public yeah what is he he he's just he's no he's he but he has have not it's

[<a id="00-11-47">00:11:47</a>]  like I'm not like what what he does yeah captivated audience he's created his own

[<a id="00-11-51">00:11:51</a>]  thing he hasn't it is a very enticing stuff no but hang on all right so there

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  are dudes did this is what you're telling me there are dudes who know

[<a id="00-12-00">00:12:00</a>]  nothing about anything but are good at talking yes and then they travel the

[<a id="00-12-05">00:12:05</a>]  world and make money yes yeah so they don't even need punchlines you remember

[<a id="00-12-09">00:12:09</a>]  the handicapped got I choked well he's doing inspirational speech now yeah but

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  he's so he's because he make more money be inspirational because this

[<a id="00-12-22">00:12:22</a>]  institution have to do shit like that so they make more money but this is just

[<a id="00-12-27">00:12:27</a>]  like yes he has an edge so because all the public speakers that I that I've

[<a id="00-12-33">00:12:33</a>]  seen so far like the fucking TEDx stuff these are people that are technically

[<a id="00-12-38">00:12:38</a>]  experts in whatever they are talking about so they have like one speech in

[<a id="00-12-42">00:12:42</a>]  them do you know what I mean but there's a lady yeah but the thing is that people

[<a id="00-12-49">00:12:49</a>]  want to buy into something people are stupid it's the same reason why you just

[<a id="00-12-55">00:12:55</a>]  gotta repackage yourself right and if if you have enough momentum be it people

[<a id="00-13-01">00:13:01</a>]  going to your shit talking about you you can say anything I have to fucking

[<a id="00-13-06">00:13:06</a>]  rethink my career I was a public speaker from when I was like 16 yeah you're a

[<a id="00-13-11">00:13:11</a>]  priest when I was when I was a pastor no the way you talk I know you more I know

[<a id="00-13-15">00:13:15</a>]  it's more than for a hundred percent sure that you could do it but you just

[<a id="00-13-20">00:13:20</a>]  gotta like package it like why they want to hear right I forgot her name you know

[<a id="00-13-24">00:13:24</a>]  BTK fine torture and kill Gary Ridgeway he's a biggest one of the biggest most

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  serial killing history hit his daughter wrote a book about she's a victim as

[<a id="00-13-39">00:13:39</a>]  well and I know that she makes some money like giving speeches I'm sure like

[<a id="00-13-43">00:13:43</a>]  what's your qualification like your dad's murder bunch of people now you're

[<a id="00-13-47">00:13:47</a>]  speaking as what is it like to be a daughter of a serial killer people pay

[<a id="00-13-52">00:13:52</a>]  money for that okay what it's like to be a son of a priest that's why I keep

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  saying Hitler Shanaa have killed himself he would have a great public speakers he

[<a id="00-14-01">00:14:01</a>]  would have been good on the circuit yeah it's circuit you'll have a couple neo

[<a id="00-14-06">00:14:06</a>]  nazi favorite his favorite rooms are beer halls the Jewish but yeah I mean

[<a id="00-14-16">00:14:16</a>]  how to arrive at final solutions so all right so I was thinking like what gets

[<a id="00-14-23">00:14:23</a>]  you hooked on comedy why why like okay well I mean after a while I was bored and

[<a id="00-14-28">00:14:28</a>]  like I started hanging out with a lot of comedian friends they were doing it I

[<a id="00-14-31">00:14:31</a>]  was just doing it because I have nothing better to do but I never really took a

[<a id="00-14-36">00:14:36</a>]  serious like around 2003 I just may have got made up this bullshit like I guess I

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  could go LA do comedy or whatever and then but I was just running away from

[<a id="00-14-45">00:14:45</a>]  problem I was just dealing I was sick and tired dealing with my family so I

[<a id="00-14-49">00:14:49</a>]  went down it's just fair coincidence it's just that I got a job with the evil

[<a id="00-14-53">00:14:53</a>]  angel Jim Norton was holding a BN somebody called me and said hey Jimmy

[<a id="00-14-59">00:14:59</a>]  should hang out with Yoshi I hang out with him and through Jim I saw like real

[<a id="00-15-03">00:15:03</a>]  the business side of stand-up comedy yeah how many minutes did you have at

[<a id="00-15-08">00:15:08</a>]  that point how many shows you don't be like Jim somebody connect you with Jim

[<a id="00-15-15">00:15:15</a>]  Norton means you're not just an open mic that you know I guess I was kind of

[<a id="00-15-20">00:15:20</a>]  doing it like a farm for joking but not a whole lot they're not good I mean I had

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  a lot of shit jokes and stupid jokes and so you can do what you could do 15 I

[<a id="00-15-31">00:15:31</a>]  guess all right okay so I think I think I hate to admit it but like I think I

[<a id="00-15-38">00:15:38</a>]  was most effective when I'm just kind of telling my point of view in like stories

[<a id="00-15-45">00:15:45</a>]  but they're not really as it is yeah are you good were you sitting down when you

[<a id="00-15-50">00:15:50</a>]  were on stage where you said no no but shut up I think I think I mean hard

[<a id="00-16-01">00:16:01</a>]  time I think I'm most been little I know when you do their shows silence is your

[<a id="00-16-14">00:16:14</a>]  best friend silence is something that you should tolerate yeah and Gary

[<a id="00-16-20">00:16:20</a>]  Shanley supposedly said even with all the province in the world it's like a

[<a id="00-16-24">00:16:24</a>]  one of those Buddhists saying it's those moments of silence is where you find

[<a id="00-16-30">00:16:30</a>]  peace and solution to the world he said something like that I think but I think

[<a id="00-16-36">00:16:36</a>]  one of the horse and Pete episode I think Louie even had that quote but when

[<a id="00-16-42">00:16:42</a>]  you're doing one-man show it's unnerving because when you're a comedian stand-up

[<a id="00-16-46">00:16:46</a>]  comedian you're you're craving for that laughter and attention but once you get

[<a id="00-16-54">00:16:54</a>]  used to it I think I've never used to it like maybe last seven eight nine shows

[<a id="00-16-58">00:16:58</a>]  at Edinburgh and if you're telling story that is meaningful to you and you're not

[<a id="00-17-04">00:17:04</a>]  just saying for the sake of saying it means something and you try you want to

[<a id="00-17-09">00:17:09</a>]  help audience see something that is it's probably good for the world for

[<a id="00-17-13">00:17:13</a>]  themselves they like that you know but I was a little hard on myself and I hate

[<a id="00-17-22">00:17:22</a>]  getting comfortable if you makes me uncomfortable compliments yeah I'd

[<a id="00-17-26">00:17:26</a>]  rather get booed to get an attack because you hate yourself what are you

[<a id="00-17-30">00:17:30</a>]  talking I mean maybe maybe a little bit of that but it's not I'm the same it's

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  it's where my brain goes or people give me compliments is there's an implicit

[<a id="00-17-42">00:17:42</a>]  power move to that so if somebody says hey I saw you did you were great like

[<a id="00-17-49">00:17:49</a>]  and I and part of me is I'll go fuck yourself like it was related to that

[<a id="00-17-54">00:17:54</a>]  what's that what's the power move it's patronage it's like going well done

[<a id="00-17-59">00:17:59</a>]  little boy it's oh shit it's and and there's an element of when people give

[<a id="00-18-04">00:18:04</a>]  you compliments so that it's like a second a lot of them is coming from good

[<a id="00-18-08">00:18:08</a>]  place and maybe because you never knew your dad it isn't that is is simply I

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  mean my I'm allergic to any form of manipulation and there's a lot of people

[<a id="00-18-25">00:18:25</a>]  for example you must have had this there's sometimes if you do a good show

[<a id="00-18-29">00:18:29</a>]  yeah and you go good laughs there's always some content the audience so

[<a id="00-18-34">00:18:34</a>]  wants to come and suck your energy out right after and tell you that you were

[<a id="00-18-38">00:18:38</a>]  great and then tell you they've got a better joke than you have yeah fuck out

[<a id="00-18-44">00:18:44</a>]  of you and you just got like just leave me alone but people just want to talk

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  about themselves that's usually what it is but yeah but it isn't but this is a

[<a id="00-18-51">00:18:51</a>]  this is another level of life do you think then like a compliment is always

[<a id="00-18-58">00:18:58</a>]  no hot because what I'm is there no way that I can be actually heartfelt and

[<a id="00-19-06">00:19:06</a>]  honest yeah I'm sure it can but I'm always suspicious so nine out of ten

[<a id="00-19-12">00:19:12</a>]  it's yeah because I should because because I come from fundamentalism people

[<a id="00-19-18">00:19:18</a>]  are assholes they're like like and and the biggest assholes are the ones being

[<a id="00-19-23">00:19:23</a>]  dishonest about their assholishness the ones that are telling you they're nice

[<a id="00-19-28">00:19:28</a>]  and they're here to be I want to give you a compliment oh yeah oh yeah oh my god

[<a id="00-19-33">00:19:33</a>]  you were so great it's like really and yeah and and that's yeah there's there's

[<a id="00-19-41">00:19:41</a>]  a whole set of lies and toxicity around this whole thing I'm not that jaded no

[<a id="00-19-49">00:19:49</a>]  no I mean what he's saying I'm sure that's partially true but there's not

[<a id="00-19-54">00:19:54</a>]  other times they're very I mean they're very generous what they're saying you

[<a id="00-19-59">00:19:59</a>]  know it's just that I mean if you want a confidence just suck baby but but it was

[<a id="00-20-05">00:20:05</a>]  a little it was a little unnerving but I have to say out of all the shows I did

[<a id="00-20-09">00:20:09</a>]  even though there are two shows I did that one night was fun if you're gonna

[<a id="00-20-14">00:20:14</a>]  ask me which was more meaningful it's the show that I did in Embron and that's

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  shit I said I did on Tuesday you know yeah but I think but isn't the beauty of

[<a id="00-20-23">00:20:23</a>]  comedy that you actually did the biggest feedback that you are getting the most

[<a id="00-20-27">00:20:27</a>]  important feedback that you're getting is the immediate one so if the joke you

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  land you get nothing yeah if the joke lands you get laughter and that's that's

[<a id="00-20-35">00:20:35</a>]  the most honest feedback that you can get because people don't really control

[<a id="00-20-40">00:20:40</a>]  that like yeah there's no point if you had a great gig you knew you had a great

[<a id="00-20-47">00:20:47</a>]  gig there is no point of someone walking up to you and go oh my god what a great

[<a id="00-20-51">00:20:51</a>]  like yeah no yeah I mean the other side of it is if you do really well I've

[<a id="00-20-56">00:20:56</a>]  seen this with some visiting comedians where people once talked to people talk

[<a id="00-21-00">00:21:00</a>]  to you after and that's and that and that's a little bit different it's where

[<a id="00-21-05">00:21:05</a>]  I think you had some people wanted to talk to you up to the show last year so

[<a id="00-21-08">00:21:08</a>]  well yeah yeah there was a bunch of them that was that was really really nice

[<a id="00-21-13">00:21:13</a>]  because when you move people that you've opened up something in them and that's

[<a id="00-21-18">00:21:18</a>]  different that's nice it's it's really really nice and I would like to do more

[<a id="00-21-25">00:21:25</a>]  of it what make people laugh no that show because you got another next time

[<a id="00-21-35">00:21:35</a>]  is on the 17th I have to admit when I do those shows it does make me things from

[<a id="00-21-43">00:21:43</a>]  the past melancholy you know or nostalgia that all the people that

[<a id="00-21-47">00:21:47</a>]  remember was part of the show there are no longer with us you know and that's

[<a id="00-21-53">00:21:53</a>]  always tough and there's also because it's six business and sometimes people

[<a id="00-21-56">00:21:56</a>]  disappear because they're dead or they disappear because they want to restart

[<a id="00-22-00">00:22:00</a>]  their lives and they want to just leave that business all together and they can

[<a id="00-22-04">00:22:04</a>]  really associate with people stirring the business I completely get it like

[<a id="00-22-08">00:22:08</a>]  good for you research of his life but it's still sad nevertheless you know

[<a id="00-22-12">00:22:12</a>]  because I don't know half the time are they dead or they just disappear and

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  restart their lives you know yeah yeah so people come and go in that business

[<a id="00-22-20">00:22:20</a>]  alright so the thing that I said I said yeah so you at the house you're the

[<a id="00-22-26">00:22:26</a>]  comedians you started doing comedy and somehow you end up in working a pawn

[<a id="00-22-33">00:22:33</a>]  shop the way the way you tell it is like you began as and it might be in the

[<a id="00-22-39">00:22:39</a>]  entry level so it's like it's like well by late 90s and then well here was a

[<a id="00-22-46">00:22:46</a>]  problem I forgot I met a girl in 94 we were dating she's from Japan about a

[<a id="00-22-53">00:22:53</a>]  house thinking like we're gonna get married so I already signed how it's a

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  piece of shit home but nevertheless I bought it and I could start repairing

[<a id="00-23-00">00:23:00</a>]  the place you know but I guess I was so naive and I didn't understand her

[<a id="00-23-06">00:23:06</a>]  dissatisfaction with that me and a couple other things so soon as we broke

[<a id="00-23-12">00:23:12</a>]  up I'm stuck with a house I thought we would be living together you know so

[<a id="00-23-16">00:23:16</a>]  from 95 to 2003 when I was able to get out of there the whole time I was

[<a id="00-23-25">00:23:25</a>]  basically work and trying to fix the house sell the house I could get out of

[<a id="00-23-28">00:23:28</a>]  there you know and my friend Tina who I met he was in the construction so he was

[<a id="00-23-33">00:23:33</a>]  slowly fixing the house but I was desperately trying to get out of there

[<a id="00-23-37">00:23:37</a>]  because I feel like I was stuck there you know so once it once you were able

[<a id="00-23-44">00:23:44</a>]  to sell it you also had a water cash then no because I made a stupid mistake

[<a id="00-23-49">00:23:49</a>]  helping my mom with her loan so when she needed a loan for her business I thought

[<a id="00-23-55">00:23:55</a>]  you took it against the house yeah so when I fixed the house I got nothing I

[<a id="00-24-00">00:24:00</a>]  bought the money and fix she got all the benefit but there is another thing I was

[<a id="00-24-05">00:24:05</a>]  planning to go to New York because my uncle on lived in New York City and they

[<a id="00-24-12">00:24:12</a>]  signed the deal to rent a facility in lower Manhattan and Bleecker Street but

[<a id="00-24-23">00:24:23</a>]  unfortunately they signed the lease on September 10 2001 it was that I was the

[<a id="00-24-29">00:24:29</a>]  nail studio nail salon yeah they signed the deal a day before 9/11 so like oh

[<a id="00-24-35">00:24:35</a>]  my so they call me September 10th and say hey we signed a deal you could move

[<a id="00-24-41">00:24:41</a>]  in become our bookkeeper whatever and working on the plate well soon as

[<a id="00-24-45">00:24:45</a>]  September 11 2001 happened I could go to New York so I made a decision like I'll

[<a id="00-24-51">00:24:51</a>]  move to LA so it took me another almost year and a half during the time that you

[<a id="00-24-59">00:24:59</a>]  are in Seattle though they'll be yeah you're starting you're starting comedy

[<a id="00-25-04">00:25:04</a>]  you're going to the club are you how often are you doing comedy as much as I

[<a id="00-25-11">00:25:11</a>]  can every night no cuz I had to work at the pawn shop a lot of time whenever I

[<a id="00-25-16">00:25:16</a>]  had a free time when I was free at night I went and so but that's a mystery Harry

[<a id="00-25-20">00:25:20</a>]  so how did you end up working at this pawn shop one of my friend was working

[<a id="00-25-26">00:25:26</a>]  one and he got fired and I got fired from my booking job a bookkeeping job

[<a id="00-25-35">00:25:35</a>]  what was that I lost the job 97 then I was helping my mom I think I finally got

[<a id="00-25-42">00:25:42</a>]  a job summer of 99 and I started working for them

[<a id="00-25-54">00:25:54</a>]  so you're probably like 2002 I thought maybe I won't move but move to LA and

[<a id="00-25-59">00:25:59</a>]  do comedy down there so you're you're you basically I just need any income at

[<a id="00-26-03">00:26:03</a>]  the moment yeah cuz I had a fucking house had to pay mortgage and they need

[<a id="00-26-08">00:26:08</a>]  to have enough money to fix the house and sell it and and then my friend Tina

[<a id="00-26-15">00:26:15</a>]  I think I like 99 Brody moved to New York too so we so we lost one of our

[<a id="00-26-19">00:26:19</a>]  friend it was me Brody and Tina menu oh you all played in the Seattle scene at

[<a id="00-26-26">00:26:26</a>]  the time yeah right okay so every time they said like they know Brody like no

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  you don't know him like that way I do you know yeah but so he went to New York 99

[<a id="00-26-38">00:26:38</a>]  I was busy working pawn shop I tried to do show like once a week or something

[<a id="00-26-42">00:26:42</a>]  but I was just too busy during the shit working for my mom's business by the

[<a id="00-26-47">00:26:47</a>]  time 2002 head oh I work for a tablet video Larry's bookstore and R&R adult

[<a id="00-26-57">00:26:57</a>]  toys in Bellevue which is a rich area and I think what changed for me was 2002 I

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  was able to finally visit Europe and I realized fuck man Seattle is too small I

[<a id="00-27-09">00:27:09</a>]  need to see the rest of the world so I thought I went to Europe twice in 2002 I

[<a id="00-27-13">00:27:13</a>]  also went to Brazil I thought I'm gonna go down there like cuz that's the most

[<a id="00-27-19">00:27:19</a>]  optimal place for travel travel and shows and things like that

[<a id="00-27-24">00:27:24</a>]  did that way and I was getting sick entire Seattle and then my family when

[<a id="00-27-27">00:27:27</a>]  you were traveling to Europe for the first time did you also do comedy when

[<a id="00-27-30">00:27:30</a>]  you travel no that wasn't in the picture back then I don't think that was even

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  possible I mean maybe the England but 2002 rest of the continent year with

[<a id="00-27-41">00:27:41</a>]  stand-up comedy I don't think so yeah good question actually maybe Berlin with

[<a id="00-27-45">00:27:45</a>]  the army army but basis but when I was visiting Europe for the first time it

[<a id="00-27-50">00:27:50</a>]  really changed my mind changed my world view because this is like you know that

[<a id="00-27-55">00:27:55</a>]  when you're raised like American states you have so much fear and you gotta

[<a id="00-28-00">00:28:00</a>]  remember 2002 that's only like I only went to overseas like six months after

[<a id="00-28-04">00:28:04</a>]  9/11 so we definitely had like a really uncomfortable idea like what's the rest

[<a id="00-28-09">00:28:09</a>]  of the world thought about us you know and then you show to the world that all

[<a id="00-28-14">00:28:14</a>]  the how the preconceptions are true some of it but but when I went to overseas I

[<a id="00-28-19">00:28:19</a>]  didn't have to I was stupid to fear like as American because soon as I travel

[<a id="00-28-25">00:28:25</a>]  overseas all they see is like ching chong right they don't think American you

[<a id="00-28-28">00:28:28</a>]  know of course yeah they just say Chinese yeah it doesn't matter what my

[<a id="00-28-32">00:28:32</a>]  my name said you know so what tell me about a birdie Steven so you like you're

[<a id="00-28-39">00:28:39</a>]  on the scene in Seattle yeah like were you were you good buddies the two of you

[<a id="00-28-45">00:28:45</a>]  yeah well like I mean he was close with my friend Tana Manu who I think is

[<a id="00-28-50">00:28:50</a>]  naturally the funniest person I met in Washington State okay he's half half

[<a id="00-28-54">00:28:54</a>]  white half Polynesian so you were you also like hanging out a lot outside of

[<a id="00-28-59">00:28:59</a>]  outside of comedy yeah I was I was in that room when there's a community of

[<a id="00-29-04">00:29:04</a>]  Craig Gass he does incredible voice for Howard Stern show he just he's just I

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  don't but all all his family members death they can't hear anything he's the

[<a id="00-29-14">00:29:14</a>]  only one with a killing everything and because of that environment he just kind

[<a id="00-29-17">00:29:17</a>]  of learned to imitate people watching TV Wow so when you hear when you see Craig

[<a id="00-29-23">00:29:23</a>]  Gass and Howard Stern show he does the impression so many different people like

[<a id="00-29-26">00:29:26</a>]  it's just he's just dead on so anyway he was doing the show he said something he

[<a id="00-29-31">00:29:31</a>]  said something like because Brody said something like because he was a public

[<a id="00-29-35">00:29:35</a>]  access show and he was a number one public access show with him and Tana is

[<a id="00-29-40">00:29:40</a>]  running show one time they did this thing where so Tana Brody's like hey

[<a id="00-29-48">00:29:48</a>]  guys welcome to the african-american church you know these like incredible

[<a id="00-29-51">00:29:51</a>]  church they have the church survey with black people are so much better than

[<a id="00-29-56">00:29:56</a>]  white church come on in and as soon as they walk in they put a different clip

[<a id="00-30-00">00:30:00</a>]  where all this black women show their asses and stuff you know like that so

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  like so they're doing this kind of thing with him and Brody like and so many

[<a id="00-30-09">00:30:09</a>]  people call in during live show and after where the fuck is that church in

[<a id="00-30-13">00:30:13</a>]  Seattle because they have all this black yeah and and Brody and Tana have a

[<a id="00-30-21">00:30:21</a>]  similar sense of humor with me they used to go other people's public access

[<a id="00-30-26">00:30:26</a>]  show so they used to go to the show called they used to go to this guy's show

[<a id="00-30-33">00:30:33</a>]  called 30 minutes of white power so this is a racist guy so Tana's half white and

[<a id="00-30-39">00:30:39</a>]  Samoan and Brody's a Jew but because they're funny they make the racist

[<a id="00-30-43">00:30:43</a>]  guy laugh you know so a guy will show pictures like okay so there's their show

[<a id="00-30-48">00:30:48</a>]  like gigantic faces of Jewish people but they're sideways like this and they'll

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  show facial noses so they'll show noses like this right so there's like Jewish

[<a id="00-30-59">00:30:59</a>]  faces facing this way with their nose sticking yes and then the bottom you see

[<a id="00-31-03">00:31:03</a>]  a black person climbing the noses right so it's a so racist show and Brody so

[<a id="00-31-13">00:31:13</a>]  funny he turned around show his nose like that for the racist guy and they're

[<a id="00-31-17">00:31:17</a>]  so funny the racist can't stop laughing right like cuz so he was saying like

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  okay I hate Jews but I don't mean Jews like Brody oh yes because they're so

[<a id="00-31-29">00:31:29</a>]  funny he can't really stay mad but what's funny with this 30 minutes white

[<a id="00-31-33">00:31:33</a>]  power I think that's what that was the name of the show but every show in last

[<a id="00-31-38">00:31:38</a>]  three four minute the guy always talk about wrestling for some reason and the

[<a id="00-31-43">00:31:43</a>]  biggest Thomas the Rock so it's weird like he's wrong I mean I think so like

[<a id="00-31-48">00:31:48</a>]  90s I mean I don't know actually that's when he kicked off the rock like late

[<a id="00-31-54">00:31:54</a>]  90s early 2000 yeah I think so so like but but that's why Tana Tana would laugh

[<a id="00-31-59">00:31:59</a>]  because he's half Samoan and white he's like I know you racist but that's my

[<a id="00-32-04">00:32:04</a>]  cousin you gotta give some respect so that's the thing like the funny thing

[<a id="00-32-09">00:32:09</a>]  with liberal people they want to make the world better and treat people better

[<a id="00-32-12">00:32:12</a>]  but they have no sense of humor see we're wearing where you see like Tana

[<a id="00-32-16">00:32:16</a>]  and Brody they have so much sense of him even when you're racist even they can't

[<a id="00-32-20">00:32:20</a>]  stay angry with it because they're so funny like how funny is Brody's to have

[<a id="00-32-24">00:32:24</a>]  a such a sense of me they show noses he show his he put his face look sideways

[<a id="00-32-29">00:32:29</a>]  and cut a laugh about it it's a jujitsu move like you dealing with racist you

[<a id="00-32-34">00:32:34</a>]  become bigger racist or you have such a sort of humor that they even they have

[<a id="00-32-38">00:32:38</a>]  to laugh yeah you know I mean that's that's that kind of shit that you could

[<a id="00-32-42">00:32:42</a>]  used to do in Seattle with a name of the show with Jews and Samoans save the

[<a id="00-32-48">00:32:48</a>]  world that was the name of that Jews and Samoans save the world that was the name

[<a id="00-32-52">00:32:52</a>]  of the song okay you know so and it's true and but it's but that show was

[<a id="00-33-00">00:33:00</a>]  right because who is the biggest action star the rock and Jews are helping him

[<a id="00-33-06">00:33:06</a>]  make money it's true Jews and Samoans are saving the world you know what I mean so

[<a id="00-33-12">00:33:12</a>]  but that's what happened with these people that yes there's problem but

[<a id="00-33-15">00:33:15</a>]  they're too serious remember Nietzsche said when you're finding a monster in

[<a id="00-33-20">00:33:20</a>]  process you you better remember not to become monster yourself and that's the

[<a id="00-33-24">00:33:24</a>]  problem with the left liberal people they see injustice in the world so they

[<a id="00-33-28">00:33:28</a>]  were trying to use any mean necessary to save the world but they don't realize

[<a id="00-33-32">00:33:32</a>]  there there are humorless cunt and they become monster they become even bigger

[<a id="00-33-37">00:33:37</a>]  monster than this you don't know I mean that that's that's the thing that they

[<a id="00-33-41">00:33:41</a>]  don't understand like yeah I appreciate you trying to help the world like you

[<a id="00-33-46">00:33:46</a>]  were saying the kids want to save the world first you have to know what is the

[<a id="00-33-51">00:33:51</a>]  real problem - you have to know what's the solution three you have to know you

[<a id="00-33-56">00:33:56</a>]  have the solution and for you able to execute that these young kids are too

[<a id="00-33-59">00:33:59</a>]  optimistic you you have for the for I don't fucking think so yeah comedy is

[<a id="00-34-07">00:34:07</a>]  supposed to make them realize that but this is what I wonder though this

[<a id="00-34-11">00:34:11</a>]  comedy really have that mission like I I find it I find it hilarious of Brody to

[<a id="00-34-17">00:34:17</a>]  do this yeah it's like it's like the level of black clansmen yeah shitty

[<a id="00-34-25">00:34:25</a>]  movie but it has it has an element of calling people out without being in your

[<a id="00-34-32">00:34:32</a>]  face and by the way I can't believe so many people know Brody because I don't

[<a id="00-34-35">00:34:35</a>]  really see him that way he was just my friend Brody sure I guess like the

[<a id="00-34-41">00:34:41</a>]  closer you are to someone you never really understand why I think I should

[<a id="00-34-45">00:34:45</a>]  go but didn't quite a lot to talk about Brody Stevens yeah I I go I'm

[<a id="00-34-50">00:34:50</a>]  discovered him because of listening to this podcast let's talk about sets and

[<a id="00-34-57">00:34:57</a>]  and he has this show where he opens playing a tambourine yeah and 10% gay he

[<a id="00-35-05">00:35:05</a>]  was telling people his 10% gay yeah that might be the show but it's just is this

[<a id="00-35-11">00:35:11</a>]  awkward white guy playing tambourine and doing a high energy yes and it's it's so

[<a id="00-35-17">00:35:17</a>]  it just two minutes of hilarity I like I come watching yeah it just makes me laugh

[<a id="00-35-22">00:35:22</a>]  I mean I missed those years I think I'm done I didn't know at the time I think I

[<a id="00-35-27">00:35:27</a>]  was happy it's 2003 to 2006 because that was the day I just moved to LA I'm

[<a id="00-35-32">00:35:32</a>]  working for evil angel I have I access all those DVDs and it was so crazy

[<a id="00-35-36">00:35:36</a>]  those what DVDs they've those are the original cryptocurrency for me well

[<a id="00-35-42">00:35:42</a>]  creep coin and then and it was high on the porn so like we used to have all

[<a id="00-35-50">00:35:50</a>]  those girls showing up evil angel auditioning so sometime when my friend

[<a id="00-35-53">00:35:53</a>]  wait were you the original casting couch no no I wasn't doing that but my friend

[<a id="00-36-00">00:36:00</a>]  Jeff Martin aka Hatman if you read if you okay he fucks with hat on always fuck

[<a id="00-36-07">00:36:07</a>]  that so Hatman was working for but man yeah and then you had big man there is

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  Christ that was a creative output this there's there was ass man that there's

[<a id="00-36-17">00:36:17</a>]  a pussy man there's all this Jesus Christ so that when I'm in the

[<a id="00-36-20">00:36:20</a>]  convention it was like that was the origin of Marvel Universe like there's

[<a id="00-36-25">00:36:25</a>]  max hardcore there's fuck it at power there's a jake's D you know like I think

[<a id="00-36-29">00:36:29</a>]  but so porn porn was always funny when the when the puns were in there yeah

[<a id="00-36-35">00:36:35</a>]  yeah shitless fest exact exactly the hand the wine the ladle yeah so get this

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  like a lot of the there was a porn cinema or there's porn cinemas in most

[<a id="00-36-49">00:36:49</a>]  Swiss cities they're no longer really used yeah he show me he know where he

[<a id="00-36-53">00:36:53</a>]  knew the location there's in a sec still exists

[<a id="00-36-58">00:36:58</a>]  but it shares a walker and Roland and but I showed him the one that in needed

[<a id="00-37-06">00:37:06</a>]  offers become a child's cinema for kids for parents to get rid of their kids on

[<a id="00-37-12">00:37:12</a>]  Saturday Sunday it's beautiful my cousin and I figured out that in movie adverts

[<a id="00-37-19">00:37:19</a>]  yeah in newspapers also did the adverts for the porn cinema yeah and they were

[<a id="00-37-25">00:37:25</a>]  the funniest fucking titles because they translated English titles of porn yeah

[<a id="00-37-30">00:37:30</a>]  but then made it a pun yeah in German so my favorite one that I will never

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  forget is all of you want the wounded slumpin but that sounds funny the way

[<a id="00-37-44">00:37:44</a>]  you're from that's that right so the phrases Aladdin and the Wonderlamp yeah

[<a id="00-37-52">00:37:52</a>]  right now that was the thing but in German it was transposed to bleeding

[<a id="00-37-58">00:37:58</a>]  Aladdin and the hurt bitches ah but it was in in German it's a pun yeah but so

[<a id="00-38-05">00:38:05</a>]  yeah like a London like one thing is a wound yeah it's like yeah it's a there's

[<a id="00-38-11">00:38:11</a>]  different ways you could try and say this but it's Aladdin and the wounded

[<a id="00-38-15">00:38:15</a>]  bitches I say that's funny but all the all the porn movies were that there was

[<a id="00-38-22">00:38:22</a>]  like there was puns references to big-budget Hollywood movies yes whoever

[<a id="00-38-29">00:38:29</a>]  was saying that I mean that must be the most hilarious office in the world but

[<a id="00-38-33">00:38:33</a>]  it's also easy way to protect yourself because it's considered as a satire

[<a id="00-38-37">00:38:37</a>]  that's the one I'm protecting for obscenity case yeah I've been trying to

[<a id="00-38-41">00:38:41</a>]  remember it like what was that Kevin Koster movie when he was like with

[<a id="00-38-47">00:38:47</a>]  Indians or whatever dancing with the wolves I remember a specific one big

[<a id="00-38-52">00:38:52</a>]  they made about five movies made a reference to dancing with the wolves

[<a id="00-38-56">00:38:56</a>]  like five it's like my cousin and I would literally call each other there

[<a id="00-39-02">00:39:02</a>]  was no text messaging back then we'd literally call each other have you seen

[<a id="00-39-05">00:39:05</a>]  this one I mean the correct but the creativity is that that actually makes

[<a id="00-39-10">00:39:10</a>]  me there's a moment I get a little kind of sad because you missed all snakes it

[<a id="00-39-17">00:39:17</a>]  was it was actually when porn hub blew up and kind of killed the kill the part

[<a id="00-39-22">00:39:22</a>]  of the porn industry I assumed that was actually profitable because all those

[<a id="00-39-27">00:39:27</a>]  those funny movie titles came out of this era where that you can actually

[<a id="00-39-31">00:39:31</a>]  employ a funny person to make a title like this I mean because you know like

[<a id="00-39-37">00:39:37</a>]  the evolution yeah it wasn't the accountant that came up with these names

[<a id="00-39-40">00:39:40</a>]  that's yeah and and you know the whole trope of like the pizza guy and then the

[<a id="00-39-46">00:39:46</a>]  woman folks a pizza guy and that's a whole boy yes in fact yeah a back story

[<a id="00-39-51">00:39:51</a>]  to the porn that that ended with the internet yeah my favorite one is still

[<a id="00-39-55">00:39:55</a>]  the plumber if anyone is laying pipe yeah I mean come on yeah yeah yeah so you

[<a id="00-40-02">00:40:02</a>]  know 2003 I moved February 3rd I left February 1st I would stop working at the

[<a id="00-40-10">00:40:10</a>]  shop in Bellevue I drove down with a friend how was it to move to a place it

[<a id="00-40-14">00:40:14</a>]  actually has good weather I used to live to live in California from 85 to 90 oh

[<a id="00-40-20">00:40:20</a>]  so you knew yeah but I couldn't afford anymore so I moved back with my mom in

[<a id="00-40-27">00:40:27</a>]  1990 but I lived in Washington State from 1990 till 2003 I look back just

[<a id="00-40-33">00:40:33</a>]  right is your mom still alive yes okay and then I move favor I left February

[<a id="00-40-40">00:40:40</a>]  1st 2003 and February 3rd on a day Phil Spector murdered a gal and his resident

[<a id="00-40-46">00:40:46</a>]  on the same day I arrived what LA Phil Spector as in suits Phil Spector as the

[<a id="00-40-54">00:40:54</a>]  former manager for Beatles music producer for music he's a huge entity in

[<a id="00-40-59">00:40:59</a>]  the music world he killed he killed this lady from a house of blues from Sunset

[<a id="00-41-03">00:41:03</a>]  Boulevard if I remember right but that's the day I drove it just confusing Harvey

[<a id="00-41-06">00:41:06</a>]  Spector oh yeah but yeah yeah all right so he killed because the first time when

[<a id="00-41-11">00:41:11</a>]  I moved to California it was a summer of 85 the day I landed in Long Beach when I

[<a id="00-41-18">00:41:18</a>]  was in the middle seat with two hookers were talking the whole time I shut my

[<a id="00-41-21">00:41:21</a>]  eyes pretend like I didn't know what they were saying I think second or third

[<a id="00-41-25">00:41:25</a>]  Asian person was murdered by Richard Ramirez I remember both time when I

[<a id="00-41-28">00:41:28</a>]  arrived in California somebody got murdered that's just California for ya

[<a id="00-41-32">00:41:32</a>]  yeah so and in the day my mom kidnapped me and younger brother when we landed

[<a id="00-41-37">00:41:37</a>]  SeaTac terminal in March 13 1980 that's the day John Wayne Gacy got guilty

[<a id="00-41-44">00:41:44</a>]  verdict in Chicago were you aware of this so no no no I just wear over the

[<a id="00-41-48">00:41:48</a>]  years later oh I remember that day whatever you know so when you when you're

[<a id="00-43-40">00:43:40</a>]  Dimmick she wasn't in like she was infected by the same guy you know so

[<a id="00-43-44">00:43:44</a>]  anyway I went in I told them my work experience she saw me pictures how would

[<a id="00-43-48">00:43:48</a>]  you rearrange this what how would you make a box cover with that so she asked

[<a id="00-43-52">00:43:52</a>]  a bunch of questions and I didn't think she wanted to hire me she's nice but she

[<a id="00-43-56">00:43:56</a>]  didn't want to hire me but I finally got a phone call and they needed help so I

[<a id="00-44-00">00:44:00</a>]  went to the DVD department so very small room with that kind of Chris and recall

[<a id="00-44-04">00:44:04</a>]  so that was my first ten days in LA I got a job with the evil angel it just

[<a id="00-44-11">00:44:11</a>]  imagine if you're if you love baseball you got a job with you the New York

[<a id="00-44-16">00:44:16</a>]  Yankees no for real because evil angels go evil Empire because there's bunch of

[<a id="00-44-20">00:44:20</a>]  major directors working for them it was the biggest most popular porn company at

[<a id="00-44-24">00:44:24</a>]  the time if you're a real porn fan in US North America there's such a thing what

[<a id="00-44-30">00:44:30</a>]  a porn fan massively so fascinating I mean today I was looking for a I couldn't

[<a id="00-44-40">00:44:40</a>]  hear you being sarcastic or no I meant this honestly because like for me porn

[<a id="00-44-46">00:44:46</a>]  was always like a means to an end today today I was looking for this great

[<a id="00-44-50">00:44:50</a>]  track I've been in pursuit of one particular track I remember I put it

[<a id="00-44-54">00:44:54</a>]  twice at pubs in London in 95 94 and it's something reminding me of it today

[<a id="00-45-00">00:45:00</a>]  and then I found a dude on YouTube who's he looks like he's 60 and he's playing

[<a id="00-45-06">00:45:06</a>]  old rave tracks on as you as YouTube shorts and he just says what it is here's

[<a id="00-45-11">00:45:11</a>]  another classic it's fascinating to me because I because a lot of them I'm like

[<a id="00-45-16">00:45:16</a>]  I remember that to you and I didn't know what the fuck it was I was in a club and

[<a id="00-45-20">00:45:20</a>]  you're just like bang your head yeah yeah but the level of autism in this guy

[<a id="00-45-26">00:45:26</a>]  and he's he must have been a DJ at that time some dude somebody has recorded or

[<a id="00-45-31">00:45:31</a>]  got all the porn DVDs and they're like they're like a like a stamp collector

[<a id="00-45-36">00:45:36</a>]  wait oh my god this is my favorite moment now you know how some music

[<a id="00-45-41">00:45:41</a>]  collectors collect LPs yeah I want it I want to find the guy that has a porn

[<a id="00-45-48">00:45:48</a>]  collection all DVDs and it's like this is an original Yoshio by actually there

[<a id="00-45-54">00:45:54</a>]  are people like that though for real yeah no come on I you know I had a

[<a id="00-46-01">00:46:01</a>]  customer sometimes they go into the shop they're looking at VHS tapes you know

[<a id="00-46-05">00:46:05</a>]  they'll look at front back this motherfucker look at the sides and the

[<a id="00-46-11">00:46:11</a>]  back end in front and I've told you this before like hey man I want my money back

[<a id="00-46-16">00:46:16</a>]  this girl on the bucks go inside she wasn't in the movie they do shit like

[<a id="00-46-19">00:46:19</a>]  that you know but man these motherfuckers study like CSI Van Nuys you know they

[<a id="00-46-27">00:46:27</a>]  study that thing and there's times like you remember that scene you know when

[<a id="00-46-31">00:46:31</a>]  you did a rogue adventure number three that scene three there's a two tranny

[<a id="00-46-35">00:46:35</a>]  and a guy I mean I worked on it but I don't remember that detail at all but

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  like you'll meet these guys like they remember every single thing about it so

[<a id="00-46-44">00:46:44</a>]  were you disappointing them were they expecting it's like you're dead you're

[<a id="00-46-48">00:46:48</a>]  Gandalf of porn basically you know you're dead you're the white wizard what

[<a id="00-46-53">00:46:53</a>]  I'm talking about an average fan like that you know but like these fanatical

[<a id="00-46-56">00:46:56</a>]  ones yeah like sometimes I can't answer them questions because like they

[<a id="00-47-00">00:47:00</a>]  remember everything Jesus Christ or they want an autograph or whatever you know

[<a id="00-47-05">00:47:05</a>]  but when you're when you're in LA and you get this job and I assume this job

[<a id="00-47-10">00:47:10</a>]  pays okay it was pretty long and when I started but it was enough for me to pay

[<a id="00-47-17">00:47:17</a>]  because I had some little bit of savings but 2003 to 2006 looking back it wasn't

[<a id="00-47-23">00:47:23</a>]  really I wasn't really happy at that time were you doing open mics in LA are

[<a id="00-47-31">00:47:31</a>]  you are you landing in LA and you're you're starting the job and this is a

[<a id="00-47-36">00:47:36</a>]  day job I presume yes you don't have to write at it at night so if I'm behind I

[<a id="00-47-42">00:47:42</a>]  have to stay up all night sometimes sure but but it's a regular day job you go to

[<a id="00-47-46">00:47:46</a>]  an office you do your thing but when John when Jim was hosting a being a

[<a id="00-47-51">00:47:51</a>]  couple times or great for Simmons or David tell they always call me and ask

[<a id="00-47-56">00:47:56</a>]  me for advice and things you know outside you get some of those because

[<a id="00-48-01">00:48:01</a>]  they were hosting a V&M war shows but so they wanted advice but I remember day

[<a id="00-48-08">00:48:08</a>]  from late 90s working at a giggles comedy club so I kind of knew them they

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  also kind of knew like I had something to do with porn so down the road like

[<a id="00-48-19">00:48:19</a>]  when Dave did a V&M war show for twice or Dave's old porn I was consulting on

[<a id="00-48-24">00:48:24</a>]  it so they're asking for like what do you think of this joke or this kind no

[<a id="00-48-28">00:48:28</a>]  well not Dave but he was like hey what is this girl popular or hey what do you

[<a id="00-48-33">00:48:33</a>]  think about this girl in this scene or whatever yeah that I could answer right

[<a id="00-48-37">00:48:37</a>]  oh and they would go specific in their sex I I fit like a really weird

[<a id="00-48-42">00:48:42</a>]  intersection of like I'm not expert in everything about porn but I'm one of the

[<a id="00-48-47">00:48:47</a>]  bridge if you want somebody from porn instead of comedy world name another one

[<a id="00-48-52">00:48:52</a>]  who kind of no detail on both it's kind of hard to find one and 2003 when Brody

[<a id="00-48-58">00:48:58</a>]  was doing warm-up for man Joe so that's how I met Joe Rogan I knew Stan how from

[<a id="00-49-05">00:49:05</a>]  comedy underground for late 90s but hey would you mind bringing me DVDs because

[<a id="00-49-11">00:49:11</a>]  sometimes a rough audience enticing them with free DVD they'll calm down which is

[<a id="00-49-16">00:49:16</a>]  true so I did that and also whenever they needed like a major porn star that

[<a id="00-49-21">00:49:21</a>]  was a Stanhope move no Brody Brody Brody was in warm-up we should try that in

[<a id="00-49-27">00:49:27</a>]  Switzerland but sometimes I'm people do you think still have a DVD player we

[<a id="00-49-34">00:49:34</a>]  might have to supply the DVD player as well but most likely actually we don't

[<a id="00-49-38">00:49:38</a>]  know many mp3 thumbstick yeah so you know so 2003 summer was I go 2003 was

[<a id="00-49-50">00:49:50</a>]  significant year for me because I wasn't really serious about the comedy at all

[<a id="00-49-53">00:49:53</a>]  but a couple things happen one I made Russell Peters that's a big one I also

[<a id="00-49-58">00:49:58</a>]  did I brought a bunch of DVDs for warm-up for the man show and and I was

[<a id="00-50-05">00:50:05</a>]  like a year and a half away from going to tonight's show with Jim and bring

[<a id="00-50-09">00:50:09</a>]  DVD porn where even when Jim was in town I was I had access to tonight shows then

[<a id="00-50-13">00:50:13</a>]  so that's that gave me that call a nice view of our show business and stuff you

[<a id="00-50-18">00:50:18</a>]  know so so you're basically if I if I put it in like like you've escaped your

[<a id="00-50-26">00:50:26</a>]  family you're like this is the first time you're making your life happen for

[<a id="00-50-30">00:50:30</a>]  you yeah I don't have to worry about any sort of having into the interference

[<a id="00-50-34">00:50:34</a>]  and and you live in a dream you're like you're you're doing this job some of

[<a id="00-50-39">00:50:39</a>]  it's like grindy yeah editing but you're also like you're meeting porn stars this

[<a id="00-50-45">00:50:45</a>]  is like yeah I've been meeting show business people and you're doing comedy

[<a id="00-50-50">00:50:50</a>]  this yeah this feels like a bit like living the dream I guess I guess so I

[<a id="00-50-54">00:50:54</a>]  didn't know at the time because I think 2002 or 3 I started going to the porn

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  convention Europe so I started meeting a lot of European porn statue so I can't

[<a id="00-51-04">00:51:04</a>]  I became like a little bit of fixture you know and so I was walking so that's

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  that's also status like there's people like oh he's the man I hate when they

[<a id="00-51-14">00:51:14</a>]  say that but but the Brody used to say in different podcasts he even said it to

[<a id="00-51-18">00:51:18</a>]  Joe Rowe Joe Rogan in like Stanhope Stanford Stanhope was happy because one

[<a id="00-51-24">00:51:24</a>]  time I brought him like five to seven vintage shit porn or something so they

[<a id="00-51-32">00:51:32</a>]  were watching shit porn while they're taking break from man show and then

[<a id="00-51-36">00:51:36</a>]  remembering I brought I brought vanity the trench transgender porn star can I

[<a id="00-51-41">00:51:41</a>]  that's the one of who I introduced to Mike Tyson to that one I have to tell

[<a id="00-51-45">00:51:45</a>]  Harry this so here's the moment when I'm standing in the green room with this man

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  and Stanhope walks in so I guess if you provide someone with shit porn they will

[<a id="00-51-58">00:51:58</a>]  never forget who you are because this is this is what sound of it as soon as he

[<a id="00-52-02">00:52:02</a>]  walks in and he's already drunk as a skunk at that moment as soon as he walks

[<a id="00-52-05">00:52:05</a>]  in he looks around the room was like these are all boring comedians Yoshi how

[<a id="00-52-10">00:52:10</a>]  are you well here's the thing I brought porn and Stanhope's mom used to come up

[<a id="00-52-22">00:52:22</a>]  to me smoke and say Yoshi big cocks bring me lesbian bondage and do you have

[<a id="00-52-33">00:52:33</a>]  fisting do you have those really weird Japanese born like it's really weird to

[<a id="00-52-38">00:52:38</a>]  talk to anybody else talking down through miles Sam's mom but she said

[<a id="00-52-41">00:52:41</a>]  bring me all this what cuz she was she was in reviewing porn a man Joe oh yes

[<a id="00-52-46">00:52:46</a>]  yeah yeah she had that job yeah so I was like this odd guy like new porn or

[<a id="00-52-54">00:52:54</a>]  whatever so that's kind of spread walk then after that anytime they need porn

[<a id="00-52-58">00:52:58</a>]  I'll just like call from my people that I didn't know they have my numbers and

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  stuff you know number so people would hand over in your number whenever they

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  have anything related to more like one time there's outbreak HIV and somebody

[<a id="00-53-12">00:53:12</a>]  from chemo contact me and said they need to do a funny skit so I got Lexington

[<a id="00-53-17">00:53:17</a>]  Steel and Joe denial on the show yeah or I destroyed a family because one other

[<a id="00-53-27">00:53:27</a>]  guy was a stepfather drew denial and June and I was mom started doing porn so

[<a id="00-53-35">00:53:35</a>]  she's an old lady doing gangbang and stuff and I jokingly say I could get you

[<a id="00-53-39">00:53:39</a>]  on some Howard Strange Show and I kind of had something though because I talked a

[<a id="00-53-43">00:53:43</a>]  couple my friends working for Howard I don't know how her but this is oh yeah

[<a id="00-53-47">00:53:47</a>]  send me those information next thing you know they're on the Howard Strange Show

[<a id="00-53-52">00:53:52</a>]  and eventually like marriage and in divorce this and that's like I feel kind

[<a id="00-53-56">00:53:56</a>]  of weird about that because I was just joking and we were supposed to joke in

[<a id="00-54-00">00:54:00</a>]  and when Johnny Keys he was friend of mine he was one of the first black men

[<a id="00-54-04">00:54:04</a>]  to fuck a white woman on camera behind the great door in like late 60s they

[<a id="00-54-08">00:54:08</a>]  really say when in San Francisco I jokingly told him he'll be watching to

[<a id="00-54-11">00:54:11</a>]  porn child Johnny she started porn yeah I miss fucking this bitches whatever so

[<a id="00-54-16">00:54:16</a>]  like so he went to ABN so I thought I had you know the way Michael joined back

[<a id="00-54-22">00:54:22</a>]  playing basketball the second time after baseball you got him a position so he

[<a id="00-54-27">00:54:27</a>]  went I think he did a couple movies but like that was really weird when I was

[<a id="00-54-32">00:54:32</a>]  just joking to these people and I should do it they ended up fucking doing them

[<a id="00-54-35">00:54:35</a>]  that that movie that you mentioned before the old porn from San Francisco

[<a id="00-54-40">00:54:40</a>]  that was on the great door yeah that was two brothers right the producers behind

[<a id="00-54-44">00:54:44</a>]  it yeah Mitchell brothers one killed the other one yes exactly so this is this is

[<a id="00-54-49">00:54:49</a>]  Charlie Sheen made the movie about this is how porn started this is a fascinating

[<a id="00-54-53">00:54:53</a>]  story there are two brothers for in San Francisco that kind of created porn as

[<a id="00-54-58">00:54:58</a>]  we know we're seeing they were doing porn in New York and LA San Francisco but

[<a id="00-55-03">00:55:03</a>]  San Francisco porn was more like artsy yeah it was like it was a little dark it

[<a id="00-55-08">00:55:08</a>]  was the French cinema of porn yeah at the time and these these brothers were

[<a id="00-55-15">00:55:15</a>]  heavily influential in anything porn related they would I think they were

[<a id="00-55-20">00:55:20</a>]  mostly like libertarian in a sense yeah but one guy was a real major cocaine

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  that's done by the murder yeah brother yeah so Charlie Sheen produced and made

[<a id="00-55-30">00:55:30</a>]  that move I forgot the name of the movie but he and his real brother played that

[<a id="00-55-35">00:55:35</a>]  brothers and it did the movie Charlie Sheen knows a lot about porn obviously

[<a id="00-55-40">00:55:40</a>]  porn star but he was very comfortable in that world and so this this lady

[<a id="00-55-46">00:55:46</a>]  vanity yeah with two eyes because she got sued by the other vanity in Prince's

[<a id="00-55-51">00:55:51</a>]  movie so she had to put two eyes yeah and she which is kind of funny because

[<a id="00-55-58">00:55:58</a>]  it looks like two balls right yeah yeah how did you I mean were you were you

[<a id="00-56-04">00:56:04</a>]  friends or she was one of the star for you boy angel booth at January so we

[<a id="00-56-08">00:56:08</a>]  remember so like that that she I remember like Sundays were the last day

[<a id="00-56-12">00:56:12</a>]  for the convention go from Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday yeah you end the

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  porn show at the end of that on the day of the Lord because they have a they have

[<a id="00-56-21">00:56:21</a>]  a big award shows they have a big on war shows they drink a lot so they show up

[<a id="00-56-28">00:56:28</a>]  the next day with our words but they're all fucked up and vanity always do

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  something weird because everybody was interested taking pictures but like a

[<a id="00-56-35">00:56:35</a>]  lot was within the last hour of the convention she'll pull her pants and do

[<a id="00-56-39">00:56:39</a>]  the helicopter with his dick a lot of these guys that it was a she so they

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  they they're having a hard time reconciling this to think that they

[<a id="00-56-48">00:56:48</a>]  because a lot of people still not familiar with then when they say

[<a id="00-56-51">00:56:51</a>]  transgender they think somebody dressed women's clothes that's transvestite

[<a id="00-56-54">00:56:54</a>]  that's different yeah so so I had experience but I have to say 1999 to

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  2006 those porn years was like I didn't realize how happy I was because how

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  crazy that shit was my life was really really crazy with like when I was living

[<a id="00-57-10">00:57:10</a>]  in Washington when Tana's girlfriend got mad at him cheating on him so she broke

[<a id="00-57-15">00:57:15</a>]  into the house I have to pin this bitch down to call the cops on her I don't I

[<a id="00-57-20">00:57:20</a>]  mean it's a funny thing like there's no times in you don't break into my

[<a id="00-57-24">00:57:24</a>]  fucking house I don't care if you're white like I call the cops on the air

[<a id="00-57-26">00:57:26</a>]  but I've had times in my life where it's like the level of insane shit going on I

[<a id="00-57-33">00:57:33</a>]  mean not nothing at your level of insanity but still weird and there's

[<a id="00-57-39">00:57:39</a>]  something about when crazy shit is happening it makes you feel alive yeah

[<a id="00-57-45">00:57:45</a>]  because it's just like I like this next week is gonna be a disaster because I'm

[<a id="00-57-52">00:57:52</a>]  all over the place I can't do basic functional stuff but for the laughs for

[<a id="00-57-58">00:57:58</a>]  the lols for the telling your friends I guess what happened yeah it's like it's

[<a id="00-58-04">00:58:04</a>]  like the biggest kind of ego well you know what happened one time Tana like

[<a id="00-58-08">00:58:08</a>]  all kinds of girls but he likes black girls a lot so he he he got this black

[<a id="00-58-13">00:58:13</a>]  girl pregnant but he didn't know she disappeared and she just reappeared when

[<a id="00-58-17">00:58:17</a>]  the kid is like maybe two years old well so when she showed up like that's your

[<a id="00-58-22">00:58:22</a>]  son can you convince you your roommate to go to lunch like I'll buy you lunch

[<a id="00-58-27">00:58:27</a>]  what I'm like all right I went so like I drove Tana and we went to some place to

[<a id="00-58-31">00:58:31</a>]  sizzler right so we're sitting eating like I don't want to really want to have

[<a id="00-58-35">00:58:35</a>]  anything to do with it first meeting of the kid is in a sizzler yeah but since

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  I'm getting free meal like I mean right and tennis like tennis like tennis like

[<a id="01-01-19">01:01:19</a>]  with them whatever the problem you have whatever well year and a half after that

[<a id="01-01-24">01:01:24</a>]  incident he was dating this girl and like he got caught cheating and the

[<a id="01-01-33">01:01:33</a>]  whole time we were trying to figure out how the fuck this bitch knows every time

[<a id="01-01-36">01:01:36</a>]  you're sure he's still living with it Tanya was living with me but somehow she

[<a id="01-01-40">01:01:40</a>]  knew whenever Tanya was cheating on her with another girl she just happened to

[<a id="01-01-45">01:01:45</a>]  reappear well what happens we I didn't realize she's sneaking the house fuck

[<a id="01-01-50">01:01:50</a>]  with our voice message just set it up in a way that she could call in and get the

[<a id="01-01-53">01:01:53</a>]  messages so we were like how the fuck this bitch figure out anyway the last

[<a id="01-01-58">01:01:58</a>]  time she saw Tina at the club with another girl she got so mad left and I

[<a id="01-02-04">01:02:04</a>]  just then my say I was tired so I was gonna go home and take a nap and go go

[<a id="01-02-07">01:02:07</a>]  drive up to Seattle way to have a video my midnight shit and soon as I drove in

[<a id="01-02-12">01:02:12</a>]  the house this the doors open like god dammit Tanya you forgot the lock the

[<a id="01-02-16">01:02:16</a>]  soon as I'm walking this fucking bitch is ram-sacking the house taking all the

[<a id="01-02-21">01:02:21</a>]  things keep up with Tina once again I understand you're mad at him but but it

[<a id="01-02-27">01:02:27</a>]  doesn't give you right to break it into my house you understand you yeah so I

[<a id="01-02-32">01:02:32</a>]  pinned this bitch down on the floor and every time call 9-1-1 she clicked the

[<a id="01-02-36">01:02:36</a>]  phone and hang up so and I'm not gonna paint punch her in the face cuz I'm not

[<a id="01-02-42">01:02:42</a>]  that dumb if I bruise the white woman I'm going to jail so I pinned her down

[<a id="01-02-46">01:02:46</a>]  carefully like the way I used to pin down those crack heads at the tablet video

[<a id="01-02-50">01:02:50</a>]  store I find finding 9-1-1 show that and the cop show that I was so mad I made a

[<a id="01-02-57">01:02:57</a>]  mistake because soon as I say Tina they called him I want to prosecute this bitch

[<a id="01-03-02">01:03:02</a>]  you need to go to jail but she was afraid of losing her professional

[<a id="01-03-06">01:03:06</a>]  license the nurse and I got to the point like cops are ready to arrest me like

[<a id="01-03-11">01:03:11</a>]  what is the point they say like well she doesn't have a record well of course if

[<a id="01-03-16">01:03:16</a>]  you don't arrest her she's never gonna record and obviously you're favoring her

[<a id="01-03-19">01:03:19</a>]  this is my fucking house I'm saying you don't break into people's house and she

[<a id="01-03-25">01:03:25</a>]  did she should go to jail for that but because they talked to Tina Tina said

[<a id="01-03-28">01:03:28</a>]  well just I don't want to get involved whatever they took his side in that take

[<a id="01-03-32">01:03:32</a>]  care I was so angry because I'm one of those like if I fucking spent time pin

[<a id="01-03-36">01:03:36</a>]  you this 5-11 bitch down she's pretty but she's a big girl lean but like tall

[<a id="01-03-42">01:03:42</a>]  right and because I don't want to punch a bruiser it was really awkward to call

[<a id="01-03-47">01:03:47</a>]  that's a lot of yeah a lot of fucking work and didn't not not to have this

[<a id="01-03-51">01:03:51</a>]  bitch going to jail man that shit really man but yeah so it was like 99 to 2006

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  was so it was like shit that kind of shit all the fucking time it was so

[<a id="01-04-02">01:04:02</a>]  crazy I gotta say it's also a weirdly intimate scene like there's a point with

[<a id="01-04-06">01:04:06</a>]  all the wrestling where oh fuck no no I was so because she used to say kind of

[<a id="01-04-13">01:04:13</a>]  like kind of insulting thing to me you know because she grew up like upper

[<a id="01-04-18">01:04:18</a>]  class whatever I this so I already had a resentment against her so I was looking

[<a id="01-04-21">01:04:21</a>]  forward to sending her to jail teach her a lesson you know yeah but she taught me

[<a id="01-04-25">01:04:25</a>]  a lesson because people that look like that don't go to jail

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  all right you're going to Kiev right now I'm going to Belgrade tomorrow then

[<a id="01-04-38">01:04:38</a>]  Athens you go to Milan the back here we can't keep track of what the fuck you

[<a id="01-04-42">01:04:42</a>]  say it's too it's too when you're homeless you go only stay so many place

[<a id="01-04-47">01:04:47</a>]  too long the key is stay enough so you have time to the we have a place they
