[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  What was your expectations of this podcast? What was your thoughts?

[<a id="00-00-04">00:00:04</a>]  I still don't know.

[<a id="00-00-07">00:00:07</a>]  So I had a bit of an idea, so like a concept.

[<a id="00-00-11">00:00:11</a>]  Just go with the flow, but you can, if you have questions...

[<a id="00-00-14">00:00:14</a>]  I mean, I think the interesting thing is, and that could be a good starting point,

[<a id="00-00-18">00:00:18</a>]  is that you freak both of us out that you approached Yoshi yesterday to do a podcast.

[<a id="00-00-23">00:00:23</a>]  Is it recording?

[<a id="00-00-25">00:00:25</a>]  Yeah. Can you quickly go away with your vest?

[<a id="00-00-29">00:00:29</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-00-33">00:00:33</a>]  Well, first, why don't you introduce yourself, who you are?

[<a id="00-00-36">00:00:36</a>]  So my name is Ben. I'm 18.

[<a id="00-00-39">00:00:39</a>]  Last name?

[<a id="00-00-40">00:00:40</a>]  Benjamin Madani, actually, or Fox. So Fox is Harry's name, and Madani is my mother's name.

[<a id="00-00-47">00:00:47</a>]  Sure. And Harry is obviously your father?

[<a id="00-00-49">00:00:49</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-00-52">00:00:52</a>]  Yeah, I'm 18. I've lived in Switzerland all my life.

[<a id="00-00-57">00:00:57</a>]  My parents are from Switzerland, England, and my mom is also from Iran.

[<a id="00-01-02">00:01:02</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-01-03">00:01:03</a>]  So yeah, I have roots everywhere, but yeah, I grew up here, so basically, I'm Swiss.

[<a id="00-01-10">00:01:10</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-11">00:01:11</a>]  I had a pretty easy life, got to say, compared to other people, I'd assume.

[<a id="00-01-16">00:01:16</a>]  Yeah. Not your fault.

[<a id="00-01-18">00:01:18</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It sucks, but yeah, no, I'm happy to be here, to grow up here.

[<a id="00-01-25">00:01:25</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-26">00:01:26</a>]  There's ups and downs always in everybody's life, but yeah, that's basically me.

[<a id="00-01-33">00:01:33</a>]  I think, you know, before the show, your dad was saying, trying to keep the mic away.

[<a id="00-01-38">00:01:38</a>]  Oh, I'm doing it again?

[<a id="00-01-40">00:01:40</a>]  No, no, no. My only comment is, you know, there are so many great photographers, you know?

[<a id="00-01-47">00:01:47</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-49">00:01:49</a>]  You probably know a lot of them, and filmers.

[<a id="00-01-53">00:01:53</a>]  I don't know all the names of the cameras and things like that, but I usually like photographers

[<a id="00-01-59">00:01:59</a>]  that use the camera down here, where the lenses down here kind of look down, you know?

[<a id="00-02-04">00:02:04</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-02-05">00:02:05</a>]  The reason is, when you have a camera right here, you have a barrier preventing any sort of connection

[<a id="00-02-11">00:02:11</a>]  with the guy who's taking the person's picture, and I think when you're holding that kind of camera,

[<a id="00-02-18">00:02:18</a>]  there's this kind of wonderful partnership between a person who wants to take a picture of you

[<a id="00-02-24">00:02:24</a>]  and trying to get an essence of who you are, and you will trust somebody when they're not covering themselves, you know?

[<a id="00-02-31">00:02:31</a>]  So I think what your dad was trying to say, that if you have a camera like this, you're almost like,

[<a id="00-02-37">00:02:37</a>]  not hiding, but preventing any sort of connection between two people, and I think podcasts, you know,

[<a id="00-02-44">00:02:44</a>]  unlike radio, it's one of the greatest mediums, because no matter how imperfect and spoken grammatically,

[<a id="00-02-53">00:02:53</a>]  ugly way sometimes, you feel like a genuine, authentic experience between two people talking, you know?

[<a id="00-02-59">00:02:59</a>]  So I think that's what your dad was trying to convey, you know?

[<a id="00-03-03">00:03:03</a>]  Yeah, yeah, probably, yeah.

[<a id="00-03-05">00:03:05</a>]  Also, in comedy, that's a thing, you don't keep the mic in front of your face.

[<a id="00-03-09">00:03:09</a>]  So, you know, I'm obviously open when you ask, but I was a little surprised, because we just barely met yesterday,

[<a id="00-03-20">00:03:20</a>]  and I guess, I mean, your dad was surprised too, so were you planning to do a podcast?

[<a id="00-03-28">00:03:28</a>]  I mean, I'm going to ask you like five minutes, seven minutes, then we'll jump, whatever you want to do,

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  but I was just kind of curious about the whole thing, you know?

[<a id="00-03-35">00:03:35</a>]  Basically, my dad's been doing podcasts for a while.

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  In addition to comedy?

[<a id="00-03-40">00:03:40</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-03-41">00:03:41</a>]  First started comedy, then went over to podcasting.

[<a id="00-03-45">00:03:45</a>]  You know, I like the scene, first of all, like comedy, you know, there's fucked up sides to it,

[<a id="00-03-53">00:03:53</a>]  but also there's like great experiences, just being on stage, I love it myself as well.

[<a id="00-03-59">00:03:59</a>]  Because you told me you did a little bit, right?

[<a id="00-04-00">00:04:00</a>]  Yeah, I've done some, like an hour a year, something like this.

[<a id="00-04-08">00:04:08</a>]  Yeah, so I've been listening to a lot of podcasts, and I've had this idea in my mind since a longer time.

[<a id="00-04-14">00:04:14</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-04-15">00:04:15</a>]  Yeah, so that's kind of why I asked, and I was like, hey, you're an interesting guy, I like, I heard a lot,

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  and I just like talking to you, you know, and kind of what I thought was, you know, it's like, I love getting wisdom from older people,

[<a id="00-04-33">00:04:33</a>]  because like I think there's so much things I could learn from like general wisdom,

[<a id="00-04-41">00:04:41</a>]  things I want to keep in my life, or maybe even share with other people, this is my thought.

[<a id="00-04-47">00:04:47</a>]  Because I'm not sure if you speak to a lot of Gen Z, like I assume not, because like basically nowadays,

[<a id="00-04-56">00:04:56</a>]  like old people, young people, in my opinion, it's two different worlds, they don't really talk to each other.

[<a id="00-05-02">00:05:02</a>]  You want to listen, you want to explain to the audience, because I'm not really quite sure, I mean, how would you define Gen Z, you know?

[<a id="00-05-10">00:05:10</a>]  Because I use this term like millennial, but what are they not exactly knowing?

[<a id="00-05-14">00:05:14</a>]  Because I'm a generation X, you know, is that X? I think that's what, yeah.

[<a id="00-05-20">00:05:20</a>]  I think it's X, yeah, Harry's X as well.

[<a id="00-05-22">00:05:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-23">00:05:23</a>]  So, I think...

[<a id="00-05-25">00:05:25</a>]  It's a certain age category, right?

[<a id="00-05-27">00:05:27</a>]  Yeah, yeah, it's, I don't know, generation, whatever.

[<a id="00-05-31">00:05:31</a>]  There's more now as well.

[<a id="00-05-33">00:05:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-34">00:05:34</a>]  So, yeah, like if I describe Gen X, no, Gen Z, so Gen X is you guys, I guess.

[<a id="00-05-44">00:05:44</a>]  Like, growing up, we, you know, we obviously had phones, and I didn't grow up with a phone until I was 12.

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-55">00:05:55</a>]  And I think 12 wasn't an appropriate age to get a phone, still kind of young, but, you know...

[<a id="00-06-00">00:06:00</a>]  This is interesting coming from a young person, yeah.

[<a id="00-06-02">00:06:02</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-03">00:06:03</a>]  Because isn't it strange, if you're 12, everybody else have cell phone, you don't, that would be a little awkward.

[<a id="00-06-08">00:06:08</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-09">00:06:09</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-10">00:06:10</a>]  And that's like the crazy thing nowadays, I think the age got even lower.

[<a id="00-06-15">00:06:15</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-16">00:06:16</a>]  So, people in primary school have phones, and this is a normal thing.

[<a id="00-06-19">00:06:19</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-21">00:06:21</a>]  You know, I grew up in the forest, which was nice.

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-24">00:06:24</a>]  Not everybody gets that.

[<a id="00-06-26">00:06:26</a>]  I could go in the forest, have fun, you know, come back before sundown.

[<a id="00-06-30">00:06:30</a>]  That was kind of the gist.

[<a id="00-06-32">00:06:32</a>]  But, yeah, you know, you coming from porn, I have a question.

[<a id="00-06-39">00:06:39</a>]  You didn't grow up...

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  Wait, wait.

[<a id="00-06-41">00:06:41</a>]  But...

[<a id="00-06-42">00:06:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  So, your generosity, I was really surprised because I started the show well last night,

[<a id="00-06-51">00:06:51</a>]  but some of it purposely, on purpose, but it didn't really end very well.

[<a id="00-06-57">00:06:57</a>]  So, I was surprised, like, why would you want to interview me with knowing that show went nowhere, you know?

[<a id="00-07-03">00:07:03</a>]  And your dad was surprised because he said you never express thinking about doing podcasts.

[<a id="00-07-09">00:07:09</a>]  So, like, we were kind of like, not complaining, we were just kind of bewildered by the whole thing, you know?

[<a id="00-07-15">00:07:15</a>]  So, my dad, he doesn't listen so much.

[<a id="00-07-17">00:07:17</a>]  So, I've talked about doing podcasts a couple times.

[<a id="00-07-20">00:07:20</a>]  Ah.

[<a id="00-07-21">00:07:21</a>]  But maybe not like actively always saying, yeah, let's do a podcast, let's do a podcast.

[<a id="00-07-25">00:07:25</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-07-26">00:07:26</a>]  But no, like, it didn't have anything to do with the show.

[<a id="00-07-31">00:07:31</a>]  And, you know, like, I think I see, I kind of see past that.

[<a id="00-07-36">00:07:36</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-07-37">00:07:37</a>]  I think, yeah, the show didn't go as well.

[<a id="00-07-40">00:07:40</a>]  Like, I think for me, there was a couple moments where I was like, oh, shit, all right.

[<a id="00-07-44">00:07:44</a>]  You know, where I think the setting, people came there for an open mic and it...

[<a id="00-07-51">00:07:51</a>]  I think I made a mistake because on Tuesday, we specifically say I'll be telling you a lot of stories about adult business.

[<a id="00-07-58">00:07:58</a>]  And then it was open mic, so I did a bunch of standard stand-up show.

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  They laughed in the beginning.

[<a id="00-08-04">00:08:04</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-05">00:08:05</a>]  But I thought, oh, maybe these are like same crap from Tuesday.

[<a id="00-08-08">00:08:08</a>]  They wouldn't have an issue, I think, now that I talked to Christian and your dad.

[<a id="00-08-13">00:08:13</a>]  Like, you got to tell them ahead of time what's going to happen, you know?

[<a id="00-08-17">00:08:17</a>]  Like, if they went to see a Disney show, the last 15 minutes with a creative show, of course, they'll be upset, you know?

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  So, you have to give people reasonable expectation what's going to happen.

[<a id="00-08-28">00:08:28</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-29">00:08:29</a>]  So, okay.

[<a id="00-08-30">00:08:30</a>]  I really enjoyed it.

[<a id="00-08-31">00:08:31</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-32">00:08:32</a>]  Because I kind of also knew what I was getting into.

[<a id="00-08-34">00:08:34</a>]  I knew...

[<a id="00-08-35">00:08:35</a>]  I'm sure your dad mentioned me or something.

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-39">00:08:39</a>]  Okay, I will stop interrupting because I was a little surprised that, you know, you want to talk to me.

[<a id="00-08-44">00:08:44</a>]  I don't know about the wisdom stuff because at the end of the day, I was also kid once.

[<a id="00-08-50">00:08:50</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-51">00:08:51</a>]  People could give you good advice, but if you choose not to take it, it's not good advice anyway, right?

[<a id="00-08-55">00:08:55</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-56">00:08:56</a>]  Well, maybe it is good advice, but it's useless if you don't, you know?

[<a id="00-08-59">00:08:59</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-00">00:09:00</a>]  Or you only take advice things that you already agree with.

[<a id="00-09-03">00:09:03</a>]  That's no advice.

[<a id="00-09-04">00:09:04</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-05">00:09:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-06">00:09:06</a>]  Yeah, I think that has a point because you pick up certain stuff in your life.

[<a id="00-09-10">00:09:10</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-11">00:09:11</a>]  And after a while, I think people just live with that instead of getting more things.

[<a id="00-09-16">00:09:16</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-09-17">00:09:17</a>]  It's like, all right, I've got this base.

[<a id="00-09-19">00:09:19</a>]  People call it even karma.

[<a id="00-09-20">00:09:20</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-21">00:09:21</a>]  I've got this now and I don't need more.

[<a id="00-09-24">00:09:24</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-25">00:09:25</a>]  This is like maybe not even a thing they can control.

[<a id="00-09-28">00:09:28</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-09-29">00:09:29</a>]  But it just happens like that.

[<a id="00-09-30">00:09:30</a>]  So I'm trying to get influence as much as possible.

[<a id="00-09-33">00:09:33</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-09-34">00:09:34</a>]  And I was also 18 and I could imagine situation when your dad's giving you really good advice.

[<a id="00-09-38">00:09:38</a>]  You say, "Fuck that."

[<a id="00-09-39">00:09:39</a>]  Yeah, but I see the same thing like, "Okay, I think they'll take their advice."

[<a id="00-09-42">00:09:42</a>]  We all do that kind of stuff too, you know?

[<a id="00-09-44">00:09:44</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-09-45">00:09:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-46">00:09:46</a>]  That's also a cool thing that you see that.

[<a id="00-09-48">00:09:48</a>]  I think nowadays that's a big thing.

[<a id="00-09-50">00:09:50</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-51">00:09:51</a>]  Gen Z, they don't like listening.

[<a id="00-09-53">00:09:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-54">00:09:54</a>]  But the thing is, yeah, I'd say if I talk about Gen Z, a word that comes up instantly

[<a id="00-10-03">00:10:03</a>]  is highly manipulated.

[<a id="00-10-06">00:10:06</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-07">00:10:07</a>]  I see young people my age.

[<a id="00-10-09">00:10:09</a>]  Because of the social media?

[<a id="00-10-10">00:10:10</a>]  Yeah, totally.

[<a id="00-10-11">00:10:11</a>]  And people don't realize it.

[<a id="00-10-13">00:10:13</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-14">00:10:14</a>]  So like I'm doing it too.

[<a id="00-10-16">00:10:16</a>]  I'm scrolling a lot right now.

[<a id="00-10-17">00:10:17</a>]  I should stop.

[<a id="00-10-18">00:10:18</a>]  I know this.

[<a id="00-10-19">00:10:19</a>]  But yeah, I think this is a big problem.

[<a id="00-10-23">00:10:23</a>]  Even at school, you know, I think there can be better education.

[<a id="00-10-27">00:10:27</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-10-28">00:10:28</a>]  But I think the porn and the social media is a big influence on people's lives.

[<a id="00-10-36">00:10:36</a>]  Okay, I want to hear this because I think when I was your age and when I worked in 30s

[<a id="00-10-42">00:10:42</a>]  for like, you know, however many decade and a half retail, I was dealing with different

[<a id="00-10-47">00:10:47</a>]  customers because they were different genres.

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  Okay, so let's start.

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  Go ask.

[<a id="00-10-52">00:10:52</a>]  I don't know if I could give you an answer to everything, but I'll do my best.

[<a id="00-10-56">00:10:56</a>]  So first question I'm wondering is like when's the first time you got in contact with porn?

[<a id="00-11-05">00:11:05</a>]  Oh, I actually talked about this on Tuesday show, but it's a little long-winded.

[<a id="00-11-15">00:11:15</a>]  But my mother was basically kind of forced to marry my dad.

[<a id="00-11-20">00:11:20</a>]  So they were always fighting.

[<a id="00-11-22">00:11:22</a>]  And one of the night when they're fighting, I think I was five, six, seven.

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  I can't remember.

[<a id="00-11-26">00:11:26</a>]  I was very young.

[<a id="00-11-27">00:11:27</a>]  They're fighting.

[<a id="00-11-28">00:11:28</a>]  And my brother went and tried to stop them fighting better than I could have been like

[<a id="00-11-32">00:11:32</a>]  10, 11 p.m. at night, you know, I went downstairs into the library.

[<a id="00-11-38">00:11:38</a>]  And back then we had this really big books.

[<a id="00-11-41">00:11:41</a>]  So the books, so I opened the book like this, put another book on top of it, put another

[<a id="00-11-46">00:11:46</a>]  book.

[<a id="00-11-47">00:11:47</a>]  So I was trying to make it like a castle.

[<a id="00-11-49">00:11:49</a>]  So I was trying to make a place where I could hide, you know, as I'm marking it, making

[<a id="00-11-55">00:11:55</a>]  it, I was writing a couple books away that I could cover myself in and then notice on

[<a id="00-12-02">00:12:02</a>]  the top corner shelf, there are two, three books I never noticed before.

[<a id="00-12-07">00:12:07</a>]  So I put a chair, got them, and I noticed that this is a very specialized book with

[<a id="00-12-11">00:12:11</a>]  pictures of them, you know, and they're, I guess, really clean version of European nude

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  pictures and things like that.

[<a id="00-12-19">00:12:19</a>]  And I tell the audience, maybe you're too young to know, but back in the day, you know,

[<a id="00-12-24">00:12:24</a>]  '70s, '60s, '70s, '80s, even '90s, they used to put stars over genitalia.

[<a id="00-12-30">00:12:30</a>]  So you look at the porn, they'll cover the nipples and vagina and penis and things like

[<a id="00-12-34">00:12:34</a>]  that.

[<a id="00-12-35">00:12:35</a>]  I think I've seen that in like magazines.

[<a id="00-12-36">00:12:36</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-12-37">00:12:37</a>]  So you did, but I was so young and dumb.

[<a id="00-12-39">00:12:39</a>]  I thought white people always have stars.

[<a id="00-12-43">00:12:43</a>]  So I thought white people are like alien because I didn't know white and black people existed

[<a id="00-12-47">00:12:47</a>]  because when you grow up in Japan in '70s, I never saw any foreigners.

[<a id="00-12-50">00:12:50</a>]  So I thought black and white people are as real as Godzilla, you know?

[<a id="00-12-55">00:12:55</a>]  Oh, wow.

[<a id="00-12-56">00:12:56</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-12-57">00:12:57</a>]  So I saw that.

[<a id="00-12-58">00:12:58</a>]  So it's kind of funny.

[<a id="00-12-59">00:12:59</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-13-00">00:13:00</a>]  But how old exactly were you?

[<a id="00-13-01">00:13:01</a>]  Like...

[<a id="00-13-02">00:13:02</a>]  This is like six or seven.

[<a id="00-13-03">00:13:03</a>]  Six or seven years.

[<a id="00-13-04">00:13:04</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-13-05">00:13:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-13-06">00:13:06</a>]  But it had a, I guess, really positive influence on me because I didn't know what they were

[<a id="00-13-13">00:13:13</a>]  doing.

[<a id="00-13-14">00:13:14</a>]  The sex part, I didn't understand.

[<a id="00-13-15">00:13:15</a>]  But the weird pictures for me was when the couple in those artsy pornographic photograph,

[<a id="00-13-27">00:13:27</a>]  they're hugging each other and kissing each other.

[<a id="00-13-29">00:13:29</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-13-30">00:13:30</a>]  That's a good thing.

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  No, it's the stuff I never saw my parents do.

[<a id="00-13-36">00:13:36</a>]  So when I saw that, I didn't understand what that was.

[<a id="00-13-41">00:13:41</a>]  I never seen people like this, but whatever this was, I thought really with the child

[<a id="00-13-46">00:13:46</a>]  logic, it's wonderful and I wish my parents would do that.

[<a id="00-13-51">00:13:51</a>]  So I think it put me in a path like I didn't have a negative idea of pornography because

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  another thing, most Japanese are not Christian or Jewish people.

[<a id="00-14-01">00:14:01</a>]  So we don't have a negative attitude about nudity and sex, you know?

[<a id="00-14-05">00:14:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-06">00:14:06</a>]  So to answer your question, I don't know, maybe six or seven, but to me, I didn't understand

[<a id="00-14-09">00:14:09</a>]  what they were, but I thought it looked like almost like an instruction where my parents

[<a id="00-14-16">00:14:16</a>]  could be a little bit happier, you know?

[<a id="00-14-18">00:14:18</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-20">00:14:20</a>]  So that's how I was introduced to that stuff.

[<a id="00-14-21">00:14:21</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-14-22">00:14:22</a>]  And like the first movie, how was that?

[<a id="00-14-24">00:14:24</a>]  Oh, first actually porn.

[<a id="00-14-26">00:14:26</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-27">00:14:27</a>]  Like actual movie you've seen?

[<a id="00-14-28">00:14:28</a>]  It was VHS my uncle had in like one of the used tape, he forgot to completely delete

[<a id="00-14-33">00:14:33</a>]  over it.

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  And it was a thing with Ron Jeremy and what's funny is years, decades after that, I ended

[<a id="00-14-43">00:14:43</a>]  up, he's an American porn star and I ended up doing comedy shows with him.

[<a id="00-14-47">00:14:47</a>]  So it's really weird.

[<a id="00-14-48">00:14:48</a>]  Here I was, I think I was 15 or 16 when I saw porn video.

[<a id="00-14-56">00:14:56</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-57">00:14:57</a>]  But did it influence you in like a bad way?

[<a id="00-15-01">00:15:01</a>]  What do you think, like, did it change your life forever fundamentally or something?

[<a id="00-15-07">00:15:07</a>]  Like would you wish you haven't seen it and like something like that?

[<a id="00-15-12">00:15:12</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-15-13">00:15:13</a>]  The last question I like, would you wish you haven't seen porn in that age maybe or ever?

[<a id="00-15-21">00:15:21</a>]  I think you could live a life not really seeing that, you know, cause I think ultimately what

[<a id="00-15-25">00:15:25</a>]  you really need is a healthy attitude and come from loving home, you know?

[<a id="00-15-30">00:15:30</a>]  And a lot of times you can't choose that, you know, loving home.

[<a id="00-15-36">00:15:36</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-15-38">00:15:38</a>]  Just like you can't choose when you actually accidentally see pornography or something,

[<a id="00-15-41">00:15:41</a>]  you know?

[<a id="00-15-42">00:15:42</a>]  But I think now that I'm older, I don't know if it really hurt me, but I think after many

[<a id="00-15-52">00:15:52</a>]  decades after working and thinking about it, okay, here's an example, right?

[<a id="00-15-58">00:15:58</a>]  I have a friend named Tom.

[<a id="00-16-01">00:16:01</a>]  He drives me crazy.

[<a id="00-16-04">00:16:04</a>]  Would you mind passing me the jar of water?

[<a id="00-16-05">00:16:05</a>]  Sorry.

[<a id="00-16-06">00:16:06</a>]  Palm Beach?

[<a id="00-16-07">00:16:07</a>]  You mean?

[<a id="00-16-08">00:16:08</a>]  Palm Beach.

[<a id="00-16-09">00:16:09</a>]  No, no.

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  My friend Tom.

[<a id="00-16-11">00:16:11</a>]  Oh, Tom.

[<a id="00-16-12">00:16:12</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-13">00:16:13</a>]  He comes from very well off family, I think.

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  Nice neighborhood.

[<a id="00-16-19">00:16:19</a>]  Safe.

[<a id="00-16-20">00:16:20</a>]  Dad works.

[<a id="00-16-21">00:16:21</a>]  Mom's home.

[<a id="00-16-22">00:16:22</a>]  Vacation.

[<a id="00-16-23">00:16:23</a>]  You have insurance.

[<a id="00-16-26">00:16:26</a>]  Every needs its cover and you go to a good school, you have a nice home.

[<a id="00-16-31">00:16:31</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-33">00:16:33</a>]  But it drives me crazy when I see those kids in that class, middle class, upper middle class,

[<a id="00-16-38">00:16:38</a>]  white kids, because they have such a good life, they have to listen to hip hop, listen

[<a id="00-16-44">00:16:44</a>]  to kids who live in inner city and just miserable life, right?

[<a id="00-16-47">00:16:47</a>]  So when you listen to those music, they're keeping it real, like, you know, they talk

[<a id="00-16-51">00:16:51</a>]  about real shit because they're suffering, they're sad, broken home, no job, humiliation,

[<a id="00-16-58">00:16:58</a>]  hunger, fearful life, would I have a future, you know?

[<a id="00-17-03">00:17:03</a>]  And I think it's one of those things, like, when you have it too good, you fantasize about

[<a id="00-17-08">00:17:08</a>]  those gang shit, right?

[<a id="00-17-10">00:17:10</a>]  But I tell those kids, if those kids, the rapper, had a chance to live the life you

[<a id="00-17-15">00:17:15</a>]  did, they would take that right away.

[<a id="00-17-17">00:17:17</a>]  Because yes, they have a lot of success and money now, but they're not any different from

[<a id="00-17-23">00:17:23</a>]  white people.

[<a id="00-17-24">00:17:24</a>]  Every kid wants to have a happy, loving home, to have a loving parent, right?

[<a id="00-17-29">00:17:29</a>]  So it's kind of ironic to me that these kids, having wonderful parents and home and stuff,

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  that's not good enough.

[<a id="00-17-37">00:17:37</a>]  They still have to fantasize about something else.

[<a id="00-17-39">00:17:39</a>]  This is the real irony of life, like, you have too many good things?

[<a id="00-17-44">00:17:44</a>]  That's still good enough.

[<a id="00-17-45">00:17:45</a>]  You have a terrible life, that's definitely not good enough, you know?

[<a id="00-17-49">00:17:49</a>]  Everybody fantasizes things.

[<a id="00-17-50">00:17:50</a>]  So whether it's music or acting or pornography, at the end of the day, I always remind people

[<a id="00-17-56">00:17:56</a>]  it's one thing.

[<a id="00-17-57">00:17:57</a>]  It's fantasy.

[<a id="00-17-58">00:17:58</a>]  Yeah, that's amazing, yeah.

[<a id="00-18-00">00:18:00</a>]  So yeah, in the end, people, I think, put worth, do you think people put a lot of worth

[<a id="00-18-09">00:18:09</a>]  on like, outside, like, coincidence, I think, like, so, I've heard this expression, there's

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  never enough money, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, this is, this is weird.

[<a id="00-18-25">00:18:25</a>]  I think this is a big problem, you know, nowadays, people get too, too involved in this money

[<a id="00-18-33">00:18:33</a>]  thing.

[<a id="00-18-34">00:18:34</a>]  And as soon as they get it, they seem not happy, you know, and they've done studies where

[<a id="00-18-41">00:18:41</a>]  I don't know what's the number, let's say, like 40 or 50,000, but they're saying like

[<a id="00-18-44">00:18:44</a>]  around that amount, that pays just enough, you could live off, you could actually have

[<a id="00-18-49">00:18:49</a>]  decent life, you know, but most people can be happy, in my opinion, but they don't want

[<a id="00-18-56">00:18:56</a>]  to because they want, because to most people, happiness is conditional, like, I'm happier

[<a id="00-19-04">00:19:04</a>]  if I make six figures, I'm happier if my girlfriend had a bigger breast, I'm happier if my dad

[<a id="00-19-09">00:19:09</a>]  doesn't harass me, that, that, that, if you could somehow kind of accept that, but to

[<a id="00-19-14">00:19:14</a>]  realize how lucky you are, you actually could be happy if you want to, but I don't think

[<a id="00-19-19">00:19:19</a>]  most people want to be happy, because as soon as you make a certain amount of money, they

[<a id="00-19-23">00:19:23</a>]  want more, or they compare themselves to others, you know, and I did that too, and it's a really

[<a id="00-19-29">00:19:29</a>]  difficult thing to overcome, but once again, if you come from a solid home, I met plenty

[<a id="00-19-34">00:19:34</a>]  of them where they seem like happy, you know, maybe they have half of it, whatever, compared

[<a id="00-19-39">00:19:39</a>]  to other successful people, but I don't want to say like, is, so where, where do the people

[<a id="00-19-47">00:19:47</a>]  like from porn come, which kind of background, like I'm wondering, I think, I think, I, I,

[<a id="00-19-55">00:19:55</a>]  I'd assume there's a lot of people from a good background, I think good family, you

[<a id="00-20-01">00:20:01</a>]  know, for example, I mean, do you feel comfortable answering this, because it is your show, but

[<a id="00-20-04">00:20:04</a>]  like, when did you see porn, what, what, how old were you, I was 12, actually, on your cell

[<a id="00-20-10">00:20:10</a>]  phone, it was on my laptop, actually, I see, yeah, so I blame my cousin, because she was

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  like, yeah, you should watch porn, you know, why haven't you watched porn before, you know,

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  how, how much older she is, she, she's like, four years older, wow, yeah, smoking, and,

[<a id="00-20-28">00:20:28</a>]  you know, I don't know, I was, I was in bullshit at school, so they sent me away to Germany

[<a id="00-20-33">00:20:33</a>]  to my grandma, so first, it was really fun, until I noticed, shit, I don't have anything

[<a id="00-20-40">00:20:40</a>]  to do, you know, yeah, and, and then she just showed me porn, and this was my life, basically,

[<a id="00-20-49">00:20:49</a>]  for like two, three months, yeah, I just remember, you know, being on my phone, like, laptop

[<a id="00-20-56">00:20:56</a>]  all day, yeah, feeling like shit, but jerking off, you know, yeah, whatever, it's just,

[<a id="00-21-01">00:21:01</a>]  yeah, I don't know, that was how I got introduced to it, and actually, I think that, for me,

[<a id="00-21-10">00:21:10</a>]  it wasn't beneficial, so, I don't think it's beneficial for anyone, you know, because,

[<a id="00-21-16">00:21:16</a>]  yeah, that's, that's a fair point, but, like, I think there's something that people express

[<a id="00-21-24">00:21:24</a>]  with that, and I'm wondering how, how is there another way to express, like, this, this deep,

[<a id="00-21-29">00:21:29</a>]  deep thing, and I think a lot of insecurity comes with it, as well, yeah, you know, this

[<a id="00-21-35">00:21:35</a>]  is why, if I answer the question, I just remember something, regarding young people, you know,

[<a id="00-21-40">00:21:40</a>]  because I got weirded out during podcasts, I mean, you're 18, so I don't feel weird about

[<a id="00-21-45">00:21:45</a>]  this, but, when I did the show last year, Fringe, I did one man show called Adult Content,

[<a id="00-21-51">00:21:51</a>]  so I was talking about my years in the business, and my, my thought about certain things that

[<a id="00-21-55">00:21:55</a>]  was good, and things that bothered me, one show, I told this to your dad, too, there's

[<a id="00-22-00">00:22:00</a>]  this kid, of the show, gave me 50 pounds, which is like $70, $80, it's a lot of tip,

[<a id="00-22-05">00:22:05</a>]  you know, like, I was really grateful, because I was broke, yeah, he said, yeah, I've been

[<a id="00-22-10">00:22:10</a>]  listening for, like, 10, 11 years, like, I said, what? So, I asked him, how old are you?

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  I think he turned 17, 18, that means he was hearing me say stuff like, punching a handicapped

[<a id="00-22-20">00:22:20</a>]  person in the face, or getting hookers, when he was 7, 8 years old, and, I don't really

[<a id="00-22-27">00:22:27</a>]  like that, you know, because I think, believe me, you know, you'll probably meet a lot of

[<a id="00-22-32">00:22:32</a>]  your friends your age, they're like, no, shut the fuck up, I'll watch porn, whatever, but,

[<a id="00-22-38">00:22:38</a>]  believe me, once you become a dope, you want best for your kids, and, you know, once you

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  become a dope, you're not going to be a kid anymore, right? Why take that time away from

[<a id="00-22-50">00:22:50</a>]  a kid? I prefer kids stay kids, however long they can, because once you turn a dope, there's

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  no going back, you know? So, I think, I don't agree with your cousin, I'm sure she's a nice

[<a id="00-23-01">00:23:01</a>]  person, I don't agree with that, because I think, look, when I was sending porn, back

[<a id="00-23-08">00:23:08</a>]  in the day, or when you're a kid looking for porn, we literally had to walk into woods,

[<a id="00-23-13">00:23:13</a>]  like a used magazine, at a garbage can, or something like that. Yeah, I think that's

[<a id="00-23-17">00:23:17</a>]  so cool, like the stories you guys have from porn are so much more interesting. Or, when

[<a id="00-23-23">00:23:23</a>]  we stay streaming, we go down the little river, and sometimes there's like a used magazine

[<a id="00-23-30">00:23:30</a>]  floating down, and you're trying to dry it, you know? Oh, shit. And this is how stupid

[<a id="00-23-36">00:23:36</a>]  I am, and naive I was, I used to collect stamps, right? And sometimes stamps, you find old

[<a id="00-23-42">00:23:42</a>]  stamps in an envelope, and if you want to take it, what you do is you cut the piece,

[<a id="00-23-47">00:23:47</a>]  put it in the water, it loosens, and you take the stamp, and you dry it, then you have that

[<a id="00-23-53">00:23:53</a>]  stamp, right? I'm so dumb, when I found used magazine, sometimes pages are stuck together,

[<a id="00-23-59">00:23:59</a>]  I didn't know why they were stuck together, because I'm so fucking young. So, I would

[<a id="00-24-03">00:24:03</a>]  put it in like a bucket of water to kind of loosen those pages, and then I take all those

[<a id="00-24-09">00:24:09</a>]  pages in like a garage where my uncle and aunt can find it and dry it up. Then, of course,

[<a id="00-24-15">00:24:15</a>]  four or five years when I was walking down the street, and I realized, "Oh, my God, now

[<a id="00-24-19">00:24:19</a>]  I know why they were stuck together, right?" I'm a stupid motherfucker. So, back in the

[<a id="00-24-25">00:24:25</a>]  day, we really have to work... It probably smelled weird when they dry it, I guess. So,

[<a id="00-24-30">00:24:30</a>]  back in the day, you really work hard to get a magazine, but the problem is it's so easy

[<a id="00-24-35">00:24:35</a>]  for you guys. Even if porn is healthy, it's like going to Disneyland. Some of the fun

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  is that you have to stay in line for like 90 minutes to get the ride, and the ride is

[<a id="00-24-46">00:24:46</a>]  only two minutes or something, right? But it's just a process of waiting with your friend

[<a id="00-24-50">00:24:50</a>]  talking to them, finally you get the ride, it's kind of fun. But imagine if you go to

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  Disneyland, there's no line, you do all the rides within less than 30 minutes, then what

[<a id="00-24-58">00:24:58</a>]  are you going to do? You've done everything, right? If you make porn accessible too easy,

[<a id="00-25-04">00:25:04</a>]  okay, you just made it easy. There's no like... You didn't earn the porn, if that makes sense

[<a id="00-25-09">00:25:09</a>]  to you. And I think watching that much porn when they're young age, when your brain has

[<a id="00-25-16">00:25:16</a>]  to develop, I'm not a scientist, but I just don't think that's healthy. And it also creates

[<a id="00-25-22">00:25:22</a>]  unrealistic expectation because when you're 12 and 13, so all that porn and all those

[<a id="00-25-28">00:25:28</a>]  beautiful women at that age, you see more beautiful women than even King Solomon could

[<a id="00-25-34">00:25:34</a>]  imagine thousand years ago, right? So it's not good for you, you have a certain expectation,

[<a id="00-25-40">00:25:40</a>]  and it's not good for girls because girls think only way I could keep my boyfriend is

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  I get porny, act like one of the porn girls even though I don't enjoy it. So everybody's

[<a id="00-25-50">00:25:50</a>]  doing something that, well, I guess you're supposed to treat women like that. Do you

[<a id="00-25-54">00:25:54</a>]  know what I'm saying here? Yeah, totally. There's nothing authentic about the experience,

[<a id="00-25-58">00:25:58</a>]  everybody's pretending. Yeah, this is what's going on like here, you know, in the cities.

[<a id="00-26-03">00:26:03</a>]  Because I'm not in a team, so I don't know what you guys do. Yeah, like, like a lot of

[<a id="00-26-07">00:26:07</a>]  girls compete on Instagram, you know, men do as well. They compete with, with their

[<a id="00-26-11">00:26:11</a>]  biceps, you know, being the best male possible. Yeah, I get it. I get it. It's cool. But actually,

[<a id="00-26-19">00:26:19</a>]  I don't, I don't ride the trend, I try to steer away from trends because I'm used to,

[<a id="00-26-24">00:26:24</a>]  I don't know, I'm used to, like how he told me this, you know, if you follow a trend,

[<a id="00-26-29">00:26:29</a>]  if you see an ad in the internet, or outside, it's probably going to be bullshit, you know,

[<a id="00-26-36">00:26:36</a>]  the newest coffee that you can drink out of a bottle. Yeah, there's always probably, at

[<a id="00-26-40">00:26:40</a>]  the end of it, what it comes down to is like, it's about money, you know. Yeah, it's always

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  about money. And like, it's crazy how much this influences our, our society and our gen,

[<a id="00-26-53">00:26:53</a>]  I guess, generation. Yeah. But yeah, so I have a, I have a deeper question now. Yeah.

[<a id="00-27-04">00:27:04</a>]  You know, nowadays, like we have, we have a lot of like, feminist walks. And this is

[<a id="00-27-08">00:27:08</a>]  a big topic that's being talked about as well. Yeah. You know, rape. And I'm wondering, do

[<a id="00-27-15">00:27:15</a>]  you think it's possible to have no rape ever? And if so, you know, how, how do you think

[<a id="00-27-23">00:27:23</a>]  this would be a possible thing for, for people just to be, you know, happy and not, you know,

[<a id="00-27-29">00:27:29</a>]  be, be insane, kind of. The company that used to work for Evil Angel, back in the day, maybe

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  it is now, but back in the day, when it's working, it's one of the biggest company and

[<a id="00-27-38">00:27:38</a>]  one of the most reputable company with a lot of big names working for it. My friend, Joey

[<a id="00-27-47">00:27:47</a>]  Severo, he's one of the great, one of the old school, like porn guy from 70s, 80s, you

[<a id="00-27-52">00:27:52</a>]  know, like he's hauling fame. Like if you know porn, that's a, that's a name, you know,

[<a id="00-28-00">00:28:00</a>]  just like some famous football coach or something like that. Or just a legend, you know, he

[<a id="00-28-06">00:28:06</a>]  was also a performer player, but he was later became director, AKA coach, you know. Wow.

[<a id="00-28-12">00:28:12</a>]  97, he was the first guy to film transgender porn. There's always been transgender porn,

[<a id="00-28-21">00:28:21</a>]  but he's the mainstream porn guy bringing transgender to a mainstream porn company,

[<a id="00-28-25">00:28:25</a>]  you know. Kind of shocked me. And then his, his co-partner and my future boss, a guy named

[<a id="00-28-33">00:28:33</a>]  John Steliano, in 97, he tested positive HIV from a transgender prostitute, you know. The

[<a id="00-28-40">00:28:40</a>]  reason why I bring up transgender because I didn't particularly care for it, but when

[<a id="00-28-47">00:28:47</a>]  I started working for them, one of my jobs was work on transgender porn. So I made enough

[<a id="00-28-52">00:28:52</a>]  transgender stars. I have so much sympathy for them because they're a little different

[<a id="00-28-57">00:28:57</a>]  from transgender people these days because I think some of them are transgender because

[<a id="00-29-00">00:29:00</a>]  you're trendy to be one. Yeah. Not because, not because they really struggle and be that,

[<a id="00-29-05">00:29:05</a>]  right. But back in those days, when I knew a lot of the transgender people, I have nothing

[<a id="00-29-10">00:29:10</a>]  but sympathy. Believe me, they didn't choose to be that. They were born like that. And,

[<a id="00-29-14">00:29:14</a>]  what do you mean by born like that? So straight born or born into a family and that family

[<a id="00-29-22">00:29:22</a>]  raised this kid? No, no. I think, I don't think they're doing it for like ulterior motive.

[<a id="00-29-28">00:29:28</a>]  They really are trans and they have a biological leader or man, but they identify femininity

[<a id="00-29-36">00:29:36</a>]  and they feel women. And there's the other side, which is ladies who feel they're born

[<a id="00-29-41">00:29:41</a>]  like a woman, but they identify male gender. Do you think this comes from trauma or like

[<a id="00-29-46">00:29:46</a>]  DNA? I'm not an expert. It could be all kinds of different reasons, but the reason I bring

[<a id="00-29-50">00:29:50</a>]  it up because I had this couple of occasions when I was talking, I met several females

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  who were transitioning into a man. You know what they told me? Only they would know this.

[<a id="00-30-05">00:30:05</a>]  After taking male testosterone, I mean testosterone to increase their testosterone level to transition

[<a id="00-30-10">00:30:10</a>]  into a man. She now, he cannot believe because they grew up as a woman that this urge the

[<a id="00-30-18">00:30:18</a>]  men have, the need to have sex, they kind of had an inkling, but once they take this

[<a id="00-30-24">00:30:24</a>]  male hormone, they cannot believe the urge is that strong. And key point that she was

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  amazed that the men choose not to assault women and rape them. It's not that this thing,

[<a id="00-30-37">00:30:37</a>]  it's not that this doesn't happen. It does. It's terrible. It is absolutely terrible when

[<a id="00-30-42">00:30:42</a>]  a woman gets raped. It's terrible when a man gets raped. But she said this that she was

[<a id="00-30-48">00:30:48</a>]  really happy to realize this because that just means that so many men having this urge

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  choose not to rape women. They're actually more good men than bad. Well, yeah, that's

[<a id="00-30-59">00:30:59</a>]  true. That's definitely true. You know, back then, probably like in the Viking days. Yeah.

[<a id="00-31-06">00:31:06</a>]  It's like there are plenty of women who lied about sexual assault as well, you know. Yeah.

[<a id="00-31-10">00:31:10</a>]  So I cannot tell you a scenario that is there a society we could live, no rape. You might

[<a id="00-31-17">00:31:17</a>]  as well ask me, can you live a society where no one can make crimes? I don't think that's

[<a id="00-31-20">00:31:20</a>]  realistic either. They are bad people, both men and women and transgender people, you

[<a id="00-31-25">00:31:25</a>]  know. But I just want people to know that when I hear a woman who transgendered into

[<a id="00-31-29">00:31:29</a>]  a man and tell me that, really makes me like kind of happy that there are a lot of good

[<a id="00-31-34">00:31:34</a>]  men. Believe me, you know, you have all this crazy thought when you see a beautiful woman.

[<a id="00-31-39">00:31:39</a>]  You want to have sex. But we try to be a little more dignified. Hopefully you treat them with

[<a id="00-31-45">00:31:45</a>]  respect, you know. Yeah. But you get childish talking to your friends, saying, "Yeah, I

[<a id="00-31-49">00:31:49</a>]  want to fuck her." That's okay. Let's just talk. And thinking about it's fine. You just

[<a id="00-31-53">00:31:53</a>]  don't cross the line and do that, you know. And I think more often, more men choose not

[<a id="00-31-57">00:31:57</a>]  to do that. And this is a good thing. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And only she is credible enough

[<a id="00-32-03">00:32:03</a>]  person for me. Some, there's many, there's feminist, you know, there's the good, the

[<a id="00-32-08">00:32:08</a>]  bad, and ugly versus feminist. There are reasonable ones, like don't think all women, all men

[<a id="00-32-13">00:32:13</a>]  are evil. And then there's some feminists think all men are rapists. That's just unreasonable.

[<a id="00-32-19">00:32:19</a>]  Because that's not true. Yeah. Yeah. That is such a good question, by the way. No worries.

[<a id="00-32-28">00:32:28</a>]  Thanks for the answer. That's an interesting answer to hear. Yeah. I don't know. I don't

[<a id="00-32-33">00:32:33</a>]  know if I'm right, but I'm just telling my experience, you know. I've heard this in Joe

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  Rogan podcast as well that they're pushing. What podcast? Joe Rogan. Yeah. They're pushing

[<a id="00-32-43">00:32:43</a>]  transgenderism. Yeah. I don't know if you say that that way. But in America, so 12-year-old

[<a id="00-32-51">00:32:51</a>]  kids are getting hormone blockers and things. Is this actually a present thing? Does this

[<a id="00-32-56">00:32:56</a>]  happen? Did you see this before? I think 2010, when I was visiting Boston, I have a friend

[<a id="00-33-03">00:33:03</a>]  named Ogi Ogos. He's a professor at Harvard at the time. Really smart guy. Yeah. He wrote

[<a id="00-33-08">00:33:08</a>]  a book called A Billion Wicked Thoughts. So traditionally, when you do sex studies, universities,

[<a id="00-33-14">00:33:14</a>]  as a social scientist, you have to have a group sample, kind of get how people behave,

[<a id="00-33-19">00:33:19</a>]  right? And what is the easiest sample for professors to have? Well, those young people

[<a id="00-33-22">00:33:22</a>]  attending the college. But those samples are sometimes a little biased, especially in like

[<a id="00-33-26">00:33:26</a>]  '50s and '60s, because most of the students are white Anglo-Saxon people. You need those

[<a id="00-33-32">00:33:32</a>]  samples too. But to get an accurate picture of what's going on in society, you need to

[<a id="00-33-38">00:33:38</a>]  interview a bunch of other different people too. Well, the reason why the name of the

[<a id="00-33-42">00:33:42</a>]  book is A Billion Wicked Thoughts is because when Ogi and his academic partner who wrote

[<a id="00-33-48">00:33:48</a>]  the book, Saiga Dom, had one arena where they had billions of individuals thinking certain

[<a id="00-33-56">00:33:56</a>]  things, sexual desires, and it was anonymous, and people are behaving exactly how they behave.

[<a id="00-34-03">00:34:03</a>]  Because if they see your face and interviewing you, some people are more honest than others,

[<a id="00-34-07">00:34:07</a>]  but you're not going to be completely honest. This arena is called internet. So when they

[<a id="00-34-12">00:34:12</a>]  were doing research in early 2000, it's illegal now, but back then, they had complete access

[<a id="00-34-18">00:34:18</a>]  to like Yahoo, Google, and places like that, where people anonymously Google search for

[<a id="00-34-23">00:34:23</a>]  things that they want to see. So they had a billions and billions internet search. Now

[<a id="00-34-28">00:34:28</a>]  if you're Sherlock Holmes, if I have 100 men in a room, I could make a wild guess what

[<a id="00-34-38">00:34:38</a>]  their individual is into, but I'm not going to know for sure. But when you have a billions

[<a id="00-34-43">00:34:43</a>]  internet search, you have a pretty good sample and pattern that some truths are true. Some

[<a id="00-34-50">00:34:50</a>]  facts are true. Like many men are into this kind of stuff and that, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-34-55">00:34:55</a>]  So what was the question? There was a reason why I got on.

[<a id="00-35-03">00:35:03</a>]  Just wondering, is this actually a present thing that 12-year-olds are involved in? Because

[<a id="00-35-11">00:35:11</a>]  I think also 12-year-olds are more influenced by their surroundings. I don't know. I think

[<a id="00-35-18">00:35:18</a>]  I was given an example because it gave me like a scientific explanation what's going

[<a id="00-35-23">00:35:23</a>]  on. I mean, it's very concerning to me because when I watched porn back then, those porn

[<a id="00-35-31">00:35:31</a>]  are more campy and harmless, but you have a wide variety of stuff. It's kind of hard,

[<a id="00-35-36">00:35:36</a>]  and I don't know the best way to protect kids, in my opinion, because you're not going to

[<a id="00-35-42">00:35:42</a>]  get rid of porn. Once the internet's great, it's here forever, and porn's been here forever

[<a id="00-35-47">00:35:47</a>]  as well, and every advance in technology, pornography, kind of benefit from it. So the

[<a id="00-35-53">00:35:53</a>]  only way you could protect kids is if you actually talk to them, right? So either my

[<a id="00-35-58">00:35:58</a>]  feeling these days is that you have to have a sufficient and quality sex education, and

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  if parents don't want that, and I think they have every right to say no, then I will say

[<a id="00-36-11">00:36:11</a>]  to those parents, "Well, if you say no to education at school, then you have to talk

[<a id="00-36-16">00:36:16</a>]  to them at home." Some of them say no to that too. You can't have it both ways. You have

[<a id="00-36-21">00:36:21</a>]  to prepare kids, right? And sex is a big part, just like money management is a big part.

[<a id="00-36-26">00:36:26</a>]  So you want to prepare for your kid. I'm not saying you should talk to them when they're

[<a id="00-36-29">00:36:29</a>]  five or six. When they're 12 or 13, you really need to talk to them, right? So I think it's

[<a id="00-36-36">00:36:36</a>]  not fair because, in my opinion, if you don't talk to your kids, kids still going to talk

[<a id="00-36-41">00:36:41</a>]  and search for that, right? So I think a lot of the kids end up watching porn, and that's

[<a id="00-36-46">00:36:46</a>]  not a sex education. It's fantasy. Yeah, totally. I don't think that answered your question.

[<a id="00-36-53">00:36:53</a>]  Yeah, that's why I'm glad for me to... I don't want to be bluffing or something. I don't

[<a id="00-37-02">00:37:02</a>]  want to, how do you say, push myself, say, "Yeah, I'm good for losing my virginity early."

[<a id="00-37-11">00:37:11</a>]  But I'm actually really glad I did because I see guys nowadays, they talk crazy shit

[<a id="00-37-17">00:37:17</a>]  in my school. "Yeah, I want to rape this bitch." I would never talk like this because I think

[<a id="00-37-28">00:37:28</a>]  I've been in more contact with women and I feel like this is not okay to talk this way.

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  I think especially girls having too many partners, I'm not judging them, but I think when you

[<a id="00-37-43">00:37:43</a>]  have too many partners, what I think is going to happen is that it's hard to have a meaningful

[<a id="00-37-49">00:37:49</a>]  relationship because you're going to compare whoever you're dating at the time with the

[<a id="00-37-53">00:37:53</a>]  10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 men you've been with. These comparison things are really, really...

[<a id="00-37-59">00:37:59</a>]  I don't think it's very helpful, I don't think. At the end of the day, if you find the right

[<a id="00-38-04">00:38:04</a>]  person and you're the right person for that, you guys are not perfect, you're right for

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  each other, you can't have a wonderful, meaningful thing. Ultimately, I think that's what people

[<a id="00-38-14">00:38:14</a>]  are looking for because believe me, I've worked in that business for a long time. Eventually,

[<a id="00-38-18">00:38:18</a>]  I got to the point where I'm second-looking at porn because you make anything work out

[<a id="00-38-23">00:38:23</a>]  of something, even if you love something, if they make a job out of it, you're going

[<a id="00-38-27">00:38:27</a>]  to end up hating that stuff, believe me. You know what I mean? Once you make responsibility

[<a id="00-38-34">00:38:34</a>]  and headache, it's not fun anymore. That's where I'm at.

[<a id="00-38-38">00:38:38</a>]  I get that would work. This leads me to another question. You used to work 25 years?

[<a id="00-38-51">00:38:51</a>]  I worked for Evil Angel 9, I worked at the retail shop for 5 and last 10, 12 years. On

[<a id="00-39-00">00:39:00</a>]  and off, I've been consulting and documenting and things like that.

[<a id="00-39-03">00:39:03</a>]  So in this time, I'd assume you were in direct contact with sex for a long time.

[<a id="00-39-11">00:39:11</a>]  Still.

[<a id="00-39-12">00:39:12</a>]  Still? Okay.

[<a id="00-39-13">00:39:13</a>]  I'll give you an example to have some idea. I have a lot of sex worker friends and sometimes

[<a id="00-39-23">00:39:23</a>]  they call me for casting for something, for like movies and televisions. I still get phone

[<a id="00-39-29">00:39:29</a>]  call for that. I consulted like a documenter, so I made one called Porn-Demic. I consulted

[<a id="00-39-35">00:39:35</a>]  on that and we're working on another one called Pariah, one of the worst pornographers. We're

[<a id="00-39-40">00:39:40</a>]  working on that too.

[<a id="00-39-42">00:39:42</a>]  What's the worst pornographer? I don't know.

[<a id="00-39-47">00:39:47</a>]  Okay, he's one of the worst.

[<a id="00-39-48">00:39:48</a>]  I don't want to come from different places when they talk about the worst pornographers.

[<a id="00-39-54">00:39:54</a>]  Maybe the pornographers themselves are like... Yeah, just tell me.

[<a id="00-39-59">00:39:59</a>]  I mean, without getting too much detail, he made a movie called Rough 6-1-2 in like '97,

[<a id="00-40-08">00:40:08</a>]  '98 and I think the company is called Anabolic. They do a lot of rough stuff over there and

[<a id="00-40-15">00:40:15</a>]  we had a copy at the store that worked, R&R Adult Toys. When I saw that, I was kind of

[<a id="00-40-20">00:40:20</a>]  shocked because it's kind of like people didn't want to sell that. The reason why you don't

[<a id="00-40-24">00:40:24</a>]  want to sell in states because you never want to give police the reason to raid your store

[<a id="00-40-28">00:40:28</a>]  because you're selling something that is within community standard, whatever that means.

[<a id="00-40-34">00:40:34</a>]  Oh, that those are the people that decide the joke you did?

[<a id="00-40-39">00:40:39</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-40-40">00:40:40</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's funny. Yeah.

[<a id="00-40-44">00:40:44</a>]  So it's not that we hated the movie, we were always trying not to sell stuff that invite

[<a id="00-40-49">00:40:49</a>]  police and like breaking and ransack the place, you know? But the thing with contusion, his

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  station was con-tu-sion, like contusion, like when you break your arm or whatever, you know,

[<a id="00-41-05">00:41:05</a>]  or concussion, whatever. It's just like a verb play, but he, what he does is he's so

[<a id="00-41-13">00:41:13</a>]  good at looking at the girl, what's her weakness, whether it's like a physical insecurity or

[<a id="00-41-19">00:41:19</a>]  the fact that she was abandoned by her father or something. She'll find something and bring

[<a id="00-41-23">00:41:23</a>]  it up and make you feel ashamed to the point you start crying. Then that's when he sent

[<a id="00-41-27">00:41:27</a>]  a couple of the guys to fuck her.

[<a id="00-41-29">00:41:29</a>]  Oh, wow.

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  He's that kind of guy, you know?

[<a id="00-41-33">00:41:33</a>]  Wow.

[<a id="00-41-34">00:41:34</a>]  So, and I remember seeing guy like that. I remember there's certain percentage of guys

[<a id="00-41-38">00:41:38</a>]  in a business that is, I mean, clearly toxic, but there's something wrong. But there's some

[<a id="00-41-44">00:41:44</a>]  fan base are into that. They like seeing girls crying and they're in physical pain or humiliated,

[<a id="00-41-49">00:41:49</a>]  things like that, you know? It's one thing, like some guys are into humiliated, watching

[<a id="00-41-55">00:41:55</a>]  their wife get fucked by a porn star or they like getting their testicle stumped by shoes

[<a id="00-42-00">00:42:00</a>]  and stuff like that.

[<a id="00-42-01">00:42:01</a>]  Oh, yeah, I've heard this.

[<a id="00-42-02">00:42:02</a>]  Yeah, but stuff like this is okay because that's done to them and women like that. But

[<a id="00-42-06">00:42:06</a>]  doing to women, even if they pretend like they like it, but most likely they're doing it

[<a id="00-42-10">00:42:10</a>]  because they have to pay apartment rent that day or something, you know?

[<a id="00-42-15">00:42:15</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-42-16">00:42:16</a>]  So, there's guy like that, but I have to admit, there's part of me are just fascinated by

[<a id="00-42-22">00:42:22</a>]  that sort of stuff too, you know? It's not my thing, you know? It's not something I'm

[<a id="00-42-26">00:42:26</a>]  into, but when you watch a wide variety of porn like I have, and believe me, I've seen

[<a id="00-42-32">00:42:32</a>]  a lot, and believe me, in addition to watching a lot, I knew some of the whole fame perverts,

[<a id="00-42-39">00:42:39</a>]  the guys who are performers, the thinkers, you know? And like when you're hanging out

[<a id="00-42-42">00:42:42</a>]  with them, it increased my perv IQ to like a borderline genius level. It's not something

[<a id="00-42-48">00:42:48</a>]  I'm proud of, but you understand why you start seeing a pattern where people think the way

[<a id="00-42-53">00:42:53</a>]  they do, you know?

[<a id="00-42-54">00:42:54</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-42-55">00:42:55</a>]  And I think part of the reason I travel the world because whether it's... Are you familiar

[<a id="00-42-59">00:42:59</a>]  with Jeffrey Epstein?

[<a id="00-43-00">00:43:00</a>]  Yeah, yeah, I've heard. I've heard.

[<a id="00-43-02">00:43:02</a>]  Yeah, and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, where I went to her court case for verdict

[<a id="00-43-06">00:43:06</a>]  and sentencing.

[<a id="00-43-07">00:43:07</a>]  Oh, I heard this.

[<a id="00-43-08">00:43:08</a>]  Sent to Trump's case, Harvey Weinstein, Danny Madison, Elizabeth Holmes, SPF, Menendez brothers.

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  I'm going to that French Mazam rape case next month in France, you know?

[<a id="00-43-21">00:43:21</a>]  I haven't heard of this one, but...

[<a id="00-43-22">00:43:22</a>]  So I go because I think after years of working in, a year of traveling to any red light district,

[<a id="00-43-29">00:43:29</a>]  I'm kind of like trying to figure out like why people do what they do, and I'm trying

[<a id="00-43-34">00:43:34</a>]  to do some clinical kind of touch to it, you know? Because I think some of the saddest,

[<a id="00-43-38">00:43:38</a>]  most terrible things happen in the world because people have traumatic childhood and they create

[<a id="00-43-44">00:43:44</a>]  this fantasy to deal with it, and the only way they could enhance that fantasy is to

[<a id="00-43-49">00:43:49</a>]  inflict pain.

[<a id="00-43-50">00:43:50</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-43-51">00:43:51</a>]  So there's a big chunk of serial killer, terrorist, a billionaire business people that fire 10,000

[<a id="00-43-57">00:43:57</a>]  people. Because why rape one girl when you could fire 10,000? You fuck them. You know

[<a id="00-44-02">00:44:02</a>]  what I mean?

[<a id="00-44-03">00:44:03</a>]  So...

[<a id="00-44-04">00:44:04</a>]  When rich people don't have a satisfying sex life, they fuck the poor.

[<a id="00-44-08">00:44:08</a>]  Yeah. Okay. Wow. Okay. That's, that's so crazy. Like, I have...

[<a id="00-44-14">00:44:14</a>]  You don't have to put like, as you young men say, putting dick in the vagina and asshole

[<a id="00-44-20">00:44:20</a>]  to have a sex, or orgasm. There are plenty of people get orgasm, they fuck them, but

[<a id="00-44-26">00:44:26</a>]  not, not through vaginal penetration or anal penetration. You fuck them by many different

[<a id="00-44-32">00:44:32</a>]  ways and they get off on it. And I met, you know, I'm 55 years old, I miss so many kinds

[<a id="00-44-36">00:44:36</a>]  of people like that. Because when you work in show business and you have to know famous

[<a id="00-44-40">00:44:40</a>]  people and you work in porn, weirdly, I had access to a lot of rich people because no

[<a id="00-44-45">00:44:45</a>]  other circumstance they would talk to me. But as soon as somebody rich friend of mine

[<a id="00-44-49">00:44:49</a>]  say, "Hey, Yoshi, work for a photographer." They would know, they would never talk to

[<a id="00-44-53">00:44:53</a>]  somebody from lower class like myself. But when they tell them I work in porn, I miss

[<a id="00-44-57">00:44:57</a>]  so many billionaires because of that. Then after talking to them, I noticed like, huh,

[<a id="00-45-03">00:45:03</a>]  you have a money, but at the end of the day, you are motivated kind of same kind of perverted

[<a id="00-45-08">00:45:08</a>]  gravity like a poor person, but you do more harm, you know? Yeah. Are they like very manipulative?

[<a id="00-45-13">00:45:13</a>]  Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. I could imagine like... There are plenty of decent billionaires. Yeah.

[<a id="00-45-19">00:45:19</a>]  That shit just went wrong. Yeah. But like, after, after like meeting these people and

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  being in contact with a lot of sex, I've heard this opinion that after a while, you know,

[<a id="00-45-33">00:45:33</a>]  you start resenting people. Yeah. Do you experience this? Have you had this before that you just,

[<a id="00-45-40">00:45:40</a>]  you know, just have a resentment? I don't have a resentment. Well, you know what popped

[<a id="00-45-45">00:45:45</a>]  in my head when he said that because I've been in the shoots sometime, a guy and a girl,

[<a id="00-45-52">00:45:52</a>]  and I'm really annoyed because believe me, I cannot do what they do. You know, we all

[<a id="00-45-58">00:45:58</a>]  have pressure job. But imagine you're standing around people watching you and you have to

[<a id="00-46-01">00:46:01</a>]  fuck a girl, keep it hard and give her orgasm and pop on their face, you know? Yeah. It's

[<a id="00-46-09">00:46:09</a>]  a very pressure job, believe me, you know? I find it already difficult with just two

[<a id="00-46-13">00:46:13</a>]  people involved, like me and her. Yeah. So, but a couple of times I was angry because

[<a id="00-46-18">00:46:18</a>]  I want to fucking go home, but he can't keep his dick hard and can't come on her face.

[<a id="00-46-23">00:46:23</a>]  We can't go home until you come on her face, right? So like, oh my God, I just want to

[<a id="00-46-27">00:46:27</a>]  go home. Yeah. Right? I want to go home, take a shower, what, take a shit, take a shower,

[<a id="00-46-35">00:46:35</a>]  have a nice meal or semi decent meal and watch Netflix. I don't want to watch porn because

[<a id="00-46-39">00:46:39</a>]  I did that for 16 hours, right? I just want to go home. So, you know, yeah, I mean, you

[<a id="00-46-48">00:46:48</a>]  start resenting. So, so, so I only resent situations like that, but I have more sympathy

[<a id="00-46-56">00:46:56</a>]  for people now. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Wow. So is there not like a general thinking of you

[<a id="00-47-03">00:47:03</a>]  fucking asshole for being like who you are or like, I don't know, just walking around

[<a id="00-47-09">00:47:09</a>]  on the street. That's how I'd imagine it if let, let's say I have a, I have a massive

[<a id="00-47-15">00:47:15</a>]  body count of like a hundred, I think even 50 would be crazy massive. Um, you have sex

[<a id="00-47-22">00:47:22</a>]  with 50 you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. With 50 people. Okay. After that, I like, I assume

[<a id="00-47-29">00:47:29</a>]  it'd be like, oh yeah, just walking around the street and just hating everybody or just

[<a id="00-47-33">00:47:33</a>]  like, yeah, I don't know. That's, that's what kind of, um, I, I, I think when you're young,

[<a id="00-47-41">00:47:41</a>]  you know, you want to, you know, like I don't really like when people make a point like

[<a id="00-47-47">00:47:47</a>]  president Trump, you know, when he said that, grab the pussy because to me that's locker

[<a id="00-47-52">00:47:52</a>]  talk. Plenty of guys in your age, this, this anywhere. And when you have 18 year old boys,

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  women talking, they talk a lot of shit. Yeah. And that's, that's all what it is. It's shit

[<a id="00-48-05">00:48:05</a>]  because believe me, guys who are getting laid, laid all the time, they don't have to prove

[<a id="00-48-09">00:48:09</a>]  anything. They're getting it, you know, you know what I mean? Like if you're super rich,

[<a id="00-48-12">00:48:12</a>]  you don't have to tell everyone you're rich. You know, you're rich and people know you're

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  rich. You know what I mean? So it's, it's just a talk, you know, but, but at the end

[<a id="00-48-20">00:48:20</a>]  of the day, um, if I had a son or if I had a cousin or somebody I care about, um, yeah,

[<a id="00-48-28">00:48:28</a>]  it might be wonderful to have sex as many beautiful women or whatnot, but, uh, in the

[<a id="00-48-33">00:48:33</a>]  long run when you reach my age, what was the point of that? You know, it's, it's, it's,

[<a id="00-48-39">00:48:39</a>]  um, it's not girl for the good for the girl, but I also think it's not good for the guy,

[<a id="00-48-44">00:48:44</a>]  you know, it's, it's not a, it's not a really dignifying thing. I mean, if you're with somebody,

[<a id="00-48-49">00:48:49</a>]  you love that person at the time. You really meant it. It's wonderful, right? Yeah. But

[<a id="00-48-54">00:48:54</a>]  fucking for sake of fucking, I don't know. I think, um, at the end of the day, you want

[<a id="00-49-01">00:49:01</a>]  to live a meaningful life. Hopefully you want to live a happy life and believe me, last

[<a id="00-49-07">00:49:07</a>]  one or two minutes of a life, you're not going to say two things. Oh, I'm glad I did so many

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  overtime or I'm glad I fucked so many people that I didn't care about. That's, that's why

[<a id="00-49-17">00:49:17</a>]  it was so meaningful to me. I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't think that's going

[<a id="00-49-22">00:49:22</a>]  to happen. I think the last moment, you probably think all the people that meant meaningful

[<a id="00-49-28">00:49:28</a>]  to you and people that you love, you know, I mean, I haven't died yet, so I don't know,

[<a id="00-49-33">00:49:33</a>]  but I would imagine that, you know, so when my friends said to me, you're so lucky you

[<a id="00-49-37">00:49:37</a>]  get to travel those places and do that, it's scary living the way I do. You know, I don't

[<a id="00-49-41">00:49:41</a>]  have any sort of like, um, plan B or something bad happened. I'm kind of fucked. But, um,

[<a id="00-49-47">00:49:47</a>]  I tell my friends that nobody's keeping you away from that. You could travel the place

[<a id="00-49-51">00:49:51</a>]  if you want to, but they don't, you know, that's something meaningful. If you have something

[<a id="00-49-57">00:49:57</a>]  meaningful in your life, you always make time to do it. You know, so, um, so I think last

[<a id="00-50-03">00:50:03</a>]  minute of your life, I'm not gonna say like, yeah, I'm glad fuck hundred women or whatever.

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  I don't think so. Okay. You probably think about if you have a wife and a kids or grandkids,

[<a id="00-50-11">00:50:11</a>]  I think you think about them, how much you're going to miss them and how much they're going

[<a id="00-50-14">00:50:14</a>]  to miss you. Do you think your, uh, your time in the porn industry was meaningful to you

[<a id="00-50-22">00:50:22</a>]  and something that, you know, on your, on your left bed, something that you won't regret

[<a id="00-50-26">00:50:26</a>]  or be like, yeah, I think that was something I wanted to live my life for. I went in for

[<a id="00-50-33">00:50:33</a>]  wrong reasons, but, um, how did that happen? Actually, how did you get in? Like, um, did

[<a id="00-50-41">00:50:41</a>]  you know someone or there was all kinds of other things looking back, kind of leading

[<a id="00-50-46">00:50:46</a>]  to that direction, but, but the biggest one was like, I don't know, 96, 97, maybe 98.

[<a id="00-50-52">00:50:52</a>]  I have a friend in Tiananmen, a really funny guy from Washington state. He was working

[<a id="00-50-56">00:50:56</a>]  at the one of the porn shop and my family was suffering financially, you know, but Tana

[<a id="00-51-02">00:51:02</a>]  told me one time how much those shop makes. I didn't really believe that number was just

[<a id="00-51-06">00:51:06</a>]  too much because that shop is basically about this wide and like, uh, from there to maybe

[<a id="00-51-14">00:51:14</a>]  all the way to end. Okay. Maybe, maybe another 35, 40% further away, but that's the size

[<a id="00-51-19">00:51:19</a>]  of the shop. Not so big. Yeah. It was making millions of dollars because they had those,

[<a id="00-51-25">00:51:25</a>]  those booth where you put a quarter and watch their movies and people renting the movie

[<a id="00-51-29">00:51:29</a>]  and buying stuff. Oh shit. So it's like a, it's like a cinema where they can just watch

[<a id="00-51-34">00:51:34</a>]  it. Yeah. But we were also selling a lot of merchandise and making a lot of money, but,

[<a id="00-51-39">00:51:39</a>]  but the number that he gave me was so high. I didn't believe it, but so one time he stole

[<a id="00-51-43">00:51:43</a>]  a balance sheet, the bookkeeping department and he showed me and I just cannot believe

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  how much money they were making. So I thought maybe I could work in porn. I did okay in

[<a id="00-51-54">00:51:54</a>]  college that maybe I could work in porn and take care of my family. So that was the kind

[<a id="00-51-59">00:51:59</a>]  of idea when I got in and my first job was July of 1999. Nice year. And it's the same

[<a id="00-52-09">00:52:09</a>]  week when Stanley Kubrick's movie Ice White Shop premiered. And that movie have a lot

[<a id="00-52-14">00:52:14</a>]  of like conspiracy money, but pornographic stuff in there. So it was really strange.

[<a id="00-52-20">00:52:20</a>]  And this is beyond your time, before your time, but on the day, um, Ice White Shop premiered

[<a id="00-52-26">00:52:26</a>]  JFK Jr and his wife got killed in a plane accident. Oh, okay. Wow. Cause Ice White Shop

[<a id="00-52-31">00:52:31</a>]  is about marriage and love. And here is a perfect example of Kamala, the JFK's son

[<a id="00-52-40">00:52:40</a>]  getting killed in a plane accident, you know? Wow. So that was like the way I started and

[<a id="00-52-45">00:52:45</a>]  I went in, I went in for money. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Okay. I haven't watched the movie. Is

[<a id="00-52-52">00:52:52</a>]  it, is it something worth watching? It's one of the most meaningful, in my opinion, it's

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  the most meaningful movie to Kubrick because I think at the end of the day, it's about

[<a id="00-53-05">00:53:05</a>]  his tribute to his wife who he loved tremendously. And he was married three times and three times

[<a id="00-53-15">00:53:15</a>]  he was married. His three marriages are covered in three movies that he made. Uh, Barry London

[<a id="00-53-21">00:53:21</a>]  when he was young and was kind of, uh, maybe not as authentic. Second one, his most hated

[<a id="00-53-26">00:53:26</a>]  marriage, which was covered in a movie called The Shining where Jack Nicholson's character

[<a id="00-53-30">00:53:30</a>]  is trying to kill his wife. And third one is the marriage that he ended up with and

[<a id="00-53-35">00:53:35</a>]  it's the most meaningful one. So going back to the meaningful part, right? Um, I'm not

[<a id="00-53-40">00:53:40</a>]  very religious. So I, I used to make my religious people mad by saying, I thought life is pretty

[<a id="00-53-46">00:53:46</a>]  meaningless, right? But I changed my mind. Life is meaningless, but you, if you're lucky,

[<a id="00-53-53">00:53:53</a>]  you could give a meaning to it. Cause how do you explain sometimes people get killed

[<a id="00-53-57">00:53:57</a>]  when their baby, you can't say that that baby had a chance to have a meaningful life, right?

[<a id="00-54-02">00:54:02</a>]  So you can't have a meaningful life if you're a little lucky too, you know? Um, so work

[<a id="00-54-08">00:54:08</a>]  in the porn, you wouldn't think, but looking back, there's things that, uh, I was struggling

[<a id="00-54-13">00:54:13</a>]  with the business kind of exposed what that was and I had to deal with it. But I met plenty

[<a id="00-54-18">00:54:18</a>]  of decent people that, uh, I missed them tremendously. And, uh, that they, I learned when I started

[<a id="00-54-29">00:54:29</a>]  really well last night, it was disaster at the end, but even you have to met, there was

[<a id="00-54-33">00:54:33</a>]  a couple of story room go like, wow, right? Cause surprising, right? I had plenty of those

[<a id="00-54-39">00:54:39</a>]  wild moments where, um, they grow up without enough meaningful love. Maybe my family loved

[<a id="00-54-48">00:54:48</a>]  me, but they didn't know how to do it. And if you can't get love from your family, sometimes

[<a id="00-54-52">00:54:52</a>]  you have to go elsewhere, right? Yeah. And sadly, a lot of people go to porn mostly maybe

[<a id="00-54-58">00:54:58</a>]  for money and attention, but sometimes they come from really fucked up situation where

[<a id="00-55-04">00:55:04</a>]  that's the only option they have where they can have, they can find a family there. And

[<a id="00-55-09">00:55:09</a>]  if you saw Paul Thomas Anderson's movie, Boogie Night, it's really that it's like, it's, yes,

[<a id="00-55-13">00:55:13</a>]  it's a movie about porn, but it's, it's these broken people's home, you know? Yeah. Wow.

[<a id="00-55-20">00:55:20</a>]  Okay. That's something I should watch. Wow. So now, now this brings me to another question

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  because, okay, you said like people. Is this the first time you're doing podcasts? Yeah.

[<a id="00-55-31">00:55:31</a>]  You're doing pretty good. I mean, that's pretty damn, it's pretty damn good. You're not nervous.

[<a id="00-55-35">00:55:35</a>]  You're kind of like, you've been real, authentic. Started rough. Started rough. Like I'm trying

[<a id="00-55-41">00:55:41</a>]  to find like questions. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, this is beyond good. Um, I think you're

[<a id="00-55-48">00:55:48</a>]  natural at it, you know? Maybe I'll be Joe Rogan 2.0 or something. There we go. You know?

[<a id="00-55-53">00:55:53</a>]  Cause I think, um, I don't want to be one of those old guys that these fucking young

[<a id="00-55-58">00:55:58</a>]  kids don't know. I mean, sometime I do that, but, um, you, we don't do a good job connecting

[<a id="00-56-06">00:56:06</a>]  with you guys. And we only say it because we also want you guys to be successful and

[<a id="00-56-11">00:56:11</a>]  happy, you know? Because I think, um, ever since COVID when I did shows, um, I'll go

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  back to you, you know, you asked me a question, but it's very concerning when I do shows in

[<a id="00-56-20">00:56:20</a>]  states, I sometimes ask the people in the audience, Hey, for those of you, for those

[<a id="00-56-25">00:56:25</a>]  of you with kids, are you optimistic about your kid's future? It's like 80% of the time

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  they're not optimistic at all. That's really, really scary. Yeah. And sad actually. Like,

[<a id="00-56-38">00:56:38</a>]  I don't know, like, do you think people aren't involved enough with, like, if I, if I, uh,

[<a id="00-56-46">00:56:46</a>]  you know, look at, look at people around me, like, I don't think a lot of people my age

[<a id="00-56-52">00:56:52</a>]  have a, have a meaningful connection with their parents. Like, it's like, I don't know.

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  So I think some people think, sometimes I think it's frowned upon that. My dad got me

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  into comedy. It's showing me stuff, you know, which is, which is who, who think that's bad?

[<a id="00-57-11">00:57:11</a>]  Who, you know, I don't, I didn't, I don't have a particular person that said, yeah,

[<a id="00-57-19">00:57:19</a>]  um, this is bad. He shouldn't be doing this. Yeah. But you know, no, no, no, never. But

[<a id="00-57-24">00:57:24</a>]  you know, yeah, I get that feeling. Yeah. You know, okay. Best example is my dad started

[<a id="00-57-30">00:57:30</a>]  smoking again after a while and you know, yeah, he used to not smoke. Then he started

[<a id="00-57-36">00:57:36</a>]  again and uh, then I was like, you know, fuck it. Yeah, I'm going to do it too because everybody

[<a id="00-57-41">00:57:41</a>]  was smoking around. Um, that's my excuse. Yeah. But uh, no, then he started giving me

[<a id="00-57-48">00:57:48</a>]  secrets and uh, kind of, he was feeding my addiction, but also, you know, we talked,

[<a id="00-57-54">00:57:54</a>]  we talked a lot about drugs and very openly and he talked to me like I was not his son.

[<a id="00-57-59">00:57:59</a>]  Yeah. He didn't talk down to me. Um, and I don't think this is a normal thing. Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-06">00:58:06</a>]  Yeah. That's, that's crazy. Like, I don't think a lot of people my age have had this

[<a id="00-58-11">00:58:11</a>]  connection with their parents. No. I mean like I see, you know, sometimes the guys in

[<a id="00-58-17">00:58:17</a>]  school, they tell me how their parents talk to them and uh, do they talk to them or do

[<a id="00-58-22">00:58:22</a>]  they talk at them? I think at them. Yeah. That's different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like,

[<a id="00-58-30">00:58:30</a>]  like to a certain extent they try to control. Yeah. But um, the thing is I think they realize

[<a id="00-58-38">00:58:38</a>]  they can't control everything. And then, uh, the, this like the house, the safe spot, the,

[<a id="00-58-47">00:58:47</a>]  the place the kid grew up in suddenly doesn't feel safe anymore. Yeah. Um, without the kids

[<a id="00-58-53">00:58:53</a>]  knowing, yeah, this is a place I can come back to, but it doesn't feel like I want to

[<a id="00-58-58">00:58:58</a>]  because I can't, I can't smoke a cigarette. Yeah. For example, like I have, I have this

[<a id="00-59-04">00:59:04</a>]  need to smoke and I can't live out at home. So why the fuck should I go back? And this

[<a id="00-59-10">00:59:10</a>]  is a big thing. Like the big problem, I think nowadays, like, yeah, like my dad, he, he

[<a id="00-59-17">00:59:17</a>]  also gave me alcohol, but you know, there's two sides of the blade, you know, because

[<a id="00-59-23">00:59:23</a>]  on the one side it's really fucked up of him doing this. Yeah. And this is, this is what

[<a id="00-59-28">00:59:28</a>]  I see, um, what other people see mostly like the outside. This is the first perspective,

[<a id="00-59-34">00:59:34</a>]  but the second perspective is I'm getting a view on things that, um, that I would, I

[<a id="00-59-41">00:59:41</a>]  would get a lot later in my life. Yeah. Um, I think this is, this can help me in a way,

[<a id="00-59-49">00:59:49</a>]  you know, it's maybe it's not for everyone, you know, but sorry, I'm going to keep repeating

[<a id="00-59-54">00:59:54</a>]  myself because I know that show that I said, um, I didn't end bro. Um, the name of the

[<a id="00-59-59">00:59:59</a>]  show was adult content, right? Yeah. And when I was a kid, I missed on this too. I thought,

[<a id="01-00-03">01:00:03</a>]  I really thought it meant adult content, like adult happiness, right? And ultimately, ultimately

[<a id="01-00-10">01:00:10</a>]  when I tell that story in Enbro about porn stories, but ultimately it was kind of like

[<a id="01-00-15">01:00:15</a>]  leading to stories where I tell at the end of the story, you know, cause happiness really

[<a id="01-00-19">01:00:19</a>]  does matter. It's very elusive at time, you know, but, um, so talking to your dad, it's

[<a id="01-00-25">01:00:25</a>]  been fun because no matter how much goofy shit he does, and it is fun and we do show

[<a id="01-00-31">01:00:31</a>]  is goofy, but every single night, uh, once or twice, for sure. He say every single night,

[<a id="01-00-38">01:00:38</a>]  I don't care what happened to me, but if, you know, if something happened to my kids,

[<a id="01-00-42">01:00:42</a>]  I don't give a fuck. I'll kill those people, you know, cause at the end of the day, you,

[<a id="01-00-49">01:00:49</a>]  you know, what's the most important and he loved comedy going or whatever, and goof around

[<a id="01-00-53">01:00:53</a>]  with women or whatever, but number one priority is to you guys. Number two priority to you

[<a id="01-00-59">01:00:59</a>]  guys. Number three priority to you guys, you know, and I think when you get older, uh,

[<a id="01-01-06">01:01:06</a>]  you will understand that, but I always tell my friends' kids the tragedy these days with

[<a id="01-01-12">01:01:12</a>]  the parents and kids, cause when I do comedy, you're a risk development cause you don't

[<a id="01-01-17">01:01:17</a>]  act your age. You still think you're young because of being stupid doing comedy, but

[<a id="01-01-22">01:01:22</a>]  then the thing that makes me sad when I, uh, I live long enough, you know, um, by the time

[<a id="01-01-27">01:01:27</a>]  you really, really, really, really, truly understand how much your dad loved you, you

[<a id="01-01-33">01:01:33</a>]  and your sister and all the things that he's doing that you don't notice, all the invisible

[<a id="01-01-38">01:01:38</a>]  things behind your back he was doing, by the time that you really, truly understand and

[<a id="01-01-42">01:01:42</a>]  then appreciate it, uh, he'll be dead then. This is a sad tragedy, you know, and, um,

[<a id="01-01-49">01:01:49</a>]  I don't want, I want you to realize that, but some things just, it's not that obvious

[<a id="01-01-53">01:01:53</a>]  sometimes, you know, because I think your generation in some way is far worse than mine,

[<a id="01-01-58">01:01:58</a>]  you know, cause, um, um, there's a thing in Japan called Ijime. Ijime is like bullying,

[<a id="01-02-06">01:02:06</a>]  picking on kids, but it's really vicious, Japanese version, you know. In fact, first

[<a id="01-02-11">01:02:11</a>]  or second week of September when school starts, um, it's one of the dangerous times because

[<a id="01-02-15">01:02:15</a>]  these kids are so afraid going back and getting treated again, they kill themselves, you know.

[<a id="01-02-20">01:02:20</a>]  Oh, wow. I was one of those kids that got picked on, you know, and, uh, eventually, uh,

[<a id="01-02-25">01:02:25</a>]  it's a long story. I mentioned this before, but somebody trained me and ready to deal

[<a id="01-02-30">01:02:30</a>]  with it violently, which is not good looking back, but, uh, I did something to one of the

[<a id="01-02-36">01:02:36</a>]  kids when four or five of them beat me up every single day. Oh, wow. It stopped. That's

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  how you deal with old days because none of the authorities will help you. Well, these

[<a id="01-02-46">01:02:46</a>]  days is terrible with Ijime because even if you decide not to go to school, they're attacking

[<a id="01-02-51">01:02:51</a>]  you by social media. Yeah. See, they didn't have them when I was a kid. If I decide not

[<a id="01-02-55">01:02:55</a>]  to go to school, at least I have that day protection, right? You guys have no protection

[<a id="01-03-00">01:03:00</a>]  24/7. Yeah. I think, I think Harry even has a joke about it. Sorry, sorry. 24/7. I said

[<a id="01-03-06">01:03:06</a>]  24/7. 24/7. So you don't have a protection, you know what I mean? Yeah. And, and, and

[<a id="01-03-11">01:03:11</a>]  what happened? I experienced this, you know, like, you know, I've, I've, I've been bullied,

[<a id="01-03-16">01:03:16</a>]  but I also bullied. Yeah. So you fight back. Yeah. Yeah. I, I see that a little bit of

[<a id="01-03-22">01:03:22</a>]  feistiness that, that, that, that, that from your dad, you know? Yeah. He's a nice guy,

[<a id="01-03-27">01:03:27</a>]  but you know, you could push somebody for so long, you know? Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

[<a id="01-03-31">01:03:31</a>]  Like I'm a cool guy, you know, and I'll, I'll say like, I'll avoid a fight, but if it comes

[<a id="01-03-38">01:03:38</a>]  to it, you know, I'm fine. Yeah. I'll step into it. But, but the thing is, well, I realized

[<a id="01-03-45">01:03:45</a>]  with, you know, back in sixth grade, I was, I was bullied basically so hard and I didn't

[<a id="01-03-51">01:03:51</a>]  enjoy school so much that, well, I wasn't like, I was bullied and I was, I did bully.

[<a id="01-04-00">01:04:00</a>]  So it was a mix of things, but I just, I just didn't want to go to school so hard. So I

[<a id="01-04-05">01:04:05</a>]  got sent to Germany. I talked about that before, three months, but in that time I spent a lot

[<a id="01-04-11">01:04:11</a>]  of time on my phone as well. And I still, I'm still in contact with people in Switzerland.

[<a id="01-04-18">01:04:18</a>]  So there's this kid called Kevin and he's just, he's just a bully. Yeah. Just being

[<a id="01-04-24">01:04:24</a>]  bullied because of his name. Like I'm sorry for every Kevin out there. Just Kevin is such

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  a shit name nowadays. I'm telling you man, like that mom did not love this kid. No, I'm

[<a id="01-04-37">01:04:37</a>]  kidding. Like he's a cool guy. I've seen him again. And he's not like that anymore, right?

[<a id="01-04-42">01:04:42</a>]  No, he's like, so crazy thing is he was really insecure back then. Like he had a big nose

[<a id="01-04-49">01:04:49</a>]  and we made fun of his nose about his name and the crazy thing is we didn't do as much

[<a id="01-04-57">01:04:57</a>]  in school. Yeah. I still did it, but less. And he, he did fight back. Yeah. So he had

[<a id="01-05-05">01:05:05</a>]  a chance. But I, I was such a fucking asshole over chat man. Cause I was so bored. I had

[<a id="01-05-14">01:05:14</a>]  nothing to do. Yeah. Except bully this kid basically and watch porn. So sometimes I can

[<a id="01-05-20">01:05:20</a>]  tell the difference. What's worse, getting picked on or picking on somebody because yeah,

[<a id="01-05-27">01:05:27</a>]  getting picked on is not fun, but when you pick somebody, it does, it does something

[<a id="01-05-31">01:05:31</a>]  to you too, because being a dick and asshole, it can be really good for your soul either.

[<a id="01-05-35">01:05:35</a>]  You know what I mean? Yeah. Looking back like, fuck, why did I do that? You know? And uh,

[<a id="01-05-40">01:05:40</a>]  I think, I think there's a lot of bullies, you know, nowadays I think you hear mainstream

[<a id="01-05-47">01:05:47</a>]  people killing themselves actually. Yeah. Things they have done that they can't get

[<a id="01-05-52">01:05:52</a>]  rid of them. Yeah. You know? Uh, yeah, I don't like this, this social media bullying is a,

[<a id="01-05-57">01:05:57</a>]  it's a big problem, you know? And that's why, you know, it's, it's so important to, to still

[<a id="01-06-04">01:06:04</a>]  even though in this day and age, you like, you have more online. So important to train

[<a id="01-06-10">01:06:10</a>]  martial arts. Mostly in this day and age, it gives you, it gives you such a confidence.

[<a id="01-06-16">01:06:16</a>]  Yeah. And I think it seems like, because I know Joel Rogan for a while, I mean, I'm not

[<a id="01-06-21">01:06:21</a>]  a close friend or anything, but I think, uh, it's not like it gives you a sense of peace

[<a id="01-06-26">01:06:26</a>]  because you know how to handle yourself. But after that, you, you're surprisingly a lot

[<a id="01-06-31">01:06:31</a>]  of this, uh, mixed martial art and, uh, uh, UFC, they're killers, right? What a sweet,

[<a id="01-06-36">01:06:36</a>]  wonderful people. Cause they know they could handle any situation. There's not, look, if

[<a id="01-06-40">01:06:40</a>]  you're a Lamborghini, you have nothing to prove in freeway, right? If Toyota car, you

[<a id="01-06-44">01:06:44</a>]  know what I mean? Like they're fucking with you, but like, well, you don't have to do

[<a id="01-06-47">01:06:47</a>]  anything to prove that, you know, you're a killer, you know, you're a killer car. So

[<a id="01-06-51">01:06:51</a>]  there's peace at that. But even, but even then, I think being comfortable with yourself

[<a id="01-06-57">01:06:57</a>]  and doing what you think is right, being authentic is important, you know? But, but, um, going

[<a id="01-07-03">01:07:03</a>]  back to, um, what I was saying about you guys, I think the reason why it's so difficult for

[<a id="01-07-07">01:07:07</a>]  you guys, because when I was your age, we didn't have cell phone, social media. We were

[<a id="01-07-11">01:07:11</a>]  just fucking bored. Yeah. Right. We were just fucking bored. We had nothing to do. And every

[<a id="01-07-16">01:07:16</a>]  time I said bored, one of my relatives would just hit me in the back of the head like,

[<a id="01-07-19">01:07:19</a>]  well, go to the library, read something. Oh, okay. Well, let me give you a word. I'm going

[<a id="01-07-23">01:07:23</a>]  to, you know, they'll force you to do something. Even if you're bored, you could always find

[<a id="01-07-30">01:07:30</a>]  something to do. Well, your generation replaced boredom with anxiety. Yeah. Because having

[<a id="01-07-37">01:07:37</a>]  access to so much information, there's no mystery. It's kind of nice to say like, Oh,

[<a id="01-07-42">01:07:42</a>]  I wonder why the sky's blue. I have no idea. So you just move on with your dumb friends,

[<a id="01-07-47">01:07:47</a>]  but you have answers to too many things. Like there's nothing mysterious about it on top

[<a id="01-07-52">01:07:52</a>]  of it. Uh, this is what I told your dad about that. You guys, maybe even, even if you're

[<a id="01-07-57">01:07:57</a>]  not religious, you know, one particular religion, I call it, um, I call it Judaism. And the

[<a id="01-08-05">01:08:05</a>]  reason why I said Judaism, because one of the main, main religion in my opinion for

[<a id="01-08-13">01:08:13</a>]  Jewish people is psychoanalysis. Oh, okay. Sigmund Freud, Woody Allen, people like that.

[<a id="01-08-20">01:08:20</a>]  And when you're that sophisticated, you know, too much stuff about psychology, you constantly

[<a id="01-08-24">01:08:24</a>]  keep reminding yourself PTSD trigger, but you're too focused on all the things that

[<a id="01-08-31">01:08:31</a>]  could go wrong. You're too focused on being nervous, you know, because when I was your

[<a id="01-08-36">01:08:36</a>]  age, we're too stupid. We didn't even know what those things were. Yeah. And if I said,

[<a id="01-08-41">01:08:41</a>]  I feel sad, then they hit me back in the head and say, well, here's, let me give you a reason

[<a id="01-08-45">01:08:45</a>]  to be sad or I don't get, stop picking on me. But you know what I mean? It's like sometimes

[<a id="01-08-49">01:08:49</a>]  overthinking it hurts you. Yeah. And, and, and also other people when you don't think

[<a id="01-08-54">01:08:54</a>]  about anything either, but you guys have a problem, but I don't think you have as problem

[<a id="01-09-00">01:09:00</a>]  as much as you think you, you have, you have problem, but you, I think you're like over

[<a id="01-09-05">01:09:05</a>]  dramatic sense. You know, you have, you, I think you guys think you have 10 times more

[<a id="01-09-09">01:09:09</a>]  than the problem that you actually have. And this anxiety is not a good cause. I didn't

[<a id="01-09-13">01:09:13</a>]  really grow up with anxiety. We were bored and stupid. Yeah. So, so that's a, does that

[<a id="01-09-18">01:09:18</a>]  make sense? Yeah, totally. So I'm, I'm thinking, first of all, anxiety and insecurity is very

[<a id="01-09-25">01:09:25</a>]  close. Yeah. Maybe there's a synonym. Can you give me something? I have plenty of insecurity

[<a id="01-09-32">01:09:32</a>]  and who doesn't have that? Yeah, totally. And I'm wondering like, okay. I think a lot

[<a id="01-09-38">01:09:38</a>]  of it, you know, comes, okay. First of all, looks so many people are obsessed with looks.

[<a id="01-09-45">01:09:45</a>]  This is definitely a factor of insecurity. Weirdly porn changed my attitude about that,

[<a id="01-09-51">01:09:51</a>]  but go ahead. Oh, okay. So that's, that's what I'm wondering because I think porn gives,

[<a id="01-09-57">01:09:57</a>]  gives an insecurity about, yeah. Yeah. Because unrealistic standards, like also shit, my

[<a id="01-10-03">01:10:03</a>]  penis isn't that big, you know, what the fuck am I going to do that? That was such a lot

[<a id="01-10-08">01:10:08</a>]  like, that was a hard thought for me because that's all these big ass penises. Um, I thought

[<a id="01-10-14">01:10:14</a>]  I could never make a woman come. Do you like fish? Yeah, I like fish, but not stinky fish.

[<a id="01-10-19">01:10:19</a>]  Uh, you know, those Flanders, you know, those flat fish that I got together, they're ugly

[<a id="01-10-23">01:10:23</a>]  fish. They're ugly, right? Fucking delicious. Um, dolphins, beautiful fish, a beautiful,

[<a id="01-10-32">01:10:32</a>]  beautiful sea creature. Beautiful. Uh, not delicious. Why do you know this dude? I'm

[<a id="01-10-38">01:10:38</a>]  from Japan. Now, sometimes people cut up on like prettiness because I think when I work

[<a id="01-10-45">01:10:45</a>]  in porn, what really, I watch so much porn, you know what I did when I hang out with them?

[<a id="01-10-50">01:10:50</a>]  What I did was, uh, all of a sudden I'm not interested in what the woman looks like. I'm

[<a id="01-10-55">01:10:55</a>]  interested in what she's capable, what she is capable with her body. Yeah. Right? Like

[<a id="01-11-01">01:11:01</a>]  she doesn't have that perfect body or perfect face because I've seen plenty of girls, beautiful

[<a id="01-11-06">01:11:06</a>]  girls who don't want to do porn, but they're doing it for money. I don't even want to watch

[<a id="01-11-09">01:11:09</a>]  that shit. Like it's clearly she's not into it. I'm not into that shit, but I'd rather

[<a id="01-11-15">01:11:15</a>]  have ugly girl with like unbelievable sexual move and appetite. That seemed amazing. So

[<a id="01-11-21">01:11:21</a>]  weirdly porn may be like not concerned with what the girl looks like. Does that make sense?

[<a id="01-11-26">01:11:26</a>]  Yeah. Like I'd rather have ugly face that tastes well than the pretty face that looks,

[<a id="01-11-31">01:11:31</a>]  tastes really awful. That's, that's totally true. You know, that's, this is a thing. Sometimes

[<a id="01-11-36">01:11:36</a>]  personality matters more than the girl's look. I'd rather have like above average looking

[<a id="01-11-42">01:11:42</a>]  girl with like amazing personality than Victoria's Secret models. Yeah, they're beautiful. Like,

[<a id="01-11-48">01:11:48</a>]  but if they have shit personality, they get the fuck out of here, you know? Yeah. That's

[<a id="01-11-52">01:11:52</a>]  fucked up because you know, I had this, I had this, uh, girl I was seeing like from

[<a id="01-11-57">01:11:57</a>]  school and dude, she's like, I'd say 8 out of 10, 10 out of 10. Dude, she had no fucking

[<a id="01-12-06">01:12:06</a>]  personality. It was just fucking boring with her. But yeah, I totally get what you mean.

[<a id="01-12-11">01:12:11</a>]  She's also a victim too because when they're pretty, that's all the value they see in her.

[<a id="01-12-16">01:12:16</a>]  And then she didn't have to work on personality cause they didn't, they weren't expecting

[<a id="01-12-18">01:12:18</a>]  it. They just want her prettiness and that's it. True, true. That's, that's why Harry gets

[<a id="01-12-23">01:12:23</a>]  so many attractive, like he tells me he does and he shows me on Instagram. Because he's

[<a id="01-12-28">01:12:28</a>]  an old guy and you know, he doesn't, he doesn't give a fuck how you look. You know, he's like,

[<a id="01-12-35">01:12:35</a>]  because he has this thing, he sees through the looks. It's also numbers game too. Yeah.

[<a id="01-12-42">01:12:42</a>]  You think? Yeah, because he gives less of a shit, no? Yeah. Yeah. I think he, I understand

[<a id="01-12-48">01:12:48</a>]  why he does it. I also understand like why it doesn't bother him because when you do

[<a id="01-12-52">01:12:52</a>]  stand up, you bomb all the time. You got used to rejection. Like when you, when you do a

[<a id="01-12-56">01:12:56</a>]  show with 300 people, they hated you, you got 300 rejection. So why do you care about

[<a id="01-13-00">01:13:00</a>]  one dumb girl that they like you? You know what I mean? Yeah, totally. It's almost like

[<a id="01-13-04">01:13:04</a>]  Matrix, like Neo. He just fought 300. Why, why is he going to worry about fighting one

[<a id="01-13-10">01:13:10</a>]  person? Do you know what I mean? Yeah, definitely. Rejection is such a like painful and terrible

[<a id="01-13-15">01:13:15</a>]  thing, but more you face it, you probably have a better life because you, you, you get,

[<a id="01-13-24">01:13:24</a>]  you're not afraid for a bigger challenge in life, you know? Yeah, totally. Like I think,

[<a id="01-13-30">01:13:30</a>]  I think it's a good thing, but it's a desensitizing, no? Rejection? Yeah, you're desensitizing yourself

[<a id="01-13-38">01:13:38</a>]  to, to, to situations. Not for me. I think, you know. What I'm scared of is. Don't be.

[<a id="01-13-51">01:13:51</a>]  I think I should. I think I should because, you know. I'm not saying, I'm not saying reckless

[<a id="01-13-57">01:13:57</a>]  and crazy, but every time you want to do something different or ask somebody you're scared, that

[<a id="01-14-03">01:14:03</a>]  fear is prevent you from going to a better place and even you get rejection, it's a numbers

[<a id="01-14-09">01:14:09</a>]  game too, but like I have so many friends that they're afraid to go overseas, you know?

[<a id="01-14-14">01:14:14</a>]  Like I've been to 70 places, whatever, but you know, every time you do something new,

[<a id="01-14-19">01:14:19</a>]  you face fear, but that's the fun thing. When you, when you know there's fear, you do it

[<a id="01-14-25">01:14:25</a>]  anyway, you know? And that's a, that's a true thing. I, I get where you're coming from.

[<a id="01-14-31">01:14:31</a>]  But like there's certain, I think, like anxiety, maybe, but there's certain connection with

[<a id="01-14-40">01:14:40</a>]  two people where sometimes I wish I wouldn't have said something. Yeah, we all make mistakes.

[<a id="01-14-46">01:14:46</a>]  Yeah. Or sometimes I think it's better if I just don't say this. Like a really simple

[<a id="01-14-52">01:14:52</a>]  example is give a scenario. You, you, you're, you got a girlfriend since five years, whatever.

[<a id="01-15-03">01:15:03</a>]  You're thinking about marrying this girl. Yeah. But you fucked up. You drank, you drank

[<a id="01-15-07">01:15:07</a>]  a lot with your boys. Yeah. Went out, drank. There was this pretty girl. Yeah. You fucked

[<a id="01-15-13">01:15:13</a>]  her and you regret the shit out of it. Yeah. And this is the thing I think a lot of guys

[<a id="01-15-19">01:15:19</a>]  would tell, tell her. I just think that's selfish to do that, to say that to her. It's

[<a id="01-15-27">01:15:27</a>]  not fair to her. Yeah. I mean, I don't know, maybe I'm a scumbag, but if you really mean,

[<a id="01-15-34">01:15:34</a>]  if you really love her and you want to have her in your life and you're pretty sure you're

[<a id="01-15-41">01:15:41</a>]  not going to do it again, I don't think it's fair for her to ruin the thing you have, you

[<a id="01-15-46">01:15:46</a>]  know? But I mean, I don't know, maybe feminists would say I'm a scumbag, whatever, but I,

[<a id="01-15-50">01:15:50</a>]  I don't think, I think, I don't think that's fair to her. Yeah. Unless, unless your body

[<a id="01-15-55">01:15:55</a>]  said like, dude, you're going to cheat again. That's who you are. Then you gotta, then you

[<a id="01-16-00">01:16:00</a>]  gotta be honest to yourself. Like if you're, if you're like a perpetual cheater, then you

[<a id="01-16-06">01:16:06</a>]  gotta let her go. That's not fair to her. But if you're not that guy and if you know

[<a id="01-16-09">01:16:09</a>]  for yourself, you know, Socrates famously said, know thyself. So if you know yourself,

[<a id="01-16-16">01:16:16</a>]  it's like, this isn't like, like one of those weirdly weird thing that you did once, but

[<a id="01-16-19">01:16:19</a>]  it's not you. I think it's not fair to her. Yeah. That's what I think. Yeah. That's, that's

[<a id="01-16-24">01:16:24</a>]  totally fair point. I get that. Um, yeah. Are you happy? That's a, that's a valid question.

[<a id="01-16-32">01:16:32</a>]  That's a good question. Cause you know, nowadays. Usually if you have to think about it, probably

[<a id="01-16-39">01:16:39</a>]  not. It's hard. It's hard, right? It's very elusive. Yeah. Like, so let me tell you this.

[<a id="01-16-49">01:16:49</a>]  My sister is a, uh, she, she got into meditation a lot. Yeah. Um, Harry has done a meditation

[<a id="01-16-58">01:16:58</a>]  course as well in India and me and my sister, we went actually this year, like two, two,

[<a id="01-17-03">01:17:03</a>]  three weeks ago to this ashram it's called. Yeah. Um, you know what ashram is now? No,

[<a id="01-17-09">01:17:09</a>]  I don't know. It's one of the Indian religion or something or it's like a temple. Okay.

[<a id="01-17-13">01:17:13</a>]  Yeah. And there was like a hotel place we could stay there. Yeah. Just, just a really

[<a id="01-17-18">01:17:18</a>]  beautiful experience on, um, reading, reading, uh, things, uh, uh, of this yogi, this yogi

[<a id="01-17-25">01:17:25</a>]  is called Sadhguru. Yeah. He, um, he says, if you're a joyful inside, you know, you can

[<a id="01-17-33">01:17:33</a>]  be in every situation and, and still be happy, like joyful inside. Yeah. Doesn't, doesn't

[<a id="01-17-39">01:17:39</a>]  matter if you're enslaved doing something that, that is so physically endorsing something

[<a id="01-17-47">01:17:47</a>]  that you hate. Yeah. If you feel joy inside, you know, that, that situation doesn't matter

[<a id="01-17-54">01:17:54</a>]  to you because you're everything or something like this. This is my words now. This is not

[<a id="01-17-58">01:17:58</a>]  his words. Yeah. Um, but, um, you know, working in my job, there's shitty fucking days. I

[<a id="01-18-05">01:18:05</a>]  gotta say. Yeah. These days where I'm just like, what the fuck am I doing? I don't want

[<a id="01-18-08">01:18:08</a>]  to be doing this my whole life, man. I like, I want to travel. Yes. I want to see the world.

[<a id="01-18-13">01:18:13</a>]  I want to see what the fuck do I actually want to do in this? I don't, it doesn't. Highly

[<a id="01-18-18">01:18:18</a>]  recommend it. Yeah. I mean, I'm a fanatic of it. Highly recommend it. It will change

[<a id="01-18-23">01:18:23</a>]  you and then, and then, and then most likely the world will be better off because you go

[<a id="01-18-28">01:18:28</a>]  and you will be a representative for Switzerland and the West, you know, and I think it will

[<a id="01-18-33">01:18:33</a>]  change you because even when things are not going bad and I was really scared, you know,

[<a id="01-18-39">01:18:39</a>]  a few times, if you calm down, you will figure things out. But travel is just incredible.

[<a id="01-18-45">01:18:45</a>]  And I feel so bad for people that have no affinity for even for a little bit of travel,

[<a id="01-18-50">01:18:50</a>]  you know? Yeah. Like that's, that's beautifully. So how do you recommend traveling? Like what,

[<a id="01-18-56">01:18:56</a>]  what is, how did you start? How low budget, big budget, which where, where did you go?

[<a id="01-19-04">01:19:04</a>]  Where would you recommend, you know, for, for also a young guy, you know, cause I want

[<a id="01-19-08">01:19:08</a>]  to see people, I want to see culture. I also, you know, I'm okay with some danger, but I

[<a id="01-19-13">01:19:13</a>]  don't want to be. Yeah. Like, you know, like me like going Afghanistan three times or Israel

[<a id="01-19-20">01:19:20</a>]  or I'm going back to Ukraine again, you know, but if you do homework, you know, they're

[<a id="01-19-24">01:19:24</a>]  manageable, you know, it's hard for me to answer because you're European and you're already

[<a id="01-19-30">01:19:30</a>]  a worldly compared to Americans. But what I usually recommend any Americans to me, it

[<a id="01-19-35">01:19:35</a>]  doesn't matter what they're white, black, Asian, whatever. But if you're American, if

[<a id="01-19-39">01:19:39</a>]  you're American let's say they're in one of my white friend, friend's kid, seven, 18 years

[<a id="01-19-48">01:19:48</a>]  old, like yourself, but they're from the United States. Yeah. And if they only speak one language,

[<a id="01-19-52">01:19:52</a>]  English and they've never been overseas, I highly recommend like maybe one quick trip

[<a id="01-19-57">01:19:57</a>]  where this is something with Rick Steves, one of my favorite budget, European travel

[<a id="01-20-02">01:20:02</a>]  guy, a guru, just one of the most important person in my life. He said, you don't have

[<a id="01-20-09">01:20:09</a>]  to spend million dollars to have million dollar experience. So you need to go, but if you're

[<a id="01-20-13">01:20:13</a>]  going first time, you don't speak any other language in American, I would say this quick,

[<a id="01-20-17">01:20:17</a>]  like seven, 10 to 14 day trip where you go London because you're flying to another country,

[<a id="01-20-24">01:20:24</a>]  but they speak English and Paris and Amsterdam and back. Cause I think those three places

[<a id="01-20-29">01:20:29</a>]  does a pretty good introduction. Paris, you know, maybe they don't, they'll pretend like

[<a id="01-20-33">01:20:33</a>]  they don't speak English, but you know, just the fact that drugs and prostitution is legal

[<a id="01-20-38">01:20:38</a>]  in Amsterdam. Oh wow, I didn't know that. That's great. Drugs aren't new. And that's

[<a id="01-20-43">01:20:43</a>]  a good introduction that there's alternative way of living. Netherlands also help United

[<a id="01-20-51">01:20:51</a>]  States when we send John Adams, our second president and future second president ambassador

[<a id="01-20-56">01:20:56</a>]  to Netherlands asking for money financing war against England. Paris, you know, just

[<a id="01-21-03">01:21:03</a>]  a beauty and museum, things like that. England, our country who, you're still in the United

[<a id="01-21-08">01:21:08</a>]  States. So that's a good introduction. Then after that, once that trip is done, how you

[<a id="01-21-13">01:21:13</a>]  highly recommend other places in Europe. But once you get comfortable traveling in most

[<a id="01-21-17">01:21:17</a>]  of the Europe, then I go to another level where they should travel to Asia, central

[<a id="01-21-22">01:21:22</a>]  Asia, middle East and Africa and places like that, you know, but how'd you get to Afghanistan?

[<a id="01-21-28">01:21:28</a>]  I was at 2012, 2013 and 2019. There's a comedian named Ari Shaffir, a really funny comedian.

[<a id="01-21-39">01:21:39</a>]  I've heard of him. Yeah. We were talking 27, we were thinking about going to Iran and while

[<a id="01-21-43">01:21:43</a>]  we were having lunch, talking about Iran, Trump passed a travel restrictions. You can't

[<a id="01-21-47">01:21:47</a>]  do that anymore. But I would like to go to Iran. I'd like to go to North Korea. My friend

[<a id="01-21-52">01:21:52</a>]  Joe, he was translator for Dennis Rodman when he went to North Korea and they were hanging

[<a id="01-21-56">01:21:56</a>]  out with Kim Jong-un. So Joe, he's a white guy, but he was doing translation in Korean

[<a id="01-22-01">01:22:01</a>]  for Dennis Rodman. So when he traveled to really weird, odd things like show business,

[<a id="01-22-07">01:22:07</a>]  you meet a lot of interesting people like that. And this is what I love because I grew

[<a id="01-22-10">01:22:10</a>]  up in Japan where everyone looks same, everybody thinks same, they live the same way. But man,

[<a id="01-22-16">01:22:16</a>]  I remember as a kid watching Star Wars the first time when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan

[<a id="01-22-20">01:22:20</a>]  Kenobi went to that bar and everybody looked weird and fucked up. I love that shit. I just

[<a id="01-22-25">01:22:25</a>]  like everyone weird. I love taking number seven train from Manhattan to Queens because

[<a id="01-22-34">01:22:34</a>]  when I'm taking number seven train, you see, you know, Puerto Rican mom with six kids, black

[<a id="01-22-38">01:22:38</a>]  mama five, you have a punker, you have a business guy, you have Asian guy, Middle Eastern guy,

[<a id="01-22-43">01:22:43</a>]  a guy with AIDS, a homosexual, you have transgender person, you see a midget, you have rowdy fans,

[<a id="01-22-51">01:22:51</a>]  people who hate sports, people reading a book, people who hate it. It's just so crazy. And

[<a id="01-22-58">01:22:58</a>]  I was in Japan about a month ago for two weeks, clean, cheap, the food was great. Everyone's

[<a id="01-23-05">01:23:05</a>]  respectful. Nobody talking the train. The quality service unimaginable. But here's the

[<a id="01-23-11">01:23:11</a>]  weird thing, as soon as I got back in America taking public subway, a black guy showing

[<a id="01-23-17">01:23:17</a>]  me his dick, screaming, you know, yelling, punching, calling you a faggot, just racial

[<a id="01-23-23">01:23:23</a>]  thing like, "Oh my God, I miss my home." Because as crazy as it is, this is what I love about

[<a id="01-23-29">01:23:29</a>]  that place, you know? Even with all the problems that we have in America, America is the land

[<a id="01-23-37">01:23:37</a>]  of giant, giant idiot, giant geniuses. You see the most beautiful people. You see the

[<a id="01-23-43">01:23:43</a>]  ugliest people you ever met. It is the land of contradiction. But there's a reason why

[<a id="01-23-50">01:23:50</a>]  even my state of California has influenced the rest of the world, right? We have Hollywood

[<a id="01-23-54">01:23:54</a>]  in the south. You go up north in Silicon Valley with social media and high-tech. We have the

[<a id="01-23-59">01:23:59</a>]  biggest farming community. We have some of the most innovative laws created. It's a...

[<a id="01-24-06">01:24:06</a>]  Innovative with the hand thing. Yes. We have international trade gateway to Asia and Latin

[<a id="01-24-13">01:24:13</a>]  America. So as crazy as we have, crazy thing we do, we have a school shooting, we have

[<a id="01-24-19">01:24:19</a>]  serial killings, we have just crazy shit happen ton of time. But other hand, just like in

[<a id="01-24-24">01:24:24</a>]  a ledger, there's a balance. You meet some of the most amazing people that you'll maybe

[<a id="01-24-29">01:24:29</a>]  meet anywhere else. Wow. It's a land where people from all over the world risk their

[<a id="01-24-34">01:24:34</a>]  life to go to America, you know? Yeah, totally. Hypomania, they call it. I don't know exactly

[<a id="01-24-41">01:24:41</a>]  the definition. Bill Clinton has it. These are the people who have boundless energy.

[<a id="01-24-46">01:24:46</a>]  They're so curious. They can't sit still in a room. They have to go. They study that Native

[<a id="01-24-52">01:24:52</a>]  Americans with the biggest territory had a higher rate of hypomania. So anyone who risked

[<a id="01-24-57">01:24:57</a>]  their life from Europe to Asia to Latin America to go to America, back in those days when

[<a id="01-25-03">01:25:03</a>]  they showed up 100 years ago, that hypomania, just this mania that led them, this craziness,

[<a id="01-25-09">01:25:09</a>]  they're just adventurers, you know? Yeah. Americans are descendant of those kinds of

[<a id="01-25-13">01:25:13</a>]  people. Real risk takers. We're crazy. But that's trouble. So I hope you get to travel.

[<a id="01-25-22">01:25:22</a>]  I hope you all for money. Be fearless. Travel with your body, but travel with your mind.

[<a id="01-25-29">01:25:29</a>]  Don't just read everything that young people agree. You should talk to people that you

[<a id="01-25-33">01:25:33</a>]  don't agree with. That will do more good for you than anything else. And read a lot and

[<a id="01-25-39">01:25:39</a>]  travel a lot. And try to forgive yourself if you can. Believe me, I'm having a hard time

[<a id="01-25-46">01:25:46</a>]  doing that. But I'm trying. This kind of answers my finalized question. Because they're saying

[<a id="01-25-56">01:25:56</a>]  "Hurry the fuck up." What's the final advice you would give a young guy my age? Just something

[<a id="01-26-05">01:26:05</a>]  meaningful, just quickly, shortly. I said this last night from your dad, he was laughing.

[<a id="01-26-10">01:26:10</a>]  For women, the most important accessory that you could have for young women, the most important

[<a id="01-26-16">01:26:16</a>]  they could have accessory, it's not earrings or thing here or jewelry, the most important

[<a id="01-26-21">01:26:21</a>]  accessory for young women is gay men. Because they don't want to fuck you, but they know

[<a id="01-26-26">01:26:26</a>]  how men really think. And they're so good at reading and looking at you and see the

[<a id="01-26-32">01:26:32</a>]  full potential. Because young women are not very confident. Gay men are the most important

[<a id="01-26-37">01:26:37</a>]  accessory they could have. The more gay men they have, the better their lives will be.

[<a id="01-26-42">01:26:42</a>]  And two, for young women, if they learn to pick the right partner, fuck PhD, I'm fine,

[<a id="01-26-48">01:26:48</a>]  get education. But if there's one thing that they could make one best decision, if they

[<a id="01-26-54">01:26:54</a>]  learn to pick the right partner for themselves, they made it. They're going to have a really

[<a id="01-26-59">01:26:59</a>]  good life. As far as for young men, this is a really difficult time because on one hand,

[<a id="01-27-05">01:27:05</a>]  you want to be sensitive and kind, but you still have to be a man. I don't give a fuck

[<a id="01-27-10">01:27:10</a>]  what these liberal people say. You are a man and you have to be a man. We all have dragons,

[<a id="01-27-17">01:27:17</a>]  which is a fear. You have to learn to be authentic. And sometimes you'll lose friends, but you

[<a id="01-27-25">01:27:25</a>]  got to be your own man and be yourself. Whatever that thing you have to do, you have to learn

[<a id="01-27-30">01:27:30</a>]  to confront this dragon, which is just learn to be fearless. You could lie to whoever,

[<a id="01-27-39">01:27:39</a>]  just don't lie to yourself. I think that's more important. Don't let fear prevent you

[<a id="01-27-46">01:27:46</a>]  from pursuing anything that you want to do.

[<a id="01-27-49">01:27:49</a>]  How do I not lie to myself? A lot of times people do. This guy, the thing is he knows,

[<a id="01-27-56">01:27:56</a>]  he recognizes when I lie to myself. For example, I don't know, we were talking about this girl.

[<a id="01-28-03">01:28:03</a>]  I told you about this pretty girl that had no personality. He made me see that maybe

[<a id="01-28-09">01:28:09</a>]  it's actually not, maybe the personality doesn't fit. Maybe the thing I was thinking, "Oh,

[<a id="01-28-16">01:28:16</a>]  she's perfect. Whatever. She's actually not perfect and we're not a fit."

[<a id="01-28-20">01:28:20</a>]  She might be perfect for somebody else, but she's not for you. The earlier you figure

[<a id="01-28-24">01:28:24</a>]  that out. And you know what? Being alone is fine. Being alone doesn't mean you're lonely.

[<a id="01-28-31">01:28:31</a>]  You don't want to hang out with people that make you feel lonely either. You want to hang

[<a id="01-28-36">01:28:36</a>]  out with people that bring the best out of you, not the worst out of you. And sometimes

[<a id="01-28-41">01:28:41</a>]  you're the wrong person for a particular girl. You're doing the worst thing for her. So it

[<a id="01-28-45">01:28:45</a>]  takes time, but you know, it's easier said than done. But whatever it is, just remember,

[<a id="01-28-52">01:28:52</a>]  you want to live a life in a way that the last one minute or two minutes when you're

[<a id="01-28-56">01:28:56</a>]  dying in bed, that you don't have a regret, that you think all the positive things that

[<a id="01-29-01">01:29:01</a>]  made you happy. Well, I'm glad you lose your podcast cherry with me, but this is such a

[<a id="01-29-09">01:29:09</a>]  weird thing. But I'm working with Virgil, but yeah.

[<a id="01-29-12">01:29:12</a>]  That was really cool talking to you, man. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for interviewing me.

[<a id="01-29-16">01:29:16</a>]  There you go. Nice. Your son is natural, man. That's why you guys should have a podcast

[<a id="01-29-24">01:29:24</a>]  called "Before and After."
