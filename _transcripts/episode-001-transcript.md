[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  Yeah, it's so cool. You wanted a podium. This is, it's close to it. You're going to make

[<a id="00-00-13">00:00:13</a>]  a presidential address, but I mean, yeah, these pick up. Wow. Even a bit, even here,

[<a id="00-00-29">00:00:29</a>]  you can, I guess we should be about, have a listen yourself. It's really sensitive,

[<a id="00-00-36">00:00:36</a>]  which is cool. Maybe we can, wait, I could hear you talk to you. Yeah. Like from, I'm here like

[<a id="00-00-44">00:00:44</a>]  three, four inches away. Yeah. And maybe we put them, we'll put them like this and then it's less,

[<a id="00-00-51">00:00:51</a>]  does that sound okay? Yeah. Yeah. I don't mind using headphones because I could hear you better.

[<a id="00-00-58">00:00:58</a>]  Okay, cool. Yeah. All right. That's cool. Yeah. You tell me if I'm getting too far from the mic.

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  All right. So are you already recording? No, no. I mean, I guess. On that one, yeah. And this. It's

[<a id="00-01-18">00:01:18</a>]  not like we don't do anything formal. Yeah, that's cool. All right, we're rolling. What is it? Today is, so it's

[<a id="00-01-29">00:01:29</a>]  November 22nd. Friday, November 22nd. Zurich, Switzerland. I've been in, I guess I've been in

[<a id="00-01-39">00:01:39</a>]  Switzerland by 12 hours. And we just had a nice coffee break with a lady named Hara. Yeah. I was

[<a id="00-01-51">00:01:51</a>]  surprised because I just had this notion that most Swiss are not that personable. Well, not personable,

[<a id="00-01-58">00:01:58</a>]  but approachable, you know. And she was very, very nice. And then when we find that she's great,

[<a id="00-02-05">00:02:05</a>]  it made sense, you know, she was very sunny disposition and things like that. Yeah. I mean,

[<a id="00-02-11">00:02:11</a>]  well, I think you made the, like, cause you, you were naturally like welcoming, come and join us.

[<a id="00-02-19">00:02:19</a>]  And. Am I? Yeah. Yeah. For this place. Definitely. And. So it's a very low standards here. People

[<a id="00-02-29">00:02:29</a>]  don't do that because it's just, it's a timing thing. I think you were very quick. Cause I have,

[<a id="00-02-34">00:02:34</a>]  what I call shitty fame. So I'm not famous, but in the city and I could, cause it's small enough

[<a id="00-02-42">00:02:42</a>]  people have seen me doing comedy. So she was like, Oh, I know you. I can't even remember. It's

[<a id="00-02-49">00:02:49</a>]  interesting cause I think it's probably true in South Korea too. People don't talk to strangers,

[<a id="00-02-53">00:02:53</a>]  you know. And I think for some extent it's probably true in Japan too. But I have a hard

[<a id="00-03-00">00:03:00</a>]  time explaining myself. Like you were telling me, look, nobody's going to come to see me do shows,

[<a id="00-03-05">00:03:05</a>]  which I understand because that's in the States too. But I'm having a hard time explaining what

[<a id="00-03-13">00:03:13</a>]  do I do or who I am, you know? Cause I think I got such a really weird background as well, you know?

[<a id="00-03-19">00:03:19</a>]  And I mean, I think, I mean, there's something I say about comedy. It's like when I, when I got

[<a id="00-03-31">00:03:31</a>]  into it during the lockdown, I don't know if you know Judy Carter. Of course she wrote that stupid

[<a id="00-03-37">00:03:37</a>]  book, not stupid book, but she's famous for writing how to do stand up comedy like 30 plus years ago.

[<a id="00-03-44">00:03:44</a>]  Yeah. The new comedy Bible. And I did, I actually took her class years ago. We have something in

[<a id="00-03-51">00:03:51</a>]  common. I took her class too. It was actually, she delegated all the work to another comedian

[<a id="00-03-56">00:03:56</a>]  called Dean who was, he was phenomenal. And, uh, but there was one of the things is about

[<a id="00-04-03">00:04:03</a>]  like your comedy career and how you've got to focus if you want to get famous,

[<a id="00-04-09">00:04:09</a>]  which, which when you're for me at 50, that feels ridiculous. Like, and if from what I know about

[<a id="00-04-17">00:04:17</a>]  your background, but also if I look at my own life, I feel like I've lived seven lives already.

[<a id="00-04-23">00:04:23</a>]  And in terms of like the role, it's so strange to say you want to be famous,

[<a id="00-04-27">00:04:27</a>]  but especially young kids, they want to be famous. Yeah. I have such a mixed feeling about that, you

[<a id="00-04-33">00:04:33</a>]  know? Um, I mean, because every time I hear that, I just think mental illness. That's what I think,

[<a id="00-04-40">00:04:40</a>]  you know? Yeah. And I mean, for me, that's like famous, maybe a means to an end. I just enjoyed

[<a id="00-04-49">00:04:49</a>]  doing comedy shows and unfortunately you have to do the whole promotion thing to get people to come

[<a id="00-04-56">00:04:56</a>]  to shows. But every time I think about stand up comedy, I mean, of course it's, you know,

[<a id="00-05-01">00:05:01</a>]  I just saw bill burr last Sunday. So it's what today's Friday. Yeah. Like six days ago. And

[<a id="00-05-07">00:05:07</a>]  I haven't, I mean, I didn't, you know, I don't want to bother the guy, but I saw him after the

[<a id="00-05-12">00:05:12</a>]  show. I've talked to him like a minute or two, always generous, great guy. It was really nice to

[<a id="00-05-17">00:05:17</a>]  see him to see a guy at that level. And also, you know, for, for anybody who followed comedy last

[<a id="00-05-24">00:05:24</a>]  four or five years, there's been comedians that we like. We find out that they're far from perfect.

[<a id="00-05-30">00:05:30</a>]  People, they were doing stuff offstage. That's questionable. I don't want to name their names,

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  you know? Yeah. Yeah. But burr is one of those few people that I have to say,

[<a id="00-05-40">00:05:40</a>]  I've never heard anything bad about the guy ever how generous he is with other people. And,

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  and even with angry thing when he's on stage, it's pretty justifiable. He's just genuinely upset

[<a id="00-05-57">00:05:57</a>]  about something, you know? Yeah. But now it's kind of funny to see him because he's so successful,

[<a id="00-06-03">00:06:03</a>]  famous, people love him. It's hard to be angry when you're being beloved and have successful.

[<a id="00-06-08">00:06:08</a>]  So what was so great, cause I've never seen him do this before. It was the first time his wife

[<a id="00-06-14">00:06:14</a>]  was there and she was offstage and he's talking back and forth to her and he's trying to convince

[<a id="00-06-20">00:06:20</a>]  her to get on stage, which she refused wisely. But that was a really funny banter, but it's really

[<a id="00-06-26">00:06:26</a>]  nice to see him, somebody at that level, worked really hard for many decades, reaching it, you

[<a id="00-06-31">00:06:31</a>]  know? But at our level, it just feels like we're just getting hammered, just hitting ourself in

[<a id="00-06-37">00:06:37</a>]  the face when we're doing it because you have to be pretty fucking insane to do stand up comedy.

[<a id="00-06-43">00:06:43</a>]  I mean, if you're getting something out of it, and I know some of my colleagues

[<a id="00-06-48">00:06:48</a>]  last couple of years got in trouble because they have success and they're going after women and

[<a id="00-06-54">00:06:54</a>]  we're not exactly most mature groups of people, you know?

[<a id="00-06-58">00:06:58</a>]  So, yeah, I think, I mean, about Bill Byrd, one thing is, one of my weird things is whenever I

[<a id="00-07-06">00:07:06</a>]  wake up at three in the morning and can't sleep, I listen to Bill Byrd's podcast.

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  Oh, do you really?

[<a id="00-07-12">00:07:12</a>]  Yeah, he sends me to sleep, but I've listened to it.

[<a id="00-07-16">00:07:16</a>]  That sounds like insult.

[<a id="00-07-17">00:07:17</a>]  It is kind of, but it's cause what's great is he's got, his voice is usually consistent,

[<a id="00-07-23">00:07:23</a>]  he does it on his own.

[<a id="00-07-24">00:07:24</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-07-25">00:07:25</a>]  You turn the volume down to just the right level and it just sends, so I've got all his anger

[<a id="00-07-29">00:07:29</a>]  in my subconscious, but also he's actually, if I look at his perspective of the world,

[<a id="00-07-37">00:07:37</a>]  some of the things he talks about, like he's always going on about how he hates bankers

[<a id="00-07-42">00:07:42</a>]  cause they own everything and how the system's rigged when you look into it.

[<a id="00-07-48">00:07:48</a>]  I'm glad you said that because when Jerry O'Neill passed away, 2011, Bill was one of

[<a id="00-07-58">00:07:58</a>]  his closest friends and Bill told me like, last Sunday, so they got in a big fight,

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  they never got reconciled, kind of sad, but, you know, when Steve Jobs passed away,

[<a id="00-08-10">00:08:10</a>]  Apple turned around and replaced him by having different experts.

[<a id="00-08-14">00:08:14</a>]  So they had an expert from architect, they had an expert from music, like Dr. Dre or something.

[<a id="00-08-18">00:08:18</a>]  So they brought all this expert to kind of bring back, I mean, how do you replace

[<a id="00-08-23">00:08:23</a>]  something like Steve Jobs at Apple?

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  And this is very, very difficult.

[<a id="00-08-26">00:08:26</a>]  And when Patrice died, there was two comedians that kind of started coming around that time,

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  Shane Gillis and Tim Dillon.

[<a id="00-08-36">00:08:36</a>]  I've seen those.

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  I've never talked to them.

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  I like both of them.

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-42">00:08:42</a>]  Tim Dillon's got the thing that Burr has.

[<a id="00-08-45">00:08:45</a>]  I know they're funny and ridiculous at times, but they're both righteous people.

[<a id="00-08-48">00:08:48</a>]  Their anger comes from because they really pay attention to what's going on.

[<a id="00-08-52">00:08:52</a>]  I really particularly like when Tim did that, and he's over the board crazy and kind of

[<a id="00-08-59">00:08:59</a>]  sarcastic and silly, but that one episode he did on Ukraine, he was dead on right about that.

[<a id="00-09-05">00:09:05</a>]  It's not about democracy or saving the world.

[<a id="00-09-08">00:09:08</a>]  There was something bigger than that, you know?

[<a id="00-09-10">00:09:10</a>]  And I think he's so knowledgeable about what Americans and our government have done overseas

[<a id="00-09-15">00:09:15</a>]  and what power does to people and corruption and things like that.

[<a id="00-09-19">00:09:19</a>]  Oddly enough, we were here in Switzerland where one of the guys he talks about is Alan

[<a id="00-09-24">00:09:24</a>]  Dulles, who was the head of OSS and later on CIA, and he was one of those dirty motherfuckers.

[<a id="00-09-31">00:09:31</a>]  He really was, and he was doing dirty business here, and he was protecting Nazis,

[<a id="00-09-36">00:09:36</a>]  literally Nazis here, you know?

[<a id="00-09-38">00:09:38</a>]  And I liked him, I liked Burr, because I think they're not going to say it, but to me they're

[<a id="00-09-47">00:09:47</a>]  pretty righteous people to me, you know?

[<a id="00-09-49">00:09:49</a>]  Have you ever seen Tim Dillon did this episode where he reviewed

[<a id="00-09-54">00:09:54</a>]  the opening video for the Gotthard Tunnel, which is a tunnel in Switzerland?

[<a id="00-09-59">00:09:59</a>]  No, I missed that one.

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  This is a big engineering achievement for Switzerland.

[<a id="00-10-02">00:10:02</a>]  They built this tunnel through the mountains from the north part of Switzerland to the

[<a id="00-10-08">00:10:08</a>]  Italian part in the south.

[<a id="00-10-09">00:10:09</a>]  When they opened it, they had this bizarre ceremony, which looks like a satanic ritual.

[<a id="00-10-17">00:10:17</a>]  They had dudes dressed up as goats.

[<a id="00-10-19">00:10:19</a>]  What are we talking about, like 10 years ago, 15 years ago?

[<a id="00-10-23">00:10:23</a>]  It's about 10 years ago, but Tim Dillon reviewed it like two years ago, someone said.

[<a id="00-10-30">00:10:30</a>]  And he's taken it as hilarious, but he's just stunned by how they're not even hiding.

[<a id="00-10-40">00:10:40</a>]  This is like if you believe in World Economic Forum conspiracy theories, they're running

[<a id="00-10-46">00:10:46</a>]  the world, they have this evil satanic agenda.

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  Like this ceremony is just wide open.

[<a id="00-10-54">00:10:54</a>]  This reminds me of Denver International Airport, because it's shaped like swastika, and there's

[<a id="00-10-59">00:10:59</a>]  - Which airport?

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  - Denver in Colorado.

[<a id="00-11-01">00:11:01</a>]  - Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-11-02">00:11:02</a>]  - It's shaped like swastika.

[<a id="00-11-03">00:11:03</a>]  And what's funny is they're self-aware airport, because they have a science where like they

[<a id="00-11-09">00:11:09</a>]  will show a picture of like a reptile saying, "Is this airport run by reptilian conspiracy

[<a id="00-11-14">00:11:14</a>]  people?"

[<a id="00-11-14">00:11:14</a>]  They have all this funny stuff around the airport kind of piling up.

[<a id="00-11-19">00:11:19</a>]  - I've got to say, a swastika is probably a pretty good design for an airport.

[<a id="00-11-24">00:11:24</a>]  You can get the maximum number of planes lined up there.

[<a id="00-11-28">00:11:28</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-11-29">00:11:29</a>]  - It's like it makes sense somehow.

[<a id="00-11-33">00:11:33</a>]  - Well, I'm sure it's really awkward for an Israeli airline to land in Denver.

[<a id="00-11-37">00:11:37</a>]  But it's weird with this conspiracy and secrets, because these days, what's funny is like it's

[<a id="00-11-45">00:11:45</a>]  better to tell people the truth and nobody cares.

[<a id="00-11-47">00:11:47</a>]  During COVID, they were showing a picture of UFOs.

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  And if they showed that in the '80s, I think there would have been massive hysteria and

[<a id="00-11-56">00:11:56</a>]  panic.

[<a id="00-11-56">00:11:56</a>]  Nobody cares.

[<a id="00-11-58">00:11:58</a>]  The public response is like, "Okay, what's next?"

[<a id="00-12-00">00:12:00</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-12-01">00:12:01</a>]  - Yeah, nobody cares.

[<a id="00-12-01">00:12:01</a>]  You could give all the information and say they're doing all kinds of terrible things.

[<a id="00-12-05">00:12:05</a>]  But most people are just so indifferent these days.

[<a id="00-12-07">00:12:07</a>]  - I think it's too much.

[<a id="00-12-09">00:12:09</a>]  - A little overwhelmed, right?

[<a id="00-12-12">00:12:12</a>]  - I mean, yesterday I was doing this comedy show and I was doing a joke about how we're

[<a id="00-12-18">00:12:18</a>]  this close to World War III right now.

[<a id="00-12-20">00:12:20</a>]  And then there was this woman and the second one was like, "What?"

[<a id="00-12-24">00:12:24</a>]  And I'm like, "How do you not know that Russia and NATO are this close to things kicking

[<a id="00-12-32">00:12:32</a>]  off?"

[<a id="00-12-33">00:12:33</a>]  And you're like, "I haven't even heard of this."

[<a id="00-12-35">00:12:35</a>]  And I mean, I think...

[<a id="00-12-37">00:12:37</a>]  - Personally, I think a lot of this stuff is just exaggerated.

[<a id="00-12-41">00:12:41</a>]  It's just like a performance art.

[<a id="00-12-43">00:12:43</a>]  - Maybe, yeah.

[<a id="00-12-45">00:12:45</a>]  Yeah, maybe.

[<a id="00-12-46">00:12:46</a>]  - But I mean, I'm addicted to listening to stuff about how the world runs and this kind

[<a id="00-12-55">00:12:55</a>]  of stuff.

[<a id="00-12-56">00:12:56</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-12-56">00:12:56</a>]  Or how it doesn't run.

[<a id="00-12-57">00:12:57</a>]  - And then once you've got into that stuff, it's almost like you're living in a separate

[<a id="00-13-06">00:13:06</a>]  reality to other people.

[<a id="00-13-07">00:13:07</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-13-08">00:13:08</a>]  I mean, how many disaster movies do we have to watch in Hollywood?

[<a id="00-13-10">00:13:10</a>]  The guy said, "In the world."

[<a id="00-13-13">00:13:13</a>]  And then I just wish it does end.

[<a id="00-13-16">00:13:16</a>]  I'm sick of this.

[<a id="00-13-17">00:13:17</a>]  It's just like, I've heard this kind of shit all my life.

[<a id="00-13-22">00:13:22</a>]  And the danger of this and that.

[<a id="00-13-24">00:13:24</a>]  But at the end of the day, I think a lot of it is really grossly exaggerated.

[<a id="00-13-28">00:13:28</a>]  - I think the thing is, there's...

[<a id="00-13-31">00:13:31</a>]  - I'm not worried about anything.

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  - Of course, with most things, I have a half-smart idea.

[<a id="00-13-35">00:13:35</a>]  I try a bit, but there's a bit that never worked where I go like, I was trying to say

[<a id="00-13-40">00:13:40</a>]  this to an audience, back in the Middle Ages, they had this terror of dragons.

[<a id="00-13-45">00:13:45</a>]  And then the king would rock up and go, "Oh, we must stop the dragons.

[<a id="00-13-51">00:13:51</a>]  That's why I'm going to need your goats and your first daughter and all your money to

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  help for the dragons."

[<a id="00-14-00">00:14:00</a>]  Until somebody finally figured out there's no dragons.

[<a id="00-14-04">00:14:04</a>]  And a lot of this stuff is, to me, it's like, it's the same thing.

[<a id="00-14-11">00:14:11</a>]  There's always got to be a fear of something, some disaster.

[<a id="00-14-16">00:14:16</a>]  So that you're like, "Oh, well, then take my money because I need you to protect me."

[<a id="00-14-22">00:14:22</a>]  - Yeah, and I think we may make a small example where I see these Asian American groups representing

[<a id="00-14-29">00:14:29</a>]  me and other Asian people.

[<a id="00-14-30">00:14:30</a>]  I never asked them to do that, but they're self-appointed.

[<a id="00-14-33">00:14:33</a>]  - Oh, interesting.

[<a id="00-14-34">00:14:34</a>]  - And they're all doing all kinds of shit that I don't really give a shit about.

[<a id="00-14-37">00:14:37</a>]  - Like what kind of things?

[<a id="00-14-39">00:14:39</a>]  - Well, I don't know.

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  Like if there's an incident where an Asian person got hurt or ridiculed in public, that

[<a id="00-14-44">00:14:44</a>]  these people are going to go and rectify that.

[<a id="00-14-46">00:14:46</a>]  But I didn't fucking ask you to do that.

[<a id="00-14-48">00:14:48</a>]  You know, most Asian people, like myself, who are fobbed, fresh off the boat and have

[<a id="00-14-53">00:14:53</a>]  accent, they're too busy working.

[<a id="00-14-55">00:14:55</a>]  We don't care about things that Asian Americans are into.

[<a id="00-14-58">00:14:58</a>]  You know, there's a difference between Asians living in America with the US citizenship,

[<a id="00-15-02">00:15:02</a>]  but to me, they're Asians.

[<a id="00-15-04">00:15:04</a>]  And there's Asian Americans who have faces like mine, but they don't know anything about

[<a id="00-15-08">00:15:08</a>]  Asian heritage and culture.

[<a id="00-15-10">00:15:10</a>]  But they're using this like a pretext to like, you know, representing the whole group.

[<a id="00-15-14">00:15:14</a>]  But like, who are you?

[<a id="00-15-15">00:15:15</a>]  Nobody asked you to do any of this stuff.

[<a id="00-15-16">00:15:16</a>]  - So they're like, what, second generation?

[<a id="00-15-18">00:15:18</a>]  - Or third or whatever.

[<a id="00-15-20">00:15:20</a>]  They don't know anything about their background.

[<a id="00-15-22">00:15:22</a>]  That's what I like when they say, you know, Asian heritage, this and that.

[<a id="00-15-25">00:15:25</a>]  Like when I talk to them, they don't know anything.

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  Like you can't tell me that something's important.

[<a id="00-15-29">00:15:29</a>]  You don't even bother to spend time learning that.

[<a id="00-15-32">00:15:32</a>]  So you have no business telling me like, well, you know, we have to do this for Asian group.

[<a id="00-15-36">00:15:36</a>]  Like, look.

[<a id="00-15-37">00:15:37</a>]  - I've always found it weird how much America's made an identity out of race.

[<a id="00-15-45">00:15:45</a>]  And I know there's like, probably there's, if anyone ever heard that, they want to kill me.

[<a id="00-15-51">00:15:51</a>]  But the thing is growing up in England, we took a lot of people and it's got fucked up history.

[<a id="00-15-58">00:15:58</a>]  We took people from the colonies that we captured.

[<a id="00-16-01">00:16:01</a>]  And then by the sixties, we needed people to work.

[<a id="00-16-05">00:16:05</a>]  So we invited all kinds of people.

[<a id="00-16-07">00:16:07</a>]  And mostly it worked out pretty well.

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  There was some times where there was like different, we call it race riots and stuff.

[<a id="00-16-15">00:16:15</a>]  But it used to be, England now is a different place.

[<a id="00-16-20">00:16:20</a>]  At least what I hear, cause I don't live there.

[<a id="00-16-22">00:16:22</a>]  But back in the day, it was just like, your color wasn't really an issue.

[<a id="00-16-29">00:16:29</a>]  - I think when you look at media, you think there's so much conflict between different groups, right?

[<a id="00-16-35">00:16:35</a>]  So like on my birthday this year, I went to Israel and based on what you see on television,

[<a id="00-16-41">00:16:41</a>]  you would think they're always fighting Jews and Muslims are fighting each other.

[<a id="00-16-44">00:16:44</a>]  But soon as I got there, like, you know, there's Jews and Muslims walking around in a subway.

[<a id="00-16-52">00:16:52</a>]  You know, it is a little weird.

[<a id="00-16-55">00:16:55</a>]  You're taking a subway, you see attractive Jewish girl in the IDF uniform with a machine gun,

[<a id="00-17-01">00:17:01</a>]  things like that.

[<a id="00-17-01">00:17:01</a>]  And that cross from her is a Muslim girl, completely covered in burqa and things like that.

[<a id="00-17-05">00:17:05</a>]  And they're not friends.

[<a id="00-17-07">00:17:07</a>]  They're just minding their own business.

[<a id="00-17-10">00:17:10</a>]  They exist peacefully.

[<a id="00-17-11">00:17:11</a>]  And I think most people just, it's not as people think it is.

[<a id="00-17-18">00:17:18</a>]  I think most people just mind their own business.

[<a id="00-17-20">00:17:20</a>]  Cause they have a billion things to worry about.

[<a id="00-17-21">00:17:21</a>]  They're taking care of their family, they have to work.

[<a id="00-17-23">00:17:23</a>]  And I went to a couple of restaurants where it's like,

[<a id="00-17-26">00:17:26</a>]  Jews are in a restaurant owned by Muslims.

[<a id="00-17-29">00:17:29</a>]  You just don't bring up those things that upset people.

[<a id="00-17-31">00:17:31</a>]  Just, hey, you know, order your food, eat, pay and get the fuck out.

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  So the Muslims could take your money and pay for their bill for their family.

[<a id="00-17-40">00:17:40</a>]  You know, like, I think everybody get along fine.

[<a id="00-17-42">00:17:42</a>]  You know, of course, if you go Gaza, it's a different story.

[<a id="00-17-45">00:17:45</a>]  But I just think most people mind their own business.

[<a id="00-17-51">00:17:51</a>]  And I think that's the best thing you could do.

[<a id="00-17-53">00:17:53</a>]  It's too dangerous when people go their other way and try to help other people.

[<a id="00-17-57">00:17:57</a>]  This is what like liberal white people are trying to do.

[<a id="00-18-00">00:18:00</a>]  It's, you know, Malcolm X famously said, just beware of white liberals.

[<a id="00-18-05">00:18:05</a>]  They're the most dangerous people out there.

[<a id="00-18-07">00:18:07</a>]  Conservative people are like wolves.

[<a id="00-18-10">00:18:10</a>]  Like they're up to no good.

[<a id="00-18-12">00:18:12</a>]  So you know how to deal with them.

[<a id="00-18-13">00:18:13</a>]  When you deal with white liberal people, you trust them.

[<a id="00-18-16">00:18:16</a>]  And because you open up to them, there's a chance that they might betray you.

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  That's the danger of white liberals, you know.

[<a id="00-18-23">00:18:23</a>]  I have a similar thing I say with my kids.

[<a id="00-18-27">00:18:27</a>]  Because for a while, my daughter was going about, yeah, I want to do something that has impact.

[<a id="00-18-32">00:18:32</a>]  And I'm just like, you know what the worst thing is on this planet?

[<a id="00-18-36">00:18:36</a>]  A young person that wants to change the world.

[<a id="00-18-38">00:18:38</a>]  Like, if you can tidy your own bedroom consistently and run your own life,

[<a id="00-18-44">00:18:44</a>]  then you've reached a level where you've figured enough shit out

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  that you could actually do something.

[<a id="00-18-49">00:18:49</a>]  That's why those young people are crazy to me.

[<a id="00-18-51">00:18:51</a>]  Because they don't even fix their fucking bed in the morning.

[<a id="00-18-54">00:18:54</a>]  They don't have a job or whatnot.

[<a id="00-18-55">00:18:55</a>]  But they think they could change the world.

[<a id="00-18-57">00:18:57</a>]  And here's the thing, they probably can change the world for worse, not for better.

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  Because are you well-versed in education, experience, and live long enough to know

[<a id="00-19-09">00:19:09</a>]  what's the problem, what's causing the problem, and you know the solution,

[<a id="00-19-12">00:19:12</a>]  and you know how to execute the solution.

[<a id="00-19-14">00:19:14</a>]  You're a pretty arrogant person to think like that.

[<a id="00-19-16">00:19:16</a>]  I just think one of the number one or number two rules of Eddie Murphy is saying,

[<a id="00-19-21">00:19:21</a>]  mind your own damn business.

[<a id="00-19-22">00:19:22</a>]  And the world will be a better place if you do mind your own business, you know.

[<a id="00-19-26">00:19:26</a>]  But I don't think they do that because growing up in America,

[<a id="00-19-30">00:19:30</a>]  like most Japanese people watch cowboy movies think,

[<a id="00-19-35">00:19:35</a>]  cowboy movies are exactly the way cowboys live.

[<a id="00-19-38">00:19:38</a>]  You know, they're idealistic and they're protecting the weak

[<a id="00-19-41">00:19:41</a>]  and they protect ladies and things like that.

[<a id="00-19-44">00:19:44</a>]  Boy, that's far from the truth, you know.

[<a id="00-19-47">00:19:47</a>]  And I think...

[<a id="00-19-47">00:19:47</a>]  Actually, I don't know if it's true,

[<a id="00-19-50">00:19:50</a>]  but I heard that in reality, most cowboys were black.

[<a id="00-19-53">00:19:53</a>]  I don't know if that's true, but the myth of the...

[<a id="00-19-57">00:19:57</a>]  I know I've never verified this, but in the movies, the cowboys are white guys.

[<a id="00-20-04">00:20:04</a>]  And it said in reality, the guys moving the cattle around were usually black.

[<a id="00-20-09">00:20:09</a>]  I don't know any of the racial component of cowboys.

[<a id="00-20-13">00:20:13</a>]  All I know is that my understanding of cowboys back then is they're poorly paid laborers

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  and have pretty difficult, miserable lives, you know.

[<a id="00-20-20">00:20:20</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  So I think we have a tendency to idealize.

[<a id="00-20-24">00:20:24</a>]  But I'm 55 years old and I've read some books in my life.

[<a id="00-20-28">00:20:28</a>]  I travel a little bit.

[<a id="00-20-29">00:20:29</a>]  And I just think you should respect people.

[<a id="00-20-37">00:20:37</a>]  You could disagree with somebody if you should respect people.

[<a id="00-20-40">00:20:40</a>]  And two, just because they do something different from you, it doesn't mean it's wrong.

[<a id="00-20-45">00:20:45</a>]  And even if it's unjust, there's not a whole lot you could do to get yourself involved,

[<a id="00-20-52">00:20:52</a>]  because all you're going to do is probably...

[<a id="00-20-53">00:20:53</a>]  Most likely, you make the situation worse and get yourself killed, you know.

[<a id="00-20-57">00:20:57</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-20-57">00:20:57</a>]  And it's a really difficult thing to do that when you're young.

[<a id="00-21-00">00:21:00</a>]  You want to do the decent thing, but I think that's...

[<a id="00-21-03">00:21:03</a>]  It's dangerous when you think you could get yourself involved, you know.

[<a id="00-21-07">00:21:07</a>]  Did you ever read the Tao Te Ching or Tao Te Ching?

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  That's the Chinese book of wisdom.

[<a id="00-21-15">00:21:15</a>]  No, but there's a guy named James Inman,

[<a id="00-21-17">00:21:17</a>]  very friendly comedian, won the either Seattle or San Francisco comedy competition,

[<a id="00-21-21">00:21:21</a>]  a good friend of Doug Stanhope.

[<a id="00-21-22">00:21:22</a>]  And he gets drunk and angry, screaming loud,

[<a id="00-21-25">00:21:25</a>]  but he's always talking about this peaceful book from Asia, ironically.

[<a id="00-21-31">00:21:31</a>]  I said, I don't know, when I was, I don't know, I don't know why, but when I was like 18, I got

[<a id="00-21-38">00:21:38</a>]  fascinated with, I read The Arts of War, I read The Book of Five Rings, is that Chinese?

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  Miyamoto Musashi, yeah.

[<a id="00-21-46">00:21:46</a>]  Yeah, and also Tao Te Ching.

[<a id="00-21-47">00:21:47</a>]  He killed a kid, by the way.

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  Really?

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-21-50">00:21:50</a>]  What an asshole.

[<a id="00-21-51">00:21:51</a>]  His thing was, we'll continue whatever you...

[<a id="00-21-56">00:21:56</a>]  But his thing was, he was going to town to town,

[<a id="00-21-58">00:21:58</a>]  challenging different school of martial art.

[<a id="00-22-01">00:22:01</a>]  And he will beat them.

[<a id="00-22-02">00:22:02</a>]  And for whatever reason, this one school or the one family had him as a representative,

[<a id="00-22-07">00:22:07</a>]  but they brought like 50 to 100 henchmen to protecting him.

[<a id="00-22-11">00:22:11</a>]  But he waited, waited until he's sneaking and killed a bunch of people, including the kid.

[<a id="00-22-14">00:22:14</a>]  Because once you put kid as your representative, he had no choice but to kill the kid.

[<a id="00-22-19">00:22:19</a>]  He's not something like a psychopath, murderer, you know.

[<a id="00-22-26">00:22:26</a>]  I mean, the thing about Tao Te Ching is, like, a lot of it's about how to live your life.

[<a id="00-22-32">00:22:32</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-22-33">00:22:33</a>]  But you read that book, and I did the same thing with the European book, My Kump.

[<a id="00-22-38">00:22:38</a>]  Am I saying that right?

[<a id="00-22-43">00:22:43</a>]  How do you say that book?

[<a id="00-22-44">00:22:44</a>]  Tell me again.

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  What was the Hitler's book?

[<a id="00-22-47">00:22:47</a>]  Oh, Mein Kump.

[<a id="00-22-49">00:22:49</a>]  Yeah, My Struggle, yeah.

[<a id="00-22-50">00:22:50</a>]  My Struggle.

[<a id="00-22-53">00:22:53</a>]  Yeah, that's on the, that will get you looks if you want your hands.

[<a id="00-22-57">00:22:57</a>]  You're carrying that with you.

[<a id="00-22-58">00:22:58</a>]  No, but it was interesting.

[<a id="00-23-01">00:23:01</a>]  What I remember about it was like the last.

[<a id="00-23-04">00:23:04</a>]  I couldn't believe Hitler did audiobook for it.

[<a id="00-23-06">00:23:06</a>]  Hitler, would he be a podcaster today?

[<a id="00-23-12">00:23:12</a>]  I think he probably would.

[<a id="00-23-13">00:23:13</a>]  But you'd have to get him to not, you'd be, his producer would be like,

[<a id="00-23-17">00:23:17</a>]  can you stop yelling into the mic, Hitler?

[<a id="00-23-19">00:23:19</a>]  Just chill out a little bit.

[<a id="00-23-21">00:23:21</a>]  It's got to be weird because he'll have Jewish producers, you know.

[<a id="00-23-24">00:23:24</a>]  Jewish producers are controlling.

[<a id="00-23-30">00:23:30</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-23-31">00:23:31</a>]  I mean, he said he had an Instagram account.

[<a id="00-23-33">00:23:33</a>]  Jesus will have Instagram account and a Twitter account and things like that.

[<a id="00-23-38">00:23:38</a>]  I mean, he probably, if he'd learned the techniques, he could probably be killing it.

[<a id="00-23-45">00:23:45</a>]  I mean, Andrew Tate is a controversial figure.

[<a id="00-23-50">00:23:50</a>]  And if you look at a lot of the tactics he's used,

[<a id="00-23-53">00:23:53</a>]  like the way to blow up on social media is divide and conquer.

[<a id="00-23-57">00:23:57</a>]  So you get half the people on board with your message

[<a id="00-24-01">00:24:01</a>]  and the other half hate you because of your message.

[<a id="00-24-04">00:24:04</a>]  In fact, hate watching, hate listening is even a big word and the fans most likely.

[<a id="00-24-08">00:24:08</a>]  Probably, yeah.

[<a id="00-24-09">00:24:09</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-24-09">00:24:09</a>]  I was at the book arrest on his court date.

[<a id="00-24-13">00:24:13</a>]  I got the dates wrong.

[<a id="00-24-14">00:24:14</a>]  I got their day afterwards.

[<a id="00-24-15">00:24:15</a>]  You sure?

[<a id="00-24-16">00:24:16</a>]  Oh, wow.

[<a id="00-24-16">00:24:16</a>]  I went to the court.

[<a id="00-24-19">00:24:19</a>]  Anyway, you know, I guess we're kind of meandering.

[<a id="00-24-22">00:24:22</a>]  And I think, you know, we met about, what, a year and a half, two years ago?

[<a id="00-24-28">00:24:28</a>]  I can't even remember.

[<a id="00-24-29">00:24:29</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-24-31">00:24:31</a>]  Christian, who we're at Christian's place right now, introduced us.

[<a id="00-24-35">00:24:35</a>]  And did we just meet that one time?

[<a id="00-24-39">00:24:39</a>]  The next day, we went to the coffee shop, recorded a podcast.

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  I'm trying to reconstruct.

[<a id="00-24-45">00:24:45</a>]  I can't remember.

[<a id="00-24-46">00:24:46</a>]  Yeah, I think we did.

[<a id="00-24-48">00:24:48</a>]  So basically, we met and we were talking.

[<a id="00-24-53">00:24:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  So it was very interesting to me because at that particular moment, I got out of a,

[<a id="00-24-59">00:24:59</a>]  whatever you call it nowadays, a situationship with a lady who'd been through something,

[<a id="00-25-06">00:25:06</a>]  let's say, a little bit Epstein-y.

[<a id="00-25-11">00:25:11</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-11">00:25:11</a>]  Epstein-y.

[<a id="00-25-14">00:25:14</a>]  And it opened my eyes to a bunch of stuff I didn't know about.

[<a id="00-25-18">00:25:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-19">00:25:19</a>]  Freaked me out.

[<a id="00-25-19">00:25:19</a>]  And I've been ranting to Christian about this stuff, about like,

[<a id="00-25-24">00:25:24</a>]  "Shit, there's this and there's this and there's this."

[<a id="00-25-26">00:25:26</a>]  And he's like, "You gotta meet Yoshi."

[<a id="00-25-28">00:25:28</a>]  Oh, so this lady that you were hanging out, she allegedly had some kind of sexual

[<a id="00-25-33">00:25:33</a>]  thing that happened to her.

[<a id="00-25-37">00:25:37</a>]  And then she started talking about underbelly of Swiss world.

[<a id="00-25-42">00:25:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-43">00:25:43</a>]  And you guys were talking about, and this is something that you were not familiar with,

[<a id="00-25-45">00:25:45</a>]  because I think Swiss people seem to be extremely polite and these private things are kind of

[<a id="00-25-50">00:25:50</a>]  hidden away, like most other places, I guess.

[<a id="00-25-52">00:25:52</a>]  So that's when Christian mentioned my name.

[<a id="00-25-54">00:25:54</a>]  That's how that started.

[<a id="00-25-55">00:25:55</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-56">00:25:56</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-25-57">00:25:57</a>]  You were in town and he's like, he just said, "Dude, you've got to meet Yoshi."

[<a id="00-26-01">00:26:01</a>]  Okay, that makes sense.

[<a id="00-26-02">00:26:02</a>]  And then we just got talking.

[<a id="00-26-04">00:26:04</a>]  You were, and yeah, I don't know, we just sort of amped each other up on...

[<a id="00-26-10">00:26:10</a>]  Wait, wait, did we meet on the day we were recording podcast or did we meet prior to

[<a id="00-26-16">00:26:16</a>]  that?

[<a id="00-26-17">00:26:17</a>]  I think we met maybe the day or two before at a bar.

[<a id="00-26-20">00:26:20</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-26-20">00:26:20</a>]  We were at this Irish bar, Irish pub.

[<a id="00-26-23">00:26:23</a>]  That's right.

[<a id="00-26-23">00:26:23</a>]  Okay, now I remember, we were talking like an hour or two.

[<a id="00-26-27">00:26:27</a>]  And then I think the next day or that we just met up at Starbucks, you were heading off

[<a id="00-26-33">00:26:33</a>]  somewhere.

[<a id="00-26-33">00:26:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-34">00:26:34</a>]  Okay, now I remember.

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  Somewhere there's an audio podcast, but it was...

[<a id="00-26-40">00:26:40</a>]  To me, I really enjoyed the conversation we had at that podcast because it's like...

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  I don't even remember what we talked about.

[<a id="00-26-45">00:26:45</a>]  I don't really remember either, but it was just...

[<a id="00-26-48">00:26:48</a>]  There was a bunch of things about the things we were talking about where it's like, "Oh,

[<a id="00-26-52">00:26:52</a>]  it's like one old dude to another, we get something."

[<a id="00-26-58">00:26:58</a>]  And I think, I haven't seen you since then, I don't think, have I?

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  No, we...

[<a id="00-27-03">00:27:03</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-27-04">00:27:04</a>]  So, I got here because this year, I think ever since that, they were messaging back

[<a id="00-27-10">00:27:10</a>]  and forth.

[<a id="00-27-10">00:27:10</a>]  And I think maybe you mentioned early in the year like, "Oh, we were talking and why don't

[<a id="00-27-16">00:27:16</a>]  you come to Switzerland and do podcasting?"

[<a id="00-27-19">00:27:19</a>]  I wanted to come early in the year, but I just had a bunch of shit and finally was able

[<a id="00-27-22">00:27:22</a>]  to make up, showed up November 22nd.

[<a id="00-27-26">00:27:26</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-27-27">00:27:27</a>]  And well, and I like traveling this particular time of year because I don't like being in

[<a id="00-27-31">00:27:31</a>]  the States during Thanksgiving because I don't like hanging out with my family.

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  And when you don't hang out with your family, all your friends say, "Well, you have to come

[<a id="00-27-38">00:27:38</a>]  to my Thanksgiving."

[<a id="00-27-41">00:27:41</a>]  And now I'm dragging to someone else's family drama that I don't want to hear.

[<a id="00-27-44">00:27:44</a>]  And believe me, it doesn't make any sense.

[<a id="00-27-46">00:27:46</a>]  I like not being invited to these things because I don't want to hear all kinds of family...

[<a id="00-27-51">00:27:51</a>]  You know, because Thanksgiving is the time you're supposed to be thankful and spend time

[<a id="00-27-55">00:27:55</a>]  with your family, but that's not what happened a lot of times.

[<a id="00-27-57">00:27:57</a>]  They were bringing all the family grudges once a year.

[<a id="00-28-00">00:28:00</a>]  And like, "Don't drag me into this.

[<a id="00-28-02">00:28:02</a>]  I don't want to hear your family problems," you know?

[<a id="00-28-05">00:28:05</a>]  So for the last 21 years, I think 14, 15 of those years, I'm almost in like Europe or

[<a id="00-28-19">00:28:19</a>]  something because I don't like being...

[<a id="00-28-21">00:28:21</a>]  Now, Christmas you can't help anywhere.

[<a id="00-28-23">00:28:23</a>]  That's holiday everywhere in the world, minus maybe Muslim country or whatever, you know?

[<a id="00-28-28">00:28:28</a>]  So I'm glad I'm here and you want to talk to me about my previous job and things like

[<a id="00-28-37">00:28:37</a>]  that.

[<a id="00-28-37">00:28:37</a>]  I don't mind, but like it's like people doing premieres for movies, they get asked the same

[<a id="00-28-45">00:28:45</a>]  stupid question over and over.

[<a id="00-28-47">00:28:47</a>]  You get tired of answering them.

[<a id="00-28-48">00:28:48</a>]  And I'm not going to say anything like different or, you know, that's why...

[<a id="00-28-51">00:28:51</a>]  It's not that I want to talk about it, just I get tired of saying the same thing over

[<a id="00-28-56">00:28:56</a>]  and over again, you know?

[<a id="00-28-57">00:28:57</a>]  Yeah, I know what you mean.

[<a id="00-28-59">00:28:59</a>]  So I don't know how we're going to do this, but I asked him like, "Hey, before we do the

[<a id="00-29-04">00:29:04</a>]  first episode, can I just ask you a bunch of questions?"

[<a id="00-29-07">00:29:07</a>]  And I want to do it with a question, you know?

[<a id="00-29-08">00:29:08</a>]  Go ahead.

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  Quick time out.

[<a id="00-29-13">00:29:13</a>]  I want to get...

[<a id="00-29-13">00:29:13</a>]  You could just edit this anyway, right?

[<a id="00-29-20">00:29:20</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-29-20">00:29:20</a>]  Well, you know, I think...

[<a id="00-29-33">00:29:33</a>]  We still don't even know what this thing's going to be called and you guys could do whatever

[<a id="00-29-38">00:29:38</a>]  with it.

[<a id="00-29-38">00:29:38</a>]  I don't really care, but...

[<a id="00-29-40">00:29:40</a>]  So you were born in the UK.

[<a id="00-29-47">00:29:47</a>]  Where in the UK?

[<a id="00-29-49">00:29:49</a>]  I was born in Wiesbaden in Germany.

[<a id="00-29-51">00:29:51</a>]  My dad was German, near Frankfurt.

[<a id="00-29-55">00:29:55</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-29-55">00:29:55</a>]  There's a big US air base, or there used to be in Wiesbaden.

[<a id="00-30-00">00:30:00</a>]  And then with two of my parents' divorce and my mom, who's English, took us back to live.

[<a id="00-30-08">00:30:08</a>]  How did your mom meet your dad?

[<a id="00-30-13">00:30:13</a>]  So, from what I know, she'd studied history at Oxford, she is a smart lady.

[<a id="00-30-20">00:30:20</a>]  Or this university in the world, or up there.

[<a id="00-30-25">00:30:25</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-30-26">00:30:26</a>]  And then somehow she started working for the...

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  Yeah, this would be not possible at all now.

[<a id="00-30-33">00:30:33</a>]  She started working for the Encyclopedia Britannica, which is...

[<a id="00-30-37">00:30:37</a>]  What kind of history did she study?

[<a id="00-30-38">00:30:38</a>]  Was it European or something?

[<a id="00-30-41">00:30:41</a>]  That's a good question, I've never...

[<a id="00-30-43">00:30:43</a>]  You know, it's weird, these things you never really talk to your parents about.

[<a id="00-30-47">00:30:47</a>]  I heard bits of it when I was young, and now I'm busy with my life.

[<a id="00-30-51">00:30:51</a>]  I mean, if you don't mind, how old is your mom about?

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  She's in about 88 now, I think.

[<a id="00-30-57">00:30:57</a>]  That shows what a great son I am.

[<a id="00-31-01">00:31:01</a>]  I think how old she is.

[<a id="00-31-04">00:31:04</a>]  So she was going to Oxford in the late 50s, early 60s.

[<a id="00-31-07">00:31:07</a>]  Yeah, yeah, she was born right before World War II.

[<a id="00-31-12">00:31:12</a>]  And one of the things was her generation going through school, they were very...

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  For English, that is the first really problematic generation, because they all had like weird...

[<a id="00-31-28">00:31:28</a>]  I don't know, weird vibes, because they'd been through the war.

[<a id="00-31-35">00:31:35</a>]  And then they were super smart, but also very hard for the teachers to manage.

[<a id="00-31-44">00:31:44</a>]  What was your mom's class, like a middle class, lower class?

[<a id="00-31-50">00:31:50</a>]  There's more or less, so we were probably upper middle class.

[<a id="00-31-57">00:31:57</a>]  Oh, is that right?

[<a id="00-31-58">00:31:58</a>]  Because my grandfather, he was the bank manager of the Bank of England in Southampton,

[<a id="00-32-04">00:32:04</a>]  which was, it's like, Southampton is not a fantastic city, but he was the boss of the bank.

[<a id="00-32-13">00:32:13</a>]  So there was money around.

[<a id="00-32-14">00:32:14</a>]  So I gather your mother's side come from a pretty good educational background.

[<a id="00-32-22">00:32:22</a>]  I mean, because going to Oxford is a very, extremely prestigious place, as you know.

[<a id="00-32-27">00:32:27</a>]  And she probably made a lot of other future influential people as well going to Oxford.

[<a id="00-32-33">00:32:33</a>]  Oh yeah, she occasionally, when we would talk about this,

[<a id="00-32-36">00:32:36</a>]  she lives in Germany now with my brother, and I see her that often.

[<a id="00-32-41">00:32:41</a>]  But yeah, she met some Indian dude who was ended up very high up in Indian politics.

[<a id="00-32-50">00:32:50</a>]  I see.

[<a id="00-32-51">00:32:51</a>]  Was kind of her boyfriend for a bit.

[<a id="00-32-53">00:32:53</a>]  She may have been, I shouldn't say this, but she may have been a bit of a ho at Oxford.

[<a id="00-33-02">00:33:02</a>]  But she, but I don't know, it's like now, she talked a lot about--

[<a id="00-33-09">00:33:09</a>]  Most unlikely because these days, what to be a whole,

[<a id="00-33-14">00:33:14</a>]  these days are so different than say back then.

[<a id="00-33-16">00:33:16</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-33-17">00:33:17</a>]  Back then, just giving like a kiss or something, you know.

[<a id="00-33-20">00:33:20</a>]  Yeah, and so she talked about having different boyfriends.

[<a id="00-33-23">00:33:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-33-23">00:33:23</a>]  But how far that, I don't think it was, that would mean something different.

[<a id="00-33-29">00:33:29</a>]  But yeah, so she did that, then she got a job out of the university

[<a id="00-33-33">00:33:33</a>]  working for the Encyclopedia Britannica.

[<a id="00-33-36">00:33:36</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-33-36">00:33:36</a>]  And then I think she, I don't know why, but she got,

[<a id="00-33-40">00:33:40</a>]  I think she just got offered a job, a better paid job for a German encyclopedia in Wiesbaden.

[<a id="00-33-47">00:33:47</a>]  And then--

[<a id="00-33-49">00:33:49</a>]  That's where they, you know, parents met.

[<a id="00-33-52">00:33:52</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-33-52">00:33:52</a>]  I see.

[<a id="00-33-53">00:33:53</a>]  She was staying in like a rented flat and my German grandmother owned the building

[<a id="00-34-01">00:34:01</a>]  and that's how she met my dad.

[<a id="00-34-04">00:34:04</a>]  And what's your dad's background?

[<a id="00-34-05">00:34:05</a>]  Well, he's dead now since years.

[<a id="00-34-08">00:34:08</a>]  But he was like a sort of a jack of all trades type of guy.

[<a id="00-34-15">00:34:15</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-34-15">00:34:15</a>]  He worked a little bit as a solicitor, he was laying carpets.

[<a id="00-34-19">00:34:19</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-34-20">00:34:20</a>]  He did a bit of everything.

[<a id="00-34-22">00:34:22</a>]  And I mean, they're an interesting--

[<a id="00-34-27">00:34:27</a>]  I don't really know my German family that well because we moved when I was so young.

[<a id="00-34-33">00:34:33</a>]  I got to know him a bit when I was like 18, 19.

[<a id="00-34-36">00:34:36</a>]  But what I got from--

[<a id="00-34-39">00:34:39</a>]  Wait, so you didn't grow up with your dad?

[<a id="00-34-41">00:34:41</a>]  No, he stayed in Germany.

[<a id="00-34-43">00:34:43</a>]  Oh, I see.

[<a id="00-34-44">00:34:44</a>]  But what I got from the story of that is just like in England,

[<a id="00-34-51">00:34:51</a>]  because England didn't get invaded,

[<a id="00-34-53">00:34:53</a>]  there's somehow through the war that got bombed a lot.

[<a id="00-34-56">00:34:56</a>]  It was still a certain continuity.

[<a id="00-34-59">00:34:59</a>]  But in Germany, things got really messed up.

[<a id="00-35-02">00:35:02</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-35-02">00:35:02</a>]  Like in, you know, you'd have like some dad who'd show up 10 years

[<a id="00-35-11">00:35:11</a>]  after the end of the war having been released from a prison in Russia.

[<a id="00-35-15">00:35:15</a>]  Oh, that's right.

[<a id="00-35-16">00:35:16</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-35-16">00:35:16</a>]  And that wasn't the case in my family because--

[<a id="00-35-21">00:35:21</a>]  Your family's more on the western side.

[<a id="00-35-23">00:35:23</a>]  So, yeah.

[<a id="00-35-24">00:35:24</a>]  And generationally, none of the men lined up with the First or Second World War.

[<a id="00-35-30">00:35:30</a>]  So they were always either too young or too old.

[<a id="00-35-32">00:35:32</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-35-33">00:35:33</a>]  But it certainly, there's some bizarre stories.

[<a id="00-35-38">00:35:38</a>]  Like, I think my German grandmother--

[<a id="00-35-44">00:35:44</a>]  I get this from my brother.

[<a id="00-35-45">00:35:45</a>]  My brother's fascinated by history.

[<a id="00-35-48">00:35:48</a>]  Honestly, I don't really give a shit about that stuff.

[<a id="00-35-50">00:35:50</a>]  Like, I don't think about it much.

[<a id="00-35-51">00:35:51</a>]  Is he older or younger brother?

[<a id="00-35-52">00:35:52</a>]  He's eight years older than me.

[<a id="00-35-54">00:35:54</a>]  I see.

[<a id="00-35-55">00:35:55</a>]  And there was also, I also had a half-brother who drunk and smoked himself to death.

[<a id="00-36-01">00:36:01</a>]  I think my dad was a bit of a tough dude to be married to because he was so like,

[<a id="00-36-08">00:36:08</a>]  he was drinking a lot.

[<a id="00-36-09">00:36:09</a>]  I think he was violent towards my mom, which is why--

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  Well, may we remind the listeners that your dad grew up with the Great Depression in Germany.

[<a id="00-36-18">00:36:18</a>]  And this is not particularly a great time.

[<a id="00-36-20">00:36:20</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-36-21">00:36:21</a>]  And not to mention, Germans suffered humiliation in World War I.

[<a id="00-36-27">00:36:27</a>]  And they had just overwhelming burden to pay off at enemies that they fought.

[<a id="00-36-31">00:36:31</a>]  And hyperinflation, I can imagine, you know, I studied a little bit of economics.

[<a id="00-36-37">00:36:37</a>]  Hyperinflation is always a gift to dictators because if you have a fixed income from government,

[<a id="00-36-43">00:36:43</a>]  like old person, and all of a sudden, every day, your money is worth less and less,

[<a id="00-36-48">00:36:48</a>]  whenever you have some crazy person offering solutions like Hitler or Stalin or Mao,

[<a id="00-36-53">00:36:53</a>]  you end up going for these people, not because you're a evil person,

[<a id="00-36-56">00:36:56</a>]  but because you're afraid for your livelihood, you know, or your life.

[<a id="00-36-59">00:36:59</a>]  Yeah, that's actually really interesting you put it that way.

[<a id="00-37-03">00:37:03</a>]  Like if you think about it, because you read about that in history,

[<a id="00-37-06">00:37:06</a>]  but if I think like the money I get paid every month is like going downhill,

[<a id="00-37-12">00:37:12</a>]  and some dude is saying, "Hey, do this, like follow me.

[<a id="00-37-15">00:37:15</a>]  I'm going to make sure you keep your money."

[<a id="00-37-17">00:37:17</a>]  I'm like, "Fuck yes."

[<a id="00-37-18">00:37:18</a>]  Because I got kids to look after.

[<a id="00-37-20">00:37:20</a>]  And I think this is something that Democratic Party in the United States forgot,

[<a id="00-37-24">00:37:24</a>]  because recently, you know, they're trying to make all kinds of cultural issues as the topic,

[<a id="00-37-29">00:37:29</a>]  but at the end of the day, if you're poor, middle class,

[<a id="00-37-31">00:37:31</a>]  what is the biggest thing you're concerned about?

[<a id="00-37-33">00:37:33</a>]  Your livelihood, are you able to take care of yourself, your families, economic.

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  And whether you like Trump or not,

[<a id="00-37-38">00:37:38</a>]  most people live better economic condition prior to COVID, you know?

[<a id="00-37-41">00:37:41</a>]  So I think they forgot about that, you know?

[<a id="00-37-46">00:37:46</a>]  And I think, to call like,

[<a id="00-37-50">00:37:50</a>]  1980, I worked for Michael Dukakis campaign, Democratic nominee.

[<a id="00-37-54">00:37:54</a>]  You worked for this?

[<a id="00-37-55">00:37:55</a>]  I made him, I worked on it.

[<a id="00-37-57">00:37:57</a>]  I just graduated from high school.

[<a id="00-37-59">00:37:59</a>]  Because back then, I still care about working class because I grew up poor.

[<a id="00-38-03">00:38:03</a>]  And I thought I know how to pick a winner.

[<a id="00-38-07">00:38:07</a>]  No, I've been wrong every election, you know?

[<a id="00-38-10">00:38:10</a>]  But I think when Bill Clinton became president,

[<a id="00-38-15">00:38:15</a>]  this is the reason why so many people hate him, Republicans.

[<a id="00-38-19">00:38:19</a>]  Because, no question, Bill Clinton is a political genius.

[<a id="00-38-24">00:38:24</a>]  I mean, unbelievable performer and an intelligent guy.

[<a id="00-38-27">00:38:27</a>]  And he understand politics really well.

[<a id="00-38-29">00:38:29</a>]  He took all the good idea that Republican has,

[<a id="00-38-32">00:38:32</a>]  take it away and add it to his administration.

[<a id="00-38-36">00:38:36</a>]  And I don't know why Republicans are mad.

[<a id="00-38-38">00:38:38</a>]  He's giving less power to union, lower tax, international trade.

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  But I think they pay heavy price because they really throw

[<a id="00-38-50">00:38:50</a>]  working class under the bus, you know?

[<a id="00-38-52">00:38:52</a>]  And I think that's why when you call mega rally people racist, they're not racist.

[<a id="00-38-57">00:38:57</a>]  Some of them maybe.

[<a id="00-38-58">00:38:58</a>]  I mean, rich people are racist too.

[<a id="00-38-59">00:38:59</a>]  These are working class, they're just scared for their family.

[<a id="00-39-03">00:39:03</a>]  And Democrats just forgot about them.

[<a id="00-39-05">00:39:05</a>]  So they went to Trump's camp.

[<a id="00-39-07">00:39:07</a>]  Even though Trump probably not going to do anything for them either,

[<a id="00-39-11">00:39:11</a>]  but at least he listened to them, you know?

[<a id="00-39-14">00:39:14</a>]  You can't just ignore poor people that it's cool.

[<a id="00-39-16">00:39:16</a>]  Or expecting black people to keep voting for your party

[<a id="00-39-20">00:39:20</a>]  because taking people for granted, it's never good policy, you know?

[<a id="00-39-24">00:39:24</a>]  So yeah, I think I got an interesting angle on the Clinton thing.

[<a id="00-39-29">00:39:29</a>]  Okay, well first, yeah.

[<a id="00-39-31">00:39:31</a>]  So I used to know this guy who worked for,

[<a id="00-39-34">00:39:34</a>]  later on when I worked for the Clinton Foundation.

[<a id="00-39-37">00:39:37</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-39-37">00:39:37</a>]  I probably shouldn't mention his name because he may be, this is--

[<a id="00-39-42">00:39:42</a>]  Just don't mention it.

[<a id="00-39-44">00:39:44</a>]  And it's also a sort of name that might get people whacked like me or something.

[<a id="00-39-49">00:39:49</a>]  But he, because he ended up being involved

[<a id="00-39-51">00:39:51</a>]  in selling a Canadian nuclear power plant to a Russian oligarch.

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  Through the Clinton Foundation.

[<a id="00-39-58">00:39:58</a>]  And it was interesting that how I got to know him.

[<a id="00-40-01">00:40:01</a>]  I was still at university then and I had a lot of friends in London.

[<a id="00-40-07">00:40:07</a>]  I was at a university just outside.

[<a id="00-40-08">00:40:08</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-40-09">00:40:09</a>]  And these guys are at the London School of Economics.

[<a id="00-40-12">00:40:12</a>]  It was a good friend of mine who went.

[<a id="00-40-14">00:40:14</a>]  And I got to meet all these dudes who were then gonna become

[<a id="00-40-18">00:40:18</a>]  the future ambassadors for America and this kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-40-22">00:40:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-40-23">00:40:23</a>]  They were a mad bunch of people.

[<a id="00-40-24">00:40:24</a>]  And for them, London was a playground.

[<a id="00-40-29">00:40:29</a>]  They're getting their good master's degrees from the London School of Economics.

[<a id="00-40-33">00:40:33</a>]  Mick Jagger went there too.

[<a id="00-40-35">00:40:35</a>]  To the London School of Economics?

[<a id="00-40-36">00:40:36</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-40-37">00:40:37</a>]  I didn't know that.

[<a id="00-40-38">00:40:38</a>]  That's why Roland Stone is interesting to me

[<a id="00-40-41">00:40:41</a>]  because not only is he creative musically,

[<a id="00-40-44">00:40:44</a>]  performance-wise, acting and things like that,

[<a id="00-40-47">00:40:47</a>]  but he's one of the few of them with a really good head of business.

[<a id="00-40-50">00:40:50</a>]  Famously, when they were having tax issues,

[<a id="00-40-52">00:40:52</a>]  they moved to southern France.

[<a id="00-40-53">00:40:53</a>]  Remember that?

[<a id="00-40-54">00:40:54</a>]  And the girl that was hanging out yesterday,

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  she was telling me her best friend in Amsterdam

[<a id="00-41-01">00:41:01</a>]  worked for an accounting firm to take care of Mick Jagger's account.

[<a id="00-41-04">00:41:04</a>]  Wow.

[<a id="00-41-04">00:41:04</a>]  So yeah, he has a head for business, you know.

[<a id="00-41-07">00:41:07</a>]  But this was an interesting thing because, you know,

[<a id="00-41-12">00:41:12</a>]  you talk about conspiracies.

[<a id="00-41-14">00:41:14</a>]  In the end, a conspiracy is just a bunch of people that know each other.

[<a id="00-41-17">00:41:17</a>]  It's like you could say there's a comedy conspiracy.

[<a id="00-41-20">00:41:20</a>]  So for example, if I run a venue and we're good friends,

[<a id="00-41-24">00:41:24</a>]  I'm like, "Hey, Yoshi, come and do this show."

[<a id="00-41-26">00:41:26</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-41-27">00:41:27</a>]  So that's a form of conspiracy.

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  I'm doing you a favor because we like each other, whatever, or vice versa.

[<a id="00-41-34">00:41:34</a>]  What does that mean anyway?

[<a id="00-41-35">00:41:35</a>]  Like when you say conspiracy, like two or more people

[<a id="00-41-37">00:41:37</a>]  trying to do something without public knowing?

[<a id="00-41-43">00:41:43</a>]  I'm really not familiar with it because everybody keeps talking about it.

[<a id="00-41-47">00:41:47</a>]  I just use that word without really not knowing anything.

[<a id="00-41-50">00:41:50</a>]  Okay, context.

[<a id="00-41-54">00:41:54</a>]  I studied physics and physics is one of the greatest.

[<a id="00-41-58">00:41:58</a>]  But once we finish, we should go back to your background, you know?

[<a id="00-42-00">00:42:00</a>]  All right, yeah.

[<a id="00-42-01">00:42:01</a>]  But I mean, this is part of the background.

[<a id="00-42-03">00:42:03</a>]  I study physics and physics teaches you systems thinking.

[<a id="00-42-07">00:42:07</a>]  Physics is a very good set of mental tools for analyzing stuff.

[<a id="00-42-14">00:42:14</a>]  So when I say I have a theory, that means I've thought this stuff through.

[<a id="00-42-21">00:42:21</a>]  I've got a theory of why they really took down Julian Assange.

[<a id="00-42-26">00:42:26</a>]  And it wasn't so much the leaks as the idea behind WikiLeaks.

[<a id="00-42-33">00:42:33</a>]  And he published this master's paper.

[<a id="00-42-36">00:42:36</a>]  So I've worked in software all my life.

[<a id="00-42-38">00:42:38</a>]  He created a definition of a conspiracy that a computer scientist understands.

[<a id="00-42-43">00:42:43</a>]  I want to hear it.

[<a id="00-42-44">00:42:44</a>]  And he says, basically, a conspiracy is a bit like the internet.

[<a id="00-42-50">00:42:50</a>]  Like the internet is made up of all these routers that are connected to each other,

[<a id="00-42-55">00:42:55</a>]  sharing data, and a conspiracy is a similar thing.

[<a id="00-42-59">00:42:59</a>]  It's a bunch of people that are acting in a certain way towards a certain agenda.

[<a id="00-43-04">00:43:04</a>]  The reason why I think they took him down-- you can find this thing online still--

[<a id="00-43-10">00:43:10</a>]  is he said, just like a computer network, where you can--

[<a id="00-43-15">00:43:15</a>]  there's certain ways to attack a computer network by overloading parts of the network.

[<a id="00-43-20">00:43:20</a>]  He published this manifesto, which is like, here's how you take down a conspiracy theory.

[<a id="00-43-27">00:43:27</a>]  Is you get the different actors in the conspiracy to stop trusting each other

[<a id="00-43-33">00:43:33</a>]  so that they overload each other.

[<a id="00-43-35">00:43:35</a>]  Wait, so if that group of people believe in conspiracy A,

[<a id="00-43-40">00:43:40</a>]  you create a problem within that group?

[<a id="00-43-44">00:43:44</a>]  Basically, yeah.

[<a id="00-43-45">00:43:45</a>]  For him, a conspiracy is like-- I don't know.

[<a id="00-43-49">00:43:49</a>]  You're trying to steal everybody's money around the world.

[<a id="00-43-54">00:43:54</a>]  And you're a bunch of people.

[<a id="00-43-55">00:43:55</a>]  You don't really like each other, but you work together towards a common goal.

[<a id="00-44-02">00:44:02</a>]  You're trying to keep it hidden.

[<a id="00-44-03">00:44:03</a>]  Now, what he did-- the greatest example of this was when he did the embassy leaks.

[<a id="00-44-11">00:44:11</a>]  Do you remember the-- so the embassy leaks really leaked a bunch of US diplomatic cables.

[<a id="00-44-17">00:44:17</a>]  There was the other leaks that were more famous, but this one--

[<a id="00-44-21">00:44:21</a>]  Hillary Clinton was US foreign secretary at the time.

[<a id="00-44-26">00:44:26</a>]  If she spent a year running around the world apologizing to every nation,

[<a id="00-44-32">00:44:32</a>]  or at least forcing them to get back on board, because--

[<a id="00-44-37">00:44:37</a>]  Apologizing about what?

[<a id="00-44-39">00:44:39</a>]  Because what Julian Assange leaked was all the shit that people--

[<a id="00-44-44">00:44:44</a>]  the US embassy system had been talking about different countries.

[<a id="00-44-48">00:44:48</a>]  Oh, and they were talking about a shit vehicle, but--

[<a id="00-44-51">00:44:51</a>]  Yeah, not just being assholes.

[<a id="00-44-53">00:44:53</a>]  It's like, here's how we're going to fuck these guys.

[<a id="00-44-55">00:44:55</a>]  And he leaked all of that stuff.

[<a id="00-44-58">00:44:58</a>]  And it was like countries that regarded themselves as US allies were finding out,

[<a id="00-45-05">00:45:05</a>]  hey, the Americans are doing this.

[<a id="00-45-07">00:45:07</a>]  And Julian Assange's goal in this was to-- and he did it.

[<a id="00-45-13">00:45:13</a>]  For about two years, there was no time for America to start a new war.

[<a id="00-45-19">00:45:19</a>]  Because the whole foreign system was tied up in cleaning out the mess that he caused.

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  So this is a completely opposite situation right after 9/11.

[<a id="00-45-32">00:45:32</a>]  The whole world wanted to help America.

[<a id="00-45-33">00:45:33</a>]  Of course, that idiots squandered at Goodwill

[<a id="00-45-37">00:45:37</a>]  and started killing people in Afghanistan and Iraq.

[<a id="00-45-40">00:45:40</a>]  Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-45-40">00:45:40</a>]  But it's basically what Julian Assange described.

[<a id="00-45-48">00:45:48</a>]  It's like a hacker's attack for how to bring down powerful systems.

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  And it works.

[<a id="00-45-57">00:45:57</a>]  And if more people knew about it, who have brains,

[<a id="00-46-02">00:46:02</a>]  we could basically eliminate power structures.

[<a id="00-46-07">00:46:07</a>]  But isn't it interesting when you have something like Paradise Paper?

[<a id="00-46-10">00:46:10</a>]  And there was a lady named Daphne,

[<a id="00-46-13">00:46:13</a>]  something from the island in the middle of the Mediterranean.

[<a id="00-46-18">00:46:18</a>]  Not Epstein's Island.

[<a id="00-46-23">00:46:23</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-46-24">00:46:24</a>]  It's an island where--

[<a id="00-46-26">00:46:26</a>]  Oh, Mediterranean.

[<a id="00-46-27">00:46:27</a>]  Oh, with the English Gibraltar.

[<a id="00-46-30">00:46:30</a>]  Malta.

[<a id="00-46-31">00:46:31</a>]  Malta.

[<a id="00-46-32">00:46:32</a>]  Yeah, I was there too.

[<a id="00-46-32">00:46:32</a>]  And she was assassinated because she participated in Paradise Paper

[<a id="00-46-39">00:46:39</a>]  about findings and things like that.

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  But it's really interesting because it was--

[<a id="00-46-42">00:46:42</a>]  Paradise Paper or Panama Paper?

[<a id="00-46-44">00:46:44</a>]  There's both.

[<a id="00-46-45">00:46:45</a>]  There's two of them.

[<a id="00-46-46">00:46:46</a>]  Oh, the Paradise Paper, I don't know about.

[<a id="00-46-47">00:46:47</a>]  I don't want to say some of the names

[<a id="00-46-51">00:46:51</a>]  because they're friends with Russell Peters.

[<a id="00-46-52">00:46:52</a>]  But these important people representing certain countries

[<a id="00-46-57">00:46:57</a>]  have access to an amount of money.

[<a id="00-46-58">00:46:58</a>]  And they turn around and go to different parts of the world

[<a id="00-47-00">00:47:00</a>]  buying property for themselves.

[<a id="00-47-01">00:47:01</a>]  And that was released.

[<a id="00-47-02">00:47:02</a>]  And you expect certain subjects to live in your country.

[<a id="00-47-09">00:47:09</a>]  They're poor, expecting the king or whoever it is to care for them.

[<a id="00-47-14">00:47:14</a>]  But they're spending money like crazy overseas.

[<a id="00-47-16">00:47:16</a>]  Anyway, it's really embarrassing.

[<a id="00-47-18">00:47:18</a>]  But it always goes back to my background,

[<a id="00-47-20">00:47:20</a>]  which is how you discredit these people with conspiracy

[<a id="00-47-25">00:47:25</a>]  or explaining to the rest of the world

[<a id="00-47-27">00:47:27</a>]  these powerful people are doing something.

[<a id="00-47-28">00:47:28</a>]  You silence them through sex scandals

[<a id="00-47-32">00:47:32</a>]  or accuse them of sexual assault.

[<a id="00-47-34">00:47:34</a>]  It's the most common thing that regular people understand.

[<a id="00-47-37">00:47:37</a>]  Whether it's true or not, you call somebody a rapist,

[<a id="00-47-43">00:47:43</a>]  damage is done.

[<a id="00-47-46">00:47:46</a>]  But I noticed that sex allegations

[<a id="00-47-50">00:47:50</a>]  are one of the most cost-effective ways

[<a id="00-47-52">00:47:52</a>]  to discredit someone.

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  This is actually an interesting thing because in the--

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  I'm not saying it didn't happen.

[<a id="00-48-00">00:48:00</a>]  I'm not saying it did happen or it didn't happen.

[<a id="00-48-03">00:48:03</a>]  I'm just saying it's a powerful way to discredit someone.

[<a id="00-48-08">00:48:08</a>]  And I forgot there was some Russian revolutionary

[<a id="00-48-11">00:48:11</a>]  who said-- I'm paraphrasing.

[<a id="00-48-14">00:48:14</a>]  It's not only necessary to kill your enemies,

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  but you have to first dishonor them.

[<a id="00-48-18">00:48:18</a>]  In other words, you do more harm by--

[<a id="00-48-20">00:48:20</a>]  It's worse than death.

[<a id="00-48-22">00:48:22</a>]  You hurt their reputation.

[<a id="00-48-24">00:48:24</a>]  See, this is an interesting thing

[<a id="00-48-27">00:48:27</a>]  because I wonder now does anybody care about honor anymore?

[<a id="00-48-32">00:48:32</a>]  Like I was having this conversation earlier this week

[<a id="00-48-37">00:48:37</a>]  with a couple of people.

[<a id="00-48-38">00:48:38</a>]  I have to say I find it's funny with--

[<a id="00-48-40">00:48:40</a>]  Through comedy, I meet a lot of people younger than me.

[<a id="00-48-42">00:48:42</a>]  We are all fuckers.

[<a id="00-48-46">00:48:46</a>]  Yeah, and so this is how I stay cool and stay in touch.

[<a id="00-48-52">00:48:52</a>]  We're not cool.

[<a id="00-48-55">00:48:55</a>]  Yeah, we're fucking cool.

[<a id="00-48-58">00:48:58</a>]  Anyway, we're cooler than--

[<a id="00-48-59">00:48:59</a>]  One thing that surprises me, at least in Switzerland,

[<a id="00-49-07">00:49:07</a>]  is you meet someone who's like 25

[<a id="00-49-10">00:49:10</a>]  and within 15 minutes,

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  they're telling you about their personal BDSM fetishes.

[<a id="00-49-16">00:49:16</a>]  But to me, what seems to be a very big taboo

[<a id="00-49-20">00:49:20</a>]  amongst young people is to say,

[<a id="00-49-22">00:49:22</a>]  "I actually have genuine feelings for you."

[<a id="00-49-24">00:49:24</a>]  And it's like, but if so--

[<a id="00-49-29">00:49:29</a>]  I don't know, like--

[<a id="00-49-30">00:49:30</a>]  Say that again.

[<a id="00-49-31">00:49:31</a>]  You actually have genuine feelings for someone

[<a id="00-49-35">00:49:35</a>]  like, "I love you" or "I care about you."

[<a id="00-49-37">00:49:37</a>]  They say that or they can't say it?

[<a id="00-49-39">00:49:39</a>]  They can't say it.

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  To me, that feels like the biggest taboo.

[<a id="00-49-43">00:49:43</a>]  They sometimes pretend to say it

[<a id="00-49-46">00:49:46</a>]  with all kinds of things like, "Oh, I feel you, man."

[<a id="00-49-48">00:49:48</a>]  But that's bullshit.

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  I love this.

[<a id="00-49-50">00:49:50</a>]  And just hold your thought and finish what you have to say.

[<a id="00-49-53">00:49:53</a>]  But this is one of the reasons it changed my life

[<a id="00-49-58">00:49:58</a>]  because anyone who's listening today

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  is I don't know anything about you or myself.

[<a id="00-50-02">00:50:02</a>]  I work in adult business aka porn business full-time

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  and I was watching a lot of those movies

[<a id="00-50-08">00:50:08</a>]  and make sure they're presentable for DVDs

[<a id="00-50-10">00:50:10</a>]  and things like that.

[<a id="00-50-11">00:50:11</a>]  And part of the problem is like

[<a id="00-50-13">00:50:13</a>]  when you see naked people all the time

[<a id="00-50-15">00:50:15</a>]  and they're having sex,

[<a id="00-50-16">00:50:16</a>]  eventually you don't even notice it anymore

[<a id="00-50-19">00:50:19</a>]  because I've seen it so many times,

[<a id="00-50-20">00:50:20</a>]  there's nothing really special about that.

[<a id="00-50-22">00:50:22</a>]  You literally take intimacy out of the whole thing.

[<a id="00-50-26">00:50:26</a>]  I think probably like halfway through

[<a id="00-50-31">00:50:31</a>]  working for the company, Evil Angel,

[<a id="00-50-33">00:50:33</a>]  I was working for them.

[<a id="00-50-34">00:50:34</a>]  My friend Aiden, one of the directors still for Evil Angel,

[<a id="00-50-39">00:50:39</a>]  he started doing this behind the scene where,

[<a id="00-50-41">00:50:41</a>]  okay, the girls just have sex with a guy,

[<a id="00-50-43">00:50:43</a>]  showered, afterwards they're kind of having conversation.

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  It doesn't necessarily like performances.

[<a id="00-50-51">00:50:51</a>]  They just literally like talk to him for a long time.

[<a id="00-50-53">00:50:53</a>]  And I don't think he did it on purpose,

[<a id="00-50-56">00:50:56</a>]  but this is like the porn aversion

[<a id="00-50-58">00:50:58</a>]  what Joe Rogan's doing, which is like,

[<a id="00-51-01">00:51:01</a>]  yeah, you could watch somebody fuck for like 10,

[<a id="00-51-02">00:51:02</a>]  15, 20 minutes or whatever,

[<a id="00-51-04">00:51:04</a>]  but you don't really know them until you talk to them.

[<a id="00-51-06">00:51:06</a>]  And Aiden, there's something really interesting

[<a id="00-51-08">00:51:08</a>]  when you talk to these performers,

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  both men and women or transgender person,

[<a id="00-51-12">00:51:12</a>]  sometimes 30, 40, 50 minutes, even hour,

[<a id="00-51-15">00:51:15</a>]  kind of sitting in a couch talking about stuff

[<a id="00-51-17">00:51:17</a>]  and that was part of the behind the scenes.

[<a id="00-51-18">00:51:18</a>]  Really, when they have a good conversation,

[<a id="00-51-26">00:51:26</a>]  they're finding naked to me.

[<a id="00-51-28">00:51:28</a>]  Like being physical naked doesn't mean anything,

[<a id="00-51-30">00:51:30</a>]  but once they stop playing a character,

[<a id="00-51-34">00:51:34</a>]  a whore or stud,

[<a id="00-51-38">00:51:38</a>]  and they start talking as a person

[<a id="00-51-41">00:51:41</a>]  and they talk something personal about themselves

[<a id="00-51-43">00:51:43</a>]  and what led them to do porn,

[<a id="00-51-45">00:51:45</a>]  to me, that was the most interesting part of my job later on

[<a id="00-51-48">00:51:48</a>]  because you get kind of like,

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  a lot of my friends think that was a great job,

[<a id="00-51-55">00:51:55</a>]  you get to watch porn all the time.

[<a id="00-51-57">00:51:57</a>]  It's really exhausting after a while

[<a id="00-51-58">00:51:58</a>]  because I don't care what kind of wonderful fantasy you have,

[<a id="00-52-03">00:52:03</a>]  soon as you bring work and job into it,

[<a id="00-52-07">00:52:07</a>]  it's not fantasy anymore.

[<a id="00-52-08">00:52:08</a>]  It's just a miserable thing now.

[<a id="00-52-10">00:52:10</a>]  You gotta work and really,

[<a id="00-52-13">00:52:13</a>]  I think working for that business changed my life

[<a id="00-52-17">00:52:17</a>]  because I think you start seeing these people

[<a id="00-52-20">00:52:20</a>]  like the way they really are,

[<a id="00-52-22">00:52:22</a>]  'cause I think this is a complete different

[<a id="00-52-24">00:52:24</a>]  for like 99% of the concern of pornography.

[<a id="00-52-27">00:52:27</a>]  Like I knew these people

[<a id="00-52-29">00:52:29</a>]  and when something happened to them

[<a id="00-52-32">00:52:32</a>]  or when they passed away,

[<a id="00-52-34">00:52:34</a>]  and I know there's a lot of dark humor out there.

[<a id="00-52-36">00:52:36</a>]  Like my friends would tell me like,

[<a id="00-52-38">00:52:38</a>]  "Oh, X1C porn, I'm gonna watch your porn and jack up there."

[<a id="00-52-42">00:52:42</a>]  And I would never tell them not to do anything

[<a id="00-52-44">00:52:44</a>]  just 'cause I understand dark humor too,

[<a id="00-52-46">00:52:46</a>]  but it's a little different when you work in those movies,

[<a id="00-52-49">00:52:49</a>]  it's a little different when you knew them

[<a id="00-52-51">00:52:51</a>]  and it's a little different when you're close to them

[<a id="00-52-54">00:52:54</a>]  and see them passed away

[<a id="00-52-55">00:52:55</a>]  and you know their families and friends

[<a id="00-52-57">00:52:57</a>]  and things like that, you know?

[<a id="00-52-58">00:52:58</a>]  So it did a lot of weird things, I guess.

[<a id="00-53-03">00:53:03</a>]  It took me places that I wasn't expecting to.

[<a id="00-53-06">00:53:06</a>]  And when I did Enbro Show last year,

[<a id="00-53-10">00:53:10</a>]  the name of the show is adult content.

[<a id="00-53-12">00:53:12</a>]  And I think people thought it's all gonna be

[<a id="00-53-14">00:53:14</a>]  about pornographic stories,

[<a id="00-53-17">00:53:17</a>]  but it's misunderstanding of that phrase, adult content.

[<a id="00-53-21">00:53:21</a>]  I thought it means adult content,

[<a id="00-53-24">00:53:24</a>]  like how to be happy as an adult.

[<a id="00-53-25">00:53:25</a>]  And then it kind of become that

[<a id="00-53-29">00:53:29</a>]  because whether working at the retail store

[<a id="00-53-33">00:53:33</a>]  and talking to these customers,

[<a id="00-53-34">00:53:34</a>]  lonely people, a big chunk of it,

[<a id="00-53-37">00:53:37</a>]  life is a little more complicated.

[<a id="00-53-40">00:53:40</a>]  It's easy to just categorize and call everybody pervert.

[<a id="00-53-42">00:53:42</a>]  And I guess there's a big chunk of that too,

[<a id="00-53-47">00:53:47</a>]  but I think more than anything,

[<a id="00-53-49">00:53:49</a>]  I think vast majority of people

[<a id="00-53-51">00:53:51</a>]  who consume pornography are not pervert.

[<a id="00-53-53">00:53:53</a>]  I think they're very lonely people

[<a id="00-53-56">00:53:56</a>]  and they're having a hard time making connections.

[<a id="00-53-59">00:53:59</a>]  And it was a weirdly,

[<a id="00-54-04">00:54:04</a>]  it gave me opportunity to be decent to people,

[<a id="00-54-09">00:54:09</a>]  you know, because I'm not very decent

[<a id="00-54-10">00:54:10</a>]  to stand up comedy show at times

[<a id="00-54-12">00:54:12</a>]  because I do a lot of mean shit on stage a lot of time.

[<a id="00-54-15">00:54:15</a>]  But I think working at the porn shop,

[<a id="00-54-17">00:54:17</a>]  working at the convention floor,

[<a id="00-54-19">00:54:19</a>]  whenever I was helping television show,

[<a id="00-54-23">00:54:23</a>]  a movie show in Hollywood,

[<a id="00-54-24">00:54:24</a>]  I will show the side that public don't really see, you know?

[<a id="00-54-31">00:54:31</a>]  And I think, yeah, it changed my life, you know?

[<a id="00-54-36">00:54:36</a>]  - That's an interesting thing.

[<a id="00-54-38">00:54:38</a>]  - They were most, I like porn on people

[<a id="00-54-41">00:54:41</a>]  because when they're most naked to me,

[<a id="00-54-43">00:54:43</a>]  I don't care about the nudity and stuff.

[<a id="00-54-45">00:54:45</a>]  I'm sick of that shit, you know?

[<a id="00-54-47">00:54:47</a>]  But I think when I get to know them,

[<a id="00-54-48">00:54:48</a>]  you see them really different.

[<a id="00-54-51">00:54:51</a>]  They're just playing characters on the stage, really.

[<a id="00-54-53">00:54:53</a>]  - I mean, this is an interesting,

[<a id="00-54-56">00:54:56</a>]  you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-54-57">00:54:57</a>]  Think of, so let me build up to a question.

[<a id="00-55-00">00:55:00</a>]  - Like I said, this is like, you know,

[<a id="00-55-03">00:55:03</a>]  we didn't have a agenda, what we're gonna talk about.

[<a id="00-55-05">00:55:05</a>]  - Yeah, we just ramble at the place.

[<a id="00-55-07">00:55:07</a>]  Like, I started doing comedy about,

[<a id="00-55-10">00:55:10</a>]  it's now almost eight years and the first year-

[<a id="00-55-14">00:55:14</a>]  - Your life rises?

[<a id="00-55-15">00:55:15</a>]  - It was getting dumped by a Swiss woman,

[<a id="00-55-19">00:55:19</a>]  which, I mean, okay, it might be kind of midlife crisis.

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  There are other reasons, like I also wanted a social life,

[<a id="00-55-28">00:55:28</a>]  but it was just a point with like,

[<a id="00-55-30">00:55:30</a>]  like I just had this energy.

[<a id="00-55-33">00:55:33</a>]  I was so, there's so much like anger and confusion

[<a id="00-55-37">00:55:37</a>]  and other stuff.

[<a id="00-55-40">00:55:40</a>]  And I just need to let some energy out somewhere

[<a id="00-55-45">00:55:45</a>]  and like, yeah, anyway,

[<a id="00-55-47">00:55:47</a>]  that's a kind of a side quest if we go down there.

[<a id="00-55-52">00:55:52</a>]  But the first couple of years,

[<a id="00-55-55">00:55:55</a>]  I was very conflicted about how I felt

[<a id="00-55-59">00:55:59</a>]  about presenting myself on stage because-

[<a id="00-56-02">00:56:02</a>]  - What do you mean?

[<a id="00-56-04">00:56:04</a>]  - 'Cause you're opening yourself to a lot of judgment.

[<a id="00-56-11">00:56:11</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-56-11">00:56:11</a>]  - I mean, Patrice, I remember he has a,

[<a id="00-56-14">00:56:14</a>]  I think it was in the Mark Maron interview

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  where he talks about like, when you do comedy,

[<a id="00-56-19">00:56:19</a>]  it's like people see the laughter in this,

[<a id="00-56-22">00:56:22</a>]  but you gave a piece of your soul to all those people.

[<a id="00-56-26">00:56:26</a>]  - Yeah, something undeserving.

[<a id="00-56-29">00:56:29</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, and they're gonna go

[<a id="00-56-33">00:56:33</a>]  and make their interpretation of you.

[<a id="00-56-35">00:56:35</a>]  You've left something of yourself

[<a id="00-56-38">00:56:38</a>]  and it's nothing tangible,

[<a id="00-56-40">00:56:40</a>]  but it's still, you're in other people's heads.

[<a id="00-56-43">00:56:43</a>]  Like today we met this woman that I don't even,

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  I couldn't even remember her face.

[<a id="00-56-46">00:56:46</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-56-46">00:56:46</a>]  - But she's like, "Oh, Harry, I know."

[<a id="00-56-48">00:56:48</a>]  And I'm like, "Okay."

[<a id="00-56-49">00:56:49</a>]  But it was, for me, like it took a couple of years

[<a id="00-56-55">00:56:55</a>]  and it's just finally I just,

[<a id="00-56-57">00:56:57</a>]  the maths I did in my head is like,

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  I'm at a certain age, I don't give a shit.

[<a id="00-57-01">00:57:01</a>]  - Well, I mean, this is-

[<a id="00-57-03">00:57:03</a>]  - But to get to the question,

[<a id="00-57-05">00:57:05</a>]  like, is there a similar thing in porn?

[<a id="00-57-09">00:57:09</a>]  Like, the assumption I have is that a lot of people

[<a id="00-57-14">00:57:14</a>]  get into porn because of trauma,

[<a id="00-57-18">00:57:18</a>]  because it's an easy way to make money.

[<a id="00-57-21">00:57:21</a>]  So it's a mix of trauma and money.

[<a id="00-57-22">00:57:22</a>]  But then there's also this line of shame.

[<a id="00-57-28">00:57:28</a>]  Like, what is the journey into porn?

[<a id="00-57-33">00:57:33</a>]  Like you saw people, like was it...

[<a id="00-57-38">00:57:38</a>]  I mean, the common thing they keep saying

[<a id="00-57-40">00:57:40</a>]  that they want to explore their sexuality.

[<a id="00-57-42">00:57:42</a>]  - Yeah, I never bought that shit.

[<a id="00-57-43">00:57:43</a>]  It's empowerment.

[<a id="00-57-44">00:57:44</a>]  - Empowerment.

[<a id="00-57-45">00:57:45</a>]  - I'm sorry, but...

[<a id="00-57-47">00:57:47</a>]  - I'm sure it's true for some of them.

[<a id="00-57-53">00:57:53</a>]  And it is easy money, I guess,

[<a id="00-57-56">00:57:56</a>]  especially like 20 years ago

[<a id="00-57-58">00:57:58</a>]  when I started working for Evil Angel in 2003, 21 years ago.

[<a id="00-58-07">00:58:07</a>]  It was kind of, unless I got to know them,

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  you know, like, I mean, I take their words for what it is.

[<a id="00-58-14">00:58:14</a>]  When I talked to my friend, Peter Warren from AVN,

[<a id="00-58-20">00:58:20</a>]  he think 100% of all the performers, female especially,

[<a id="00-58-23">00:58:23</a>]  they've been molested.

[<a id="00-58-24">00:58:24</a>]  That's why they get into this.

[<a id="00-58-25">00:58:25</a>]  I don't know if it's that high,

[<a id="00-58-26">00:58:26</a>]  but whatever it is,

[<a id="00-58-30">00:58:30</a>]  I always try to have respect for them.

[<a id="00-58-32">00:58:32</a>]  And if they choose to, once they choose to do it,

[<a id="00-58-37">00:58:37</a>]  there's no point in trying to shame somebody.

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  You know, I work in the business, you know?

[<a id="00-58-40">00:58:40</a>]  - Oh, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-58-41">00:58:41</a>]  I mean, I think, yeah, my bullshit reaction is like,

[<a id="00-58-45">00:58:45</a>]  when I think of, like, what is the word empowerment?

[<a id="00-58-49">00:58:49</a>]  It's that you have actual power

[<a id="00-58-53">00:58:53</a>]  and maybe it feels like you have power

[<a id="00-58-57">00:58:57</a>]  if you're a porn star,

[<a id="00-58-59">00:58:59</a>]  but the real power is with whoever is making the big money.

[<a id="00-59-05">00:59:05</a>]  And then actual power in the world is with people

[<a id="00-59-09">00:59:09</a>]  that have guns on their side and soldiers.

[<a id="00-59-12">00:59:12</a>]  Like, so this word empowerment is like,

[<a id="00-59-15">00:59:15</a>]  it's kind of a lie in itself.

[<a id="00-59-17">00:59:17</a>]  - It's a little weird because I think,

[<a id="00-59-19">00:59:19</a>]  especially from like early '90s,

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  you know, after the Cold War ended,

[<a id="00-59-25">00:59:25</a>]  you have a lot of these Eastern European performers,

[<a id="00-59-28">00:59:28</a>]  you know, and they're doing a completely different thing

[<a id="00-59-30">00:59:30</a>]  'cause growing up in Europe,

[<a id="00-59-32">00:59:32</a>]  they don't have hang up about sex and nudity,

[<a id="00-59-34">00:59:34</a>]  but if they're from Eastern Europe

[<a id="00-59-36">00:59:36</a>]  and they're in porn back then,

[<a id="00-59-37">00:59:37</a>]  it's probably more like financial reasons, you know?

[<a id="00-59-39">00:59:39</a>]  'Cause a lot of money they got is just staggering

[<a id="00-59-41">00:59:41</a>]  'cause you could never make that kind of money in the States.

[<a id="00-59-44">00:59:44</a>]  So I think I had a tendency to

[<a id="00-59-47">00:59:47</a>]  more sympathetic to Eastern European performers

[<a id="00-59-54">00:59:54</a>]  because if you do it right,

[<a id="00-59-56">00:59:56</a>]  if you work long enough and save enough money,

[<a id="00-59-59">00:59:59</a>]  you could go back to Europe.

[<a id="01-00-00">01:00:00</a>]  It's a generational wealth.

[<a id="01-00-01">01:00:01</a>]  It could change your family's destiny, you know?

[<a id="01-00-05">01:00:05</a>]  But if you're living, if you're born in America

[<a id="01-00-07">01:00:07</a>]  and you have all these opportunities to get into porn,

[<a id="01-00-09">01:00:09</a>]  they get a little complicated, right?

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  You know, you could have gotten acting

[<a id="01-00-13">01:00:13</a>]  or got a degree and become a doctor or whatnot, you know?

[<a id="01-00-16">01:00:16</a>]  And, but at the end of the day,

[<a id="01-00-18">01:00:18</a>]  it's not really my place to ask them

[<a id="01-00-22">01:00:22</a>]  unless I got to know them

[<a id="01-00-23">01:00:23</a>]  because my job was basically post-production DVDs,

[<a id="01-00-26">01:00:26</a>]  you know, like I think 2003 to 2007,

[<a id="01-00-30">01:00:30</a>]  I probably saw a lot of performers showing up at the office,

[<a id="01-00-33">01:00:33</a>]  but by 2009 and 10,

[<a id="01-00-36">01:00:36</a>]  I hardly ever saw too many people showing up at the office,

[<a id="01-00-38">01:00:38</a>]  you know, 'cause by then,

[<a id="01-00-39">01:00:39</a>]  a lot of online stuff was changing the business,

[<a id="01-00-42">01:00:42</a>]  but it's so different now.

[<a id="01-00-45">01:00:45</a>]  It's a completely different business.

[<a id="01-00-46">01:00:46</a>]  I'm having a hard time reading

[<a id="01-00-48">01:00:48</a>]  and figuring out what's going on in the business, you know?

[<a id="01-00-50">01:00:50</a>]  It's a different animal, you know?

[<a id="01-00-52">01:00:52</a>]  - Yeah, like OnlyFans and stuff.

[<a id="01-00-54">01:00:54</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, the power has shifted away

[<a id="01-00-56">01:00:56</a>]  from production to porn girls, you know?

[<a id="01-00-58">01:00:58</a>]  Which is good.

[<a id="01-00-59">01:00:59</a>]  - Yeah, definitely.

[<a id="01-01-00">01:01:00</a>]  I mean, I send you that.

[<a id="01-01-01">01:01:01</a>]  I send you that thing.

[<a id="01-01-03">01:01:03</a>]  There's this lady blowing up on TikTok,

[<a id="01-01-05">01:01:05</a>]  Angela Blue or something.

[<a id="01-01-06">01:01:06</a>]  - Oh yeah, I find her a very attractive lady.

[<a id="01-01-09">01:01:09</a>]  - And she's very attractive,

[<a id="01-01-11">01:01:11</a>]  and she's kind of done the Andrew Tate approach.

[<a id="01-01-15">01:01:15</a>]  - She's trolling.

[<a id="01-01-16">01:01:16</a>]  - Exactly, she's trolling.

[<a id="01-01-18">01:01:18</a>]  She's saying, going around to schools,

[<a id="01-01-20">01:01:20</a>]  fucking 18-year-old boys.

[<a id="01-01-22">01:01:22</a>]  Now she's moved on to dance.

[<a id="01-01-24">01:01:24</a>]  She's like, come to this hotel if you're a dad.

[<a id="01-01-26">01:01:26</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-01-27">01:01:27</a>]  - I don't care if you're married,

[<a id="01-01-29">01:01:29</a>]  and then they make a video out of this.

[<a id="01-01-30">01:01:30</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-01-31">01:01:31</a>]  - And it's trolling, yeah,

[<a id="01-01-34">01:01:34</a>]  because everyone's like, it's causing a reaction.

[<a id="01-01-37">01:01:37</a>]  - Yeah, and to me, she's not a whore.

[<a id="01-01-40">01:01:40</a>]  To me, she's a smart businesswoman

[<a id="01-01-42">01:01:42</a>]  that she knows how to get attention, make money, you know?

[<a id="01-01-44">01:01:44</a>]  'Cause I think, you know, my personal opinion is like,

[<a id="01-01-47">01:01:47</a>]  you do things and it doesn't bother you,

[<a id="01-01-53">01:01:53</a>]  whether you become an actor or a comedian or a porn star,

[<a id="01-01-56">01:01:56</a>]  but you don't want your kids to do the same thing

[<a id="01-01-57">01:01:57</a>]  and go through the suffering, you know?

[<a id="01-01-59">01:01:59</a>]  But if you do it, if you become a porn star,

[<a id="01-02-01">01:02:01</a>]  you make millions of dollars,

[<a id="01-02-02">01:02:02</a>]  you lose maybe public respect for you,

[<a id="01-02-06">01:02:06</a>]  and people might think,

[<a id="01-02-07">01:02:07</a>]  doesn't think too much of you,

[<a id="01-02-10">01:02:10</a>]  but if you make enough money

[<a id="01-02-12">01:02:12</a>]  to take care of your family and kids

[<a id="01-02-13">01:02:13</a>]  for generations to come,

[<a id="01-02-14">01:02:14</a>]  you know, like, good for her, you know?

[<a id="01-02-17">01:02:17</a>]  I really think it depends on why you did it, really.

[<a id="01-02-21">01:02:21</a>]  - Yeah, I guess.

[<a id="01-02-23">01:02:23</a>]  I mean, it's not my place to tell them

[<a id="01-02-27">01:02:27</a>]  how to live their lives, you know?

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  I mean, I buy the frame that you mentioned,

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  said 100% have some kind of child.

[<a id="01-02-37">01:02:37</a>]  'Cause the thing is, I think for people,

[<a id="01-02-39">01:02:39</a>]  most people, the idea of,

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  like, or if I put it in, this is a male point of view,

[<a id="01-02-47">01:02:47</a>]  but like, in periods in my life

[<a id="01-02-51">01:02:51</a>]  where I've been like, fucking around, basically,

[<a id="01-02-54">01:02:54</a>]  with different women,

[<a id="01-02-56">01:02:56</a>]  there's a certain point where my body's just like,

[<a id="01-02-59">01:02:59</a>]  like, even my dick is like,

[<a id="01-03-01">01:03:01</a>]  dude, who the fuck is this?

[<a id="01-03-03">01:03:03</a>]  I'm not even interested.

[<a id="01-03-04">01:03:04</a>]  And just because it's like the intimacy,

[<a id="01-03-09">01:03:09</a>]  you get to know someone, you get some depth.

[<a id="01-03-12">01:03:12</a>]  That's like, I'm more turned on by someone

[<a id="01-03-15">01:03:15</a>]  that I've been with for six months,

[<a id="01-03-17">01:03:17</a>]  and then we know each other,

[<a id="01-03-19">01:03:19</a>]  physically we know each other,

[<a id="01-03-21">01:03:21</a>]  and then, yeah, and so sleeping around,

[<a id="01-03-26">01:03:26</a>]  it's like, it's confusing to the body.

[<a id="01-03-28">01:03:28</a>]  - It's confusing, but I've been telling you too,

[<a id="01-03-31">01:03:31</a>]  and I think the first couple,

[<a id="01-03-34">01:03:34</a>]  I don't know, maybe first time I told you, you laughed,

[<a id="01-03-35">01:03:35</a>]  but I think sex is really overrated, you know?

[<a id="01-03-39">01:03:39</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="01-03-40">01:03:40</a>]  - And when people say,

[<a id="01-03-44">01:03:44</a>]  you work in porn business for a long time,

[<a id="01-03-45">01:03:45</a>]  you know so many people in business,

[<a id="01-03-47">01:03:47</a>]  you must have a weird fetish,

[<a id="01-03-48">01:03:48</a>]  and I was thinking like,

[<a id="01-03-49">01:03:49</a>]  you know, these days my fetish is like,

[<a id="01-03-51">01:03:51</a>]  girls showing up on time,

[<a id="01-03-53">01:03:53</a>]  stop yelling at me, you know?

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  Stop nagging, those are the fetishes.

[<a id="01-03-59">01:03:59</a>]  You don't even have to take your clothes off.

[<a id="01-04-01">01:04:01</a>]  It's like, we're not gonna have a good sex anyway.

[<a id="01-04-03">01:04:03</a>]  I'm 55, wait, wait.

[<a id="01-04-04">01:04:04</a>]  You know, at a certain point, like,

[<a id="01-04-06">01:04:06</a>]  you know, it's just, it's grossly exaggerated,

[<a id="01-04-13">01:04:13</a>]  because after you have sex,

[<a id="01-04-14">01:04:14</a>]  like, God, all that hassle to get it,

[<a id="01-04-16">01:04:16</a>]  dinner, movies and stuff,

[<a id="01-04-18">01:04:18</a>]  it's just so much headache.

[<a id="01-04-20">01:04:20</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, it's actually,

[<a id="01-04-21">01:04:21</a>]  I love that point of view,

[<a id="01-04-23">01:04:23</a>]  'cause we were talking about that on the phone.

[<a id="01-04-25">01:04:25</a>]  I thought it's hilarious, because--

[<a id="01-04-27">01:04:27</a>]  - I'm trying not to be ironic, but like,

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  I know you, but you know, like--

[<a id="01-04-31">01:04:31</a>]  - But if I look back at my life,

[<a id="01-04-33">01:04:33</a>]  the amount of time and effort

[<a id="01-04-35">01:04:35</a>]  I've put into getting laid,

[<a id="01-04-37">01:04:37</a>]  and it's never been anything,

[<a id="01-04-40">01:04:40</a>]  okay, once or twice it's been like,

[<a id="01-04-42">01:04:42</a>]  okay, that was an interesting experience.

[<a id="01-04-44">01:04:44</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-04-45">01:04:45</a>]  - But generally speaking,

[<a id="01-04-46">01:04:46</a>]  it's never been worth the effort.

[<a id="01-04-48">01:04:48</a>]  It's like, and if I think about

[<a id="01-04-52">01:04:52</a>]  how much better my life would be

[<a id="01-04-54">01:04:54</a>]  if I hadn't had a dick chasing women around.

[<a id="01-04-56">01:04:56</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-04-57">01:04:57</a>]  - I mean, it's a paradox.

[<a id="01-04-59">01:04:59</a>]  I became a dad through that.

[<a id="01-05-00">01:05:00</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-05-01">01:05:01</a>]  - And when becoming a dad

[<a id="01-05-02">01:05:02</a>]  made me a much better person,

[<a id="01-05-06">01:05:06</a>]  like a much more able to handle stress,

[<a id="01-05-09">01:05:09</a>]  much less--

[<a id="01-05-10">01:05:10</a>]  - When you're caring for someone, sure.

[<a id="01-05-13">01:05:13</a>]  It has a civilizing effect, I think.

[<a id="01-05-14">01:05:14</a>]  - It, but it forced me to level up in big ways.

[<a id="01-05-19">01:05:19</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-05-19">01:05:19</a>]  - Because the first thing,

[<a id="01-05-22">01:05:22</a>]  and the first thing is just,

[<a id="01-05-24">01:05:24</a>]  I remember like with my daughter,

[<a id="01-05-27">01:05:27</a>]  I think, I know, she's like three months old.

[<a id="01-05-30">01:05:30</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-05-31">01:05:31</a>]  - And she's, you know, I'm lying next to her,

[<a id="01-05-35">01:05:35</a>]  she's asleep in bed,

[<a id="01-05-36">01:05:36</a>]  and I've just got this terror of like,

[<a id="01-05-39">01:05:39</a>]  fuck, I'm responsible for this life now.

[<a id="01-05-43">01:05:43</a>]  And it's like, that means I can't die.

[<a id="01-05-45">01:05:45</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-05-46">01:05:46</a>]  - I have to make sure this thing lives.

[<a id="01-05-49">01:05:49</a>]  And that's, and that was the first time

[<a id="01-05-52">01:05:52</a>]  I've ever had that kind of responsibility.

[<a id="01-05-54">01:05:54</a>]  But then the other side of that is

[<a id="01-05-57">01:05:57</a>]  I don't look after myself very well,

[<a id="01-06-00">01:06:00</a>]  or I don't even stand up for myself in most situations.

[<a id="01-06-05">01:06:05</a>]  Taking years to learn to,

[<a id="01-06-07">01:06:07</a>]  when someone's doing some bullshit towards me

[<a id="01-06-09">01:06:09</a>]  to say fuck off.

[<a id="01-06-10">01:06:10</a>]  But if somebody does the same shit to my kids,

[<a id="01-06-14">01:06:14</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-06-14">01:06:14</a>]  - I become a person who maybe would be willing to do anything.

[<a id="01-06-21">01:06:21</a>]  - Of course.

[<a id="01-06-22">01:06:22</a>]  - And to me, that's fascinating

[<a id="01-06-24">01:06:24</a>]  'cause it's this animal energy.

[<a id="01-06-26">01:06:26</a>]  It's like, oh, you fuck with my kids?

[<a id="01-06-28">01:06:28</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="01-06-29">01:06:29</a>]  - That's where it's like soprano level energy.

[<a id="01-06-32">01:06:32</a>]  And that's fascinating to me because,

[<a id="01-06-36">01:06:36</a>]  yeah, I don't know where I'm going with this now,

[<a id="01-06-40">01:06:40</a>]  but it's just like,

[<a id="01-06-41">01:06:41</a>]  I've benefited a lot from having kids

[<a id="01-06-44">01:06:44</a>]  because it made me maybe a more powerful human being.

[<a id="01-06-49">01:06:49</a>]  Because otherwise I would just have been gaming

[<a id="01-06-52">01:06:52</a>]  and doing bullshit.

[<a id="01-06-53">01:06:53</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-06-54">01:06:54</a>]  - And like, you know.

[<a id="01-06-56">01:06:56</a>]  - One of my friend, Tom,

[<a id="01-06-57">01:06:57</a>]  when I met him within five minutes,

[<a id="01-07-01">01:07:01</a>]  he was a friend of my other close friend

[<a id="01-07-03">01:07:03</a>]  and then my other friend knew

[<a id="01-07-06">01:07:06</a>]  Tom would just piss me off right away.

[<a id="01-07-10">01:07:10</a>]  So he delivered it by him knowing he's gonna piss me off

[<a id="01-07-13">01:07:13</a>]  and I fucking hated it.

[<a id="01-07-14">01:07:14</a>]  But after he got married and had kids,

[<a id="01-07-16">01:07:16</a>]  he had a civilized effect.

[<a id="01-07-17">01:07:17</a>]  He's a good man.

[<a id="01-07-18">01:07:18</a>]  He's a good father, good husband.

[<a id="01-07-20">01:07:20</a>]  And it kind of shocked him

[<a id="01-07-21">01:07:21</a>]  because I never thought he had it in him to do that.

[<a id="01-07-23">01:07:23</a>]  But, you know, marriage for some people really works.

[<a id="01-07-27">01:07:27</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-07-28">01:07:28</a>]  - Like having kids for people works, you know?

[<a id="01-07-31">01:07:31</a>]  - All right, difficult question.

[<a id="01-07-34">01:07:34</a>]  What's the thing that pisses you off?

[<a id="01-07-38">01:07:38</a>]  What do you do when you get pissed off?

[<a id="01-07-40">01:07:40</a>]  Like, how did Tom piss you off?

[<a id="01-07-42">01:07:42</a>]  - Oh, it's been, oh, he was just like,

[<a id="01-07-45">01:07:45</a>]  started mocking me and just harassing me right away.

[<a id="01-07-48">01:07:48</a>]  But I don't remember exactly all the detail.

[<a id="01-07-51">01:07:51</a>]  All I remember at the time, just like 90 or 91,

[<a id="01-07-56">01:07:56</a>]  I just met him.

[<a id="01-07-57">01:07:57</a>]  My friend Fred was giggling

[<a id="01-07-59">01:07:59</a>]  'cause he knew Tom's gonna irritate me.

[<a id="01-08-01">01:08:01</a>]  He just wanted to bring him and introduce me

[<a id="01-08-03">01:08:03</a>]  so he'll irritate me.

[<a id="01-08-04">01:08:04</a>]  - Oh, so he's like one of these comedians that's on a permit.

[<a id="01-08-07">01:08:07</a>]  - No, they're not comedians.

[<a id="01-08-08">01:08:08</a>]  They were just regular guys.

[<a id="01-08-09">01:08:09</a>]  - But you know, you get, I don't mean,

[<a id="01-08-11">01:08:11</a>]  but he was like he's on a permanent roast battle.

[<a id="01-08-13">01:08:13</a>]  So he's roasting.

[<a id="01-08-14">01:08:14</a>]  - He was just, Tom was being a dick at the time, you know?

[<a id="01-08-16">01:08:16</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="01-08-17">01:08:17</a>]  - And my whole reaction at the time was,

[<a id="01-08-19">01:08:19</a>]  I'm just gonna get a pencil, just stab me in the eye.

[<a id="01-08-21">01:08:21</a>]  That was my reaction.

[<a id="01-08-24">01:08:24</a>]  But it's amazing, his daughter just had a daughter.

[<a id="01-08-28">01:08:28</a>]  So he's a grandfather now.

[<a id="01-08-29">01:08:29</a>]  - Holy shit.

[<a id="01-08-31">01:08:31</a>]  - Among my friends, among my friends,

[<a id="01-08-34">01:08:34</a>]  I think he's the first grandfather.

[<a id="01-08-36">01:08:36</a>]  Kind of weirdly weird to say that.

[<a id="01-08-38">01:08:38</a>]  - Do you have kids?

[<a id="01-08-40">01:08:40</a>]  - No, no, no, I don't have kids.

[<a id="01-08-41">01:08:41</a>]  - 'Cause you strike me as someone,

[<a id="01-08-46">01:08:46</a>]  there might be 50 kids around the world.

[<a id="01-08-49">01:08:49</a>]  - No, no, no.

[<a id="01-08-50">01:08:50</a>]  I had an inkling early on that I'll be a terrible father

[<a id="01-08-57">01:08:57</a>]  and I don't have a very close relationship with my parents.

[<a id="01-09-00">01:09:00</a>]  They're not bad people, but they were not good parents.

[<a id="01-09-02">01:09:02</a>]  And I'm not a good son either.

[<a id="01-09-04">01:09:04</a>]  But good parenting, it's like pornography,

[<a id="01-09-09">01:09:09</a>]  you know it when you see it, right?

[<a id="01-09-10">01:09:10</a>]  And then my mother was basically,

[<a id="01-09-14">01:09:14</a>]  I think she was kind of pushed to marry my dad.

[<a id="01-09-17">01:09:17</a>]  So I think, it's not a fun thing to say,

[<a id="01-09-21">01:09:21</a>]  but I think every time she saw me,

[<a id="01-09-23">01:09:23</a>]  it reminded her of happiness.

[<a id="01-09-26">01:09:26</a>]  So she's a very atypical Asian mother

[<a id="01-09-30">01:09:30</a>]  because most Asian mothers were sacrificing their lives

[<a id="01-09-32">01:09:32</a>]  for their kids, she was complete opposite.

[<a id="01-09-34">01:09:34</a>]  She just didn't give a shit about that, you know?

[<a id="01-09-36">01:09:36</a>]  She was drinking a lot too.

[<a id="01-09-38">01:09:38</a>]  - You reminded me of the, okay,

[<a id="01-09-42">01:09:42</a>]  I refer to her as laws and ladies,

[<a id="01-09-45">01:09:45</a>]  the crazy one that I met before I met you.

[<a id="01-09-48">01:09:48</a>]  And this is a conversation she had as well.

[<a id="01-09-52">01:09:52</a>]  It's like, I don't wanna have children

[<a id="01-09-54">01:09:54</a>]  'cause I don't want this line to continue

[<a id="01-09-58">01:09:58</a>]  because like there is a fucked upness in this family

[<a id="01-10-02">01:10:02</a>]  that I don't wanna pass on to.

[<a id="01-10-04">01:10:04</a>]  - I mean, I guess technically somebody could ask me like,

[<a id="01-10-07">01:10:07</a>]  could you move away and not do what your parents did?

[<a id="01-10-12">01:10:12</a>]  But the reality is I am my dad and my mother's son.

[<a id="01-10-16">01:10:16</a>]  - So you're making a Darwinian choice

[<a id="01-10-18">01:10:18</a>]  for the human race in a way.

[<a id="01-10-19">01:10:19</a>]  - I don't take pleasure hurting people

[<a id="01-10-25">01:10:25</a>]  and I feel a little weird about bringing a life

[<a id="01-10-32">01:10:32</a>]  and not for family.

[<a id="01-10-34">01:10:34</a>]  So I had a vasectomy in like late 90s.

[<a id="01-10-37">01:10:37</a>]  So that guaranteed that I'm not gonna have kids.

[<a id="01-10-40">01:10:40</a>]  I mean, there's times when I see a couple

[<a id="01-10-42">01:10:42</a>]  of my friend's kids like, well, they're amazing kids.

[<a id="01-10-44">01:10:44</a>]  It doesn't make me think like it would have been wonderful

[<a id="01-10-46">01:10:46</a>]  to have a kid 'cause they're such a sweet kids, you know?

[<a id="01-10-48">01:10:48</a>]  My friend, Mikey, his daughter, Gabby,

[<a id="01-10-53">01:10:53</a>]  second kid in the family and she's a beautiful girl,

[<a id="01-10-58">01:10:58</a>]  very funny, but she makes me laugh

[<a id="01-11-01">01:11:01</a>]  because she does gymnastic

[<a id="01-11-03">01:11:03</a>]  and their coach is a gay black guy.

[<a id="01-11-06">01:11:06</a>]  - I don't know why that's funny, but it makes me laugh.

[<a id="01-11-10">01:11:10</a>]  A gay black coach teaching ballet.

[<a id="01-11-13">01:11:13</a>]  - Gymnastic and I don't remember what he said,

[<a id="01-11-19">01:11:19</a>]  perfection or, you know, you have to do the drill better

[<a id="01-11-26">01:11:26</a>]  or, you know, I don't know what he said,

[<a id="01-11-32">01:11:32</a>]  but she turned around and said,

[<a id="01-11-35">01:11:35</a>]  "Oh, you mean like you're losing your hair

[<a id="01-11-38">01:11:38</a>]  in the middle of your..."

[<a id="01-11-39">01:11:39</a>]  Something about this gay black guy's look

[<a id="01-11-43">01:11:43</a>]  that he fought so hard to hide,

[<a id="01-11-46">01:11:46</a>]  but teenage girls are terrified

[<a id="01-11-48">01:11:48</a>]  because they know all your insecurity.

[<a id="01-11-50">01:11:50</a>]  She made this guy cry and most adults will say,

[<a id="01-11-56">01:11:56</a>]  "Gabby, that's terrible. I couldn't stop laughing.

[<a id="01-11-58">01:11:58</a>]  Good for you. I wish I had the money to give it to her."

[<a id="01-12-01">01:12:01</a>]  Yeah, go to the world and hurt people's feelings.

[<a id="01-12-05">01:12:05</a>]  That's what I was telling this girl.

[<a id="01-12-07">01:12:07</a>]  So if I had a daughter like that,

[<a id="01-12-08">01:12:08</a>]  oh my God, she's so sassy and sarcastic.

[<a id="01-12-12">01:12:12</a>]  I love kids like that,

[<a id="01-12-13">01:12:13</a>]  but boy, teenage kids are so good at detecting your weakness

[<a id="01-12-18">01:12:18</a>]  and they just stab you.

[<a id="01-12-21">01:12:21</a>]  But yeah, every time I see her or when Mikey told me,

[<a id="01-12-27">01:12:27</a>]  "Guess what my daughter did this week?

[<a id="01-12-28">01:12:28</a>]  I can't stop laughing."

[<a id="01-12-30">01:12:30</a>]  See, if I had a kid like that, good, fine.

[<a id="01-12-32">01:12:32</a>]  That's wonderful, you know?

[<a id="01-12-33">01:12:33</a>]  But knowing myself,

[<a id="01-12-35">01:12:35</a>]  I probably have some miserable prick as a kid

[<a id="01-12-37">01:12:37</a>]  because I was a miserable prick as a kid.

[<a id="01-12-40">01:12:40</a>]  - I mean, I guess, well, to apropo your point,

[<a id="01-12-44">01:12:44</a>]  like my daughter, I don't argue with my daughter anymore

[<a id="01-12-47">01:12:47</a>]  because...

[<a id="01-12-48">01:12:48</a>]  - Never fight a war you can't win.

[<a id="01-12-51">01:12:51</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="01-12-52">01:12:52</a>]  - She's 11 and a bit, a teenage girl.

[<a id="01-12-54">01:12:54</a>]  - Well, she's 21 now.

[<a id="01-12-56">01:12:56</a>]  She knows all my insecurities at a primal level.

[<a id="01-13-03">01:13:03</a>]  She's grown up with them from the age of a kid.

[<a id="01-13-07">01:13:07</a>]  And like a two-year-old, they don't listen to anything you say.

[<a id="01-13-11">01:13:11</a>]  They read you, they read your soul.

[<a id="01-13-14">01:13:14</a>]  - She's like Scientology.

[<a id="01-13-16">01:13:16</a>]  She knows your dark secret, know how to exploit you.

[<a id="01-13-18">01:13:18</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="01-13-19">01:13:19</a>]  - And you know, when the fights begin,

[<a id="01-13-22">01:13:22</a>]  she'll press something and it's like, "Oh, man."

[<a id="01-13-26">01:13:26</a>]  - She remembers.

[<a id="01-13-27">01:13:27</a>]  - But that's just like...

[<a id="01-13-29">01:13:29</a>]  But the thing is, yeah, I don't know.

[<a id="01-13-34">01:13:34</a>]  I guess the thing that people should know about parenting

[<a id="01-13-39">01:13:39</a>]  is that when, especially when they're young,

[<a id="01-13-41">01:13:41</a>]  this is, like I was thinking about

[<a id="01-13-43">01:13:43</a>]  why does so many people fuck up as parents?

[<a id="01-13-45">01:13:45</a>]  I think mostly I didn't fuck up

[<a id="01-13-48">01:13:48</a>]  and because I looked at where I was in my life,

[<a id="01-13-52">01:13:52</a>]  I'm like, this is the one thing I'm determined not to fuck this up.

[<a id="01-13-57">01:13:57</a>]  And the early stages where the kids up to the age of about eight,

[<a id="01-14-03">01:14:03</a>]  it's like going back to stone age times.

[<a id="01-14-08">01:14:08</a>]  So we live in this beautiful modern world

[<a id="01-14-11">01:14:11</a>]  where you can get a green tea frappuccino and this kind of stuff,

[<a id="01-14-14">01:14:14</a>]  but then you have kids and you're wiping human shit off every day.

[<a id="01-14-19">01:14:19</a>]  You're dealing with this thing that screams.

[<a id="01-14-22">01:14:22</a>]  - Who's older, a boy or a girl?

[<a id="01-14-24">01:14:24</a>]  - The girl is older.

[<a id="01-14-25">01:14:25</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="01-14-25">01:14:25</a>]  - Thank God, it's better to have an older daughter

[<a id="01-14-28">01:14:28</a>]  because she sets a more calm tone.

[<a id="01-14-31">01:14:31</a>]  And then you're woken up.

[<a id="01-14-34">01:14:34</a>]  Like there was three years where I got maximum like three hours sleep a night

[<a id="01-14-40">01:14:40</a>]  because my daughter would wake up crying or my son.

[<a id="01-14-44">01:14:44</a>]  And I remember this one time, it's summertime, it's hot, it's 3 a.m.

[<a id="01-14-51">01:14:51</a>]  I'm like a zombie.

[<a id="01-14-53">01:14:53</a>]  My daughter woke up, she's crying.

[<a id="01-14-56">01:14:56</a>]  I'm rocking her in my arms back to sleep

[<a id="01-14-59">01:14:59</a>]  and I'm stood in front of this window because it's hot

[<a id="01-15-01">01:15:01</a>]  and it's like some cool air blowing in.

[<a id="01-15-03">01:15:03</a>]  And then this little voice in my head says,

[<a id="01-15-07">01:15:07</a>]  dude, the window's right there.

[<a id="01-15-09">01:15:09</a>]  You can solve this problem right now.

[<a id="01-15-11">01:15:11</a>]  Just like, yeah, shut the window.

[<a id="01-15-15">01:15:15</a>]  And I was horrified that that creature existed in me.

[<a id="01-15-21">01:15:21</a>]  And that's like the nature of the human soul.

[<a id="01-15-26">01:15:26</a>]  And so you get brought with small children,

[<a id="01-15-28">01:15:28</a>]  they bring you to the most animal level.

[<a id="01-15-31">01:15:31</a>]  - Which led to Louis C.K.'s success in the beginning

[<a id="01-15-35">01:15:35</a>]  because one of the things that really changed his career,

[<a id="01-15-38">01:15:38</a>]  he was saying something about seeing a parent punching a kid

[<a id="01-15-44">01:15:44</a>]  or hurting a kid.

[<a id="01-15-46">01:15:46</a>]  And if you didn't have a kid, you would say that's terrible.

[<a id="01-15-50">01:15:50</a>]  But as a father, he said, I understand.

[<a id="01-15-52">01:15:52</a>]  And then the audience laughed.

[<a id="01-15-53">01:15:53</a>]  You know, that kind of like nuanced honesty

[<a id="01-15-58">01:15:58</a>]  is what led to Louis' success, you know?

[<a id="01-16-00">01:16:00</a>]  I think, yeah.

[<a id="01-16-02">01:16:02</a>]  - Because, and it's, I mean, to me, that's always a thing.

[<a id="01-16-07">01:16:07</a>]  I think like there's a point, in my brain,

[<a id="01-16-10">01:16:10</a>]  it's like, it's somewhere between 30 and 40,

[<a id="01-16-13">01:16:13</a>]  most people discover that they're not a nice person.

[<a id="01-16-16">01:16:16</a>]  And up until 30, most people are living in a bubble of,

[<a id="01-16-22">01:16:22</a>]  I'm a nice person, I do good.

[<a id="01-16-24">01:16:24</a>]  And they, ignoring all the times,

[<a id="01-16-26">01:16:26</a>]  they do shitty things to people.

[<a id="01-16-28">01:16:28</a>]  And then you've got a nice Jungian shadow self.

[<a id="01-16-34">01:16:34</a>]  It's about creating unity between your good and your bad,

[<a id="01-16-36">01:16:36</a>]  whatever. - This is funny coming from you

[<a id="01-16-38">01:16:38</a>]  because he was living in Switzerland as well.

[<a id="01-16-40">01:16:40</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="01-16-42">01:16:42</a>]  I mean, I haven't, and this is coming from a point

[<a id="01-16-48">01:16:48</a>]  of arrogance and not a lot of, but being a physicist,

[<a id="01-16-52">01:16:52</a>]  I think psychology, fundamentally,

[<a id="01-16-54">01:16:54</a>]  I believe psychology is bullshit.

[<a id="01-16-56">01:16:56</a>]  I think it's, I think, I mean, I grew up in England

[<a id="01-17-02">01:17:02</a>]  and we used to laugh about how all the Americans

[<a id="01-17-06">01:17:06</a>]  need to see a therapist.

[<a id="01-17-07">01:17:07</a>]  - Yes. - It was, and it wasn't,

[<a id="01-17-09">01:17:09</a>]  yeah, it's like a-- - I could be wrong,

[<a id="01-17-16">01:17:16</a>]  but one of my understanding why Stalin hated Jews,

[<a id="01-17-19">01:17:19</a>]  one of many reasons, but I think one of the things

[<a id="01-17-22">01:17:22</a>]  that he really hated for psychotherapy,

[<a id="01-17-25">01:17:25</a>]  which is like a religion for some Jewish people.

[<a id="01-17-28">01:17:28</a>]  - And it's become a global religion now.

[<a id="01-17-30">01:17:30</a>]  - Yeah, because I think to Stalin it was a dangerous thing

[<a id="01-17-34">01:17:34</a>]  that people get into his head, you know, and I think--

[<a id="01-17-37">01:17:37</a>]  - Yeah, but also the thing is the brain is,

[<a id="01-17-41">01:17:41</a>]  the brain is not subtractive, it's only additive.

[<a id="01-17-44">01:17:44</a>]  - What does that mean? - So if I say to you,

[<a id="01-17-48">01:17:48</a>]  don't think of a huge black cock right now.

[<a id="01-17-51">01:17:51</a>]  - Yeah. - Yeah, you can't not do things.

[<a id="01-17-55">01:17:55</a>]  - Well, this is a little tricky

[<a id="01-17-56">01:17:56</a>]  because I'm always thinking about that.

[<a id="01-17-58">01:17:58</a>]  - Exactly, don't think of an elephant.

[<a id="01-18-01">01:18:01</a>]  It's like, so you can't unthink.

[<a id="01-18-05">01:18:05</a>]  - Yeah. - You can only add more bullshit.

[<a id="01-18-08">01:18:08</a>]  It's like, and then eventually you lose interest.

[<a id="01-18-11">01:18:11</a>]  That's the best you can do.

[<a id="01-18-13">01:18:13</a>]  And so, I've almost forgot the point about this.

[<a id="01-18-17">01:18:17</a>]  Oh yeah, so all this stuff where the more you think

[<a id="01-18-23">01:18:23</a>]  about something, the more it becomes a thing.

[<a id="01-18-26">01:18:26</a>]  So if somebody, if I'm like 40 and I'm just like,

[<a id="01-18-31">01:18:31</a>]  ah, I had a happy childhood and I'm not thinking

[<a id="01-18-34">01:18:34</a>]  about it at all, great, fine.

[<a id="01-18-37">01:18:37</a>]  And then somebody comes along and says, yeah,

[<a id="01-18-40">01:18:40</a>]  but you must have had this experience in your childhood.

[<a id="01-18-42">01:18:42</a>]  You start thinking about it.

[<a id="01-18-43">01:18:43</a>]  Oh yeah, this thing happened.

[<a id="01-18-45">01:18:45</a>]  - I think social media is probably making things worse

[<a id="01-18-47">01:18:47</a>]  for everyone, for a lot of people, I think.

[<a id="01-18-49">01:18:49</a>]  - Yeah, and the thing is, I've worked in software in my life.

[<a id="01-18-54">01:18:54</a>]  To me, you know the idea of a mantra like this--

[<a id="01-18-59">01:18:59</a>]  - Repeating something over and over?

[<a id="01-19-02">01:19:02</a>]  - Yeah, like in Asian or Eastern mysticism,

[<a id="01-19-06">01:19:06</a>]  you've got like the om or the thing,

[<a id="01-19-08">01:19:08</a>]  or Hare Krishna, whatever the stuff they're saying.

[<a id="01-19-12">01:19:12</a>]  To me, the realization is like in my early 40s,

[<a id="01-19-17">01:19:17</a>]  I stopped hearing my mom's voice.

[<a id="01-19-19">01:19:19</a>]  And my mom's voice, it wasn't terribly judging,

[<a id="01-19-24">01:19:24</a>]  but there was some judgment and there were some things

[<a id="01-19-28">01:19:28</a>]  that I realized is like this piece of software,

[<a id="01-19-33">01:19:33</a>]  or it's like a chat GPT of my mom telling me

[<a id="01-19-37">01:19:37</a>]  how I should live my life.

[<a id="01-19-38">01:19:38</a>]  And at a certain point, that software stopped,

[<a id="01-19-41">01:19:41</a>]  it expires, it reaches its sell-by date.

[<a id="01-19-44">01:19:44</a>]  - It's really weird saying that, it's not the same thing,

[<a id="01-19-48">01:19:48</a>]  but I don't even remember what my dad's voice sounds now.

[<a id="01-19-52">01:19:52</a>]  I could still see his face in my head,

[<a id="01-19-55">01:19:55</a>]  but it really faded away.

[<a id="01-19-58">01:19:58</a>]  - But I think that's fundamentally a good thing,

[<a id="01-20-01">01:20:01</a>]  but then if you go and see a therapist

[<a id="01-20-03">01:20:03</a>]  and you talk about your dad for three hours a week,

[<a id="01-20-06">01:20:06</a>]  then it keeps it alive.

[<a id="01-20-09">01:20:09</a>]  It's supposed to fade away, I think.

[<a id="01-20-12">01:20:12</a>]  - Yeah, I guess talking about problem all the time

[<a id="01-20-14">01:20:14</a>]  probably doesn't help.

[<a id="01-20-15">01:20:15</a>]  I guess I don't know what's the healthy level,

[<a id="01-20-19">01:20:19</a>]  'cause I don't think holding onto all your problem,

[<a id="01-20-22">01:20:22</a>]  not talking about it, thinking about it,

[<a id="01-20-23">01:20:23</a>]  it's not healthy either, but overthinking,

[<a id="01-20-28">01:20:28</a>]  Socrates say unexamined life is not worth living,

[<a id="01-20-32">01:20:32</a>]  but over-examined life is not worth living either.

[<a id="01-20-34">01:20:34</a>]  I don't know what's the happy medium.

[<a id="01-20-36">01:20:36</a>]  I think that's the difficult thing to figure out.

[<a id="01-20-38">01:20:38</a>]  - Nobody's said that before.

[<a id="01-20-41">01:20:41</a>]  You need to, the over-examined life is not worth living.

[<a id="01-20-44">01:20:44</a>]  - Well, I mean, it's kind of like--

[<a id="01-20-46">01:20:46</a>]  - This is your philosophy here.

[<a id="01-20-49">01:20:49</a>]  You need to be Socrates 2-0.

[<a id="01-20-53">01:20:53</a>]  That's a great quote.

[<a id="01-20-54">01:20:54</a>]  - No, no, what I'm saying is like,

[<a id="01-20-56">01:20:56</a>]  if you're going from LA to New York City,

[<a id="01-20-58">01:20:58</a>]  there's many different ways of doing it.

[<a id="01-20-59">01:20:59</a>]  The easiest one's flying from LA to New York.

[<a id="01-21-02">01:21:02</a>]  You could drive, you could hitchhike,

[<a id="01-21-04">01:21:04</a>]  you could take a bus, you could take a boat long way around,

[<a id="01-21-07">01:21:07</a>]  or you get paralyzed by planning for all the potential problems

[<a id="01-21-12">01:21:12</a>]  on the way driving, so you're trying to prevent that,

[<a id="01-21-15">01:21:15</a>]  so you're over-preparing, but eventually you have to leave.

[<a id="01-21-18">01:21:18</a>]  But that's the problem.

[<a id="01-21-19">01:21:19</a>]  Some people leave without preparation,

[<a id="01-21-22">01:21:22</a>]  and other people over-prepare,

[<a id="01-21-24">01:21:24</a>]  but eventually life has to go, right?

[<a id="01-21-26">01:21:26</a>]  - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="01-21-27">01:21:27</a>]  - You have to go.

[<a id="01-21-28">01:21:28</a>]  So you can't anticipate all the problems.

[<a id="01-21-30">01:21:30</a>]  - And the thing is, I mean, I say this about therapy

[<a id="01-21-35">01:21:35</a>]  because I've always had this reactionary thing.

[<a id="01-21-39">01:21:39</a>]  I think it's my family with Quakers.

[<a id="01-21-41">01:21:41</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-21-42">01:21:42</a>]  - So when I hear everybody, oh, you need to do therapy,

[<a id="01-21-47">01:21:47</a>]  I'm like, fuck therapy.

[<a id="01-21-49">01:21:49</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-21-50">01:21:50</a>]  - It's like, don't tell me what I need to do, first of all,

[<a id="01-21-53">01:21:53</a>]  but the other thing is more--

[<a id="01-21-54">01:21:54</a>]  - But therapy could be different things, right?

[<a id="01-21-57">01:21:57</a>]  Like, some people talk to therapists,

[<a id="01-22-00">01:22:00</a>]  but other people like to exercise and running,

[<a id="01-22-03">01:22:03</a>]  or they could get coffee, read a book,

[<a id="01-22-05">01:22:05</a>]  or something like that too, you know?

[<a id="01-22-06">01:22:06</a>]  - Yeah, Swiss is all about the running.

[<a id="01-22-09">01:22:09</a>]  They run and they hike.

[<a id="01-22-10">01:22:10</a>]  For me, therapy is chat GPT.

[<a id="01-22-13">01:22:13</a>]  - Huh.

[<a id="01-22-14">01:22:14</a>]  - And there's a thing I did two days ago.

[<a id="01-22-21">01:22:21</a>]  You know, have you heard this notion of prompts?

[<a id="01-22-25">01:22:25</a>]  So with chat--

[<a id="01-22-25">01:22:25</a>]  - I don't know what that is.

[<a id="01-22-26">01:22:26</a>]  - A prompt is--

[<a id="01-22-27">01:22:27</a>]  - I don't do any other AIs.

[<a id="01-22-29">01:22:29</a>]  I know, I have a face that look like saying,

[<a id="01-22-31">01:22:31</a>]  I do AI and high tech.

[<a id="01-22-32">01:22:32</a>]  I do none of that stuff.

[<a id="01-22-33">01:22:33</a>]  - So AI, my expertise is transgender porn.

[<a id="01-22-38">01:22:38</a>]  So, you know, this is what we're talking about here.

[<a id="01-22-40">01:22:40</a>]  - You, well, a lot of, first of all,

[<a id="01-22-44">01:22:44</a>]  I asked chat GPT about you.

[<a id="01-22-47">01:22:47</a>]  It knows about you because--

[<a id="01-22-48">01:22:48</a>]  - It doesn't know me.

[<a id="01-22-50">01:22:50</a>]  They just know a lot of facts about me.

[<a id="01-22-51">01:22:51</a>]  - Yeah, but--

[<a id="01-22-53">01:22:53</a>]  - It doesn't know me.

[<a id="01-22-54">01:22:54</a>]  - You think.

[<a id="01-22-55">01:22:55</a>]  - Well.

[<a id="01-22-56">01:22:56</a>]  - So here's what I did.

[<a id="01-22-59">01:22:59</a>]  There's a thing called the God prompt.

[<a id="01-23-03">01:23:03</a>]  So chat GPT, by default, gives you like a basic,

[<a id="01-23-08">01:23:08</a>]  it's like a basic bitch, basically.

[<a id="01-23-10">01:23:10</a>]  But then if you tell it how it should behave

[<a id="01-23-13">01:23:13</a>]  and what things it should do, you can get very,

[<a id="01-23-15">01:23:15</a>]  and these are called prompts.

[<a id="01-23-18">01:23:18</a>]  So you say, I want you to act as like Socrates

[<a id="01-23-23">01:23:23</a>]  and explain like Greek and imagine it's like Greece

[<a id="01-23-27">01:23:27</a>]  over 3000 years ago.

[<a id="01-23-29">01:23:29</a>]  Explain why you said an unexamined life

[<a id="01-23-32">01:23:32</a>]  is not worth living.

[<a id="01-23-33">01:23:33</a>]  And then it will manage to switch its context

[<a id="01-23-38">01:23:38</a>]  to tell you that based on the data it's been given.

[<a id="01-23-40">01:23:40</a>]  Now, I asked, there's a thing called the God prompt,

[<a id="01-23-44">01:23:44</a>]  which is basically a psycho.

[<a id="01-23-46">01:23:46</a>]  And it's called the God prompt.

[<a id="01-23-49">01:23:49</a>]  This is made up on TikTok.

[<a id="01-23-51">01:23:51</a>]  But it's a couple of questions you ask chat GPT

[<a id="01-23-54">01:23:54</a>]  based on all the interactions you've had

[<a id="01-23-57">01:23:57</a>]  where it tells you what your problem is.

[<a id="01-24-00">01:24:00</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="01-24-01">01:24:01</a>]  - And it says like, you have a fear of this

[<a id="01-24-06">01:24:06</a>]  and you have this and then you're doing this all the time.

[<a id="01-24-09">01:24:09</a>]  These things you do well, those things.

[<a id="01-24-11">01:24:11</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-24-12">01:24:12</a>]  - And I did this and the answers,

[<a id="01-24-15">01:24:15</a>]  I haven't told everything.

[<a id="01-24-17">01:24:17</a>]  - Did it show you a picture of a gun?

[<a id="01-24-19">01:24:19</a>]  - No, no.

[<a id="01-24-20">01:24:20</a>]  It said one of the things that I have a fear of irrelevant.

[<a id="01-24-27">01:24:27</a>]  So that and that certainly resonates

[<a id="01-24-32">01:24:32</a>]  because I was like building up to doing something

[<a id="01-24-35">01:24:35</a>]  and then I ended up with kids

[<a id="01-24-39">01:24:39</a>]  and I was very frustrated for 10 years

[<a id="01-24-41">01:24:41</a>]  because I was like, I'm figuring out some path.

[<a id="01-24-45">01:24:45</a>]  Probably I was not going anywhere.

[<a id="01-24-47">01:24:47</a>]  - Were you married at 10 years?

[<a id="01-24-49">01:24:49</a>]  - I was never married.

[<a id="01-24-52">01:24:52</a>]  - Oh, okay.

[<a id="01-24-53">01:24:53</a>]  - But we were together like a married couple.

[<a id="01-24-55">01:24:55</a>]  But I was very frustrated for the beginning

[<a id="01-25-00">01:25:00</a>]  because I was like, I've got this talent,

[<a id="01-25-04">01:25:04</a>]  I've got ability and I want to make something

[<a id="01-25-06">01:25:06</a>]  and now I've got to look after kids.

[<a id="01-25-10">01:25:10</a>]  So China GPT got this.

[<a id="01-25-12">01:25:12</a>]  Mostly I've been using it to help me write

[<a id="01-25-17">01:25:17</a>]  the text description for a comedy show promoting

[<a id="01-25-21">01:25:21</a>]  or I use it to work a lot.

[<a id="01-25-22">01:25:22</a>]  But based on my language patterns,

[<a id="01-25-27">01:25:27</a>]  based on the type of questions I'm asking it,

[<a id="01-25-30">01:25:30</a>]  it's able to come up with a pretty,

[<a id="01-25-32">01:25:32</a>]  like there's like a hundred hours of therapy

[<a id="01-25-36">01:25:36</a>]  I just saved by doing this.

[<a id="01-25-38">01:25:38</a>]  - Interesting.

[<a id="01-25-39">01:25:39</a>]  And probably if we ask chat GPT the right questions

[<a id="01-25-43">01:25:43</a>]  about you, 'cause they've definitely fed it

[<a id="01-25-44">01:25:44</a>]  all the podcasts they could find.

[<a id="01-25-46">01:25:46</a>]  - You know, I think his name is William Goldman.

[<a id="01-25-49">01:25:49</a>]  I like to talk to him a lot.

[<a id="01-25-51">01:25:51</a>]  He won one or two Oscars.

[<a id="01-25-52">01:25:52</a>]  He famously wrote Princess Bride.

[<a id="01-25-56">01:25:56</a>]  He wrote that script.

[<a id="01-25-57">01:25:57</a>]  I think he had two Oscars.

[<a id="01-25-59">01:25:59</a>]  Oh my God, I apologize to listen, I feel stupid.

[<a id="01-26-05">01:26:05</a>]  He won one for political thriller,

[<a id="01-26-10">01:26:10</a>]  maybe something related to Watergate.

[<a id="01-26-14">01:26:14</a>]  I'm blanking, I haven't slept that much.

[<a id="01-26-16">01:26:16</a>]  But anyway, he won two Oscars.

[<a id="01-26-17">01:26:17</a>]  He won one or two of them.

[<a id="01-26-19">01:26:19</a>]  But he famously say no one knows anything.

[<a id="01-26-21">01:26:21</a>]  In other words, when he was at the peak of his career,

[<a id="01-26-27">01:26:27</a>]  they're making between three to maybe 500 movies

[<a id="01-26-29">01:26:29</a>]  in Hollywood and a lot of them don't do well.

[<a id="01-26-31">01:26:31</a>]  Well, obviously they made thinking

[<a id="01-26-33">01:26:33</a>]  that they were gonna be good.

[<a id="01-26-35">01:26:35</a>]  It's a lot of time when you do something,

[<a id="01-26-36">01:26:36</a>]  even successful one, they didn't realize

[<a id="01-26-39">01:26:39</a>]  it's gonna be that successful

[<a id="01-26-41">01:26:41</a>]  because you're just not sure about anything that,

[<a id="01-26-44">01:26:44</a>]  you know, people just pretend like they know

[<a id="01-26-46">01:26:46</a>]  what they're doing, you know?

[<a id="01-26-47">01:26:47</a>]  So I have friends who are paralyzed by therapy.

[<a id="01-26-53">01:26:53</a>]  They do a lot.

[<a id="01-26-53">01:26:53</a>]  I've never done it.

[<a id="01-26-54">01:26:54</a>]  And I just know that my personality

[<a id="01-26-57">01:26:57</a>]  and plus growing up in Japan, unlike South Korea,

[<a id="01-27-02">01:27:02</a>]  I know a lot of my Korean friends do therapy

[<a id="01-27-04">01:27:04</a>]  and things like that.

[<a id="01-27-05">01:27:05</a>]  But Segun Foy, Carl Yoon and people like that

[<a id="01-27-09">01:27:09</a>]  never penetrated Japanese mind, you know?

[<a id="01-27-12">01:27:12</a>]  It's not a big place to do that

[<a id="01-27-14">01:27:14</a>]  because reveal yourself and talk about yourself.

[<a id="01-27-17">01:27:17</a>]  They're not gonna do that.

[<a id="01-27-18">01:27:18</a>]  You know, that whole notion is very, very strange.

[<a id="01-27-21">01:27:21</a>]  - Okay, I've got it.

[<a id="01-27-22">01:27:22</a>]  We're gonna, would you be down to do this

[<a id="01-27-25">01:27:25</a>]  as a little experiment?

[<a id="01-27-26">01:27:26</a>]  - Well, first of all, has it actually been recording?

[<a id="01-27-32">01:27:32</a>]  - Yeah, we've got an hour and a half already.

[<a id="01-27-37">01:27:37</a>]  - Oh, wow.

[<a id="01-27-37">01:27:37</a>]  So it would have been funny if that's this whole time

[<a id="01-27-41">01:27:41</a>]  we were talking, we didn't record it.

[<a id="01-27-42">01:27:42</a>]  - Well, we got two audio.

[<a id="01-27-44">01:27:44</a>]  We got that, that's the second audio track.

[<a id="01-27-46">01:27:46</a>]  But with semi-pro here with kind of shitty podcasters.

[<a id="01-27-51">01:27:51</a>]  No, the, all right, this could be an interesting thing

[<a id="01-27-54">01:27:54</a>]  for us to do in a later podcast.

[<a id="01-27-56">01:27:56</a>]  - Well, maybe interesting for you.

[<a id="01-27-57">01:27:57</a>]  - If you, but I'd be also interested to see,

[<a id="01-28-03">01:28:03</a>]  I mean, you could look at the results first without me.

[<a id="01-28-07">01:28:07</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-28-07">01:28:07</a>]  - Like, and if you wanna talk about it

[<a id="01-28-10">01:28:10</a>]  or if you wanna share that,

[<a id="01-28-11">01:28:11</a>]  because I think you might be surprised.

[<a id="01-28-14">01:28:14</a>]  Like, if we took the transcript

[<a id="01-28-16">01:28:16</a>]  of what we've been talking about.

[<a id="01-28-18">01:28:18</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="01-28-18">01:28:18</a>]  - What, what--

[<a id="01-28-21">01:28:21</a>]  - I am curious now, so you take the transcript

[<a id="01-28-24">01:28:24</a>]  and then you ask, like, what's the problem with Yoshi?

[<a id="01-28-26">01:28:26</a>]  He'll give you a--

[<a id="01-28-28">01:28:28</a>]  - Well, just the way people construct language.

[<a id="01-28-31">01:28:31</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-28-32">01:28:32</a>]  - So if you look at the pauses,

[<a id="01-28-34">01:28:34</a>]  I mean, we know this as comedians,

[<a id="01-28-35">01:28:35</a>]  we play with language a lot.

[<a id="01-28-37">01:28:37</a>]  But you can follow someone's train of thought.

[<a id="01-28-40">01:28:40</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="01-28-40">01:28:40</a>]  - And, you know, you see different comedians.

[<a id="01-28-43">01:28:43</a>]  There's, like, the ADHD comedian

[<a id="01-28-45">01:28:45</a>]  who at the moment there's a distraction.

[<a id="01-28-47">01:28:47</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-28-47">01:28:47</a>]  - He has a funny reaction, it's hilarious.

[<a id="01-28-49">01:28:49</a>]  And it's, like--

[<a id="01-28-51">01:28:51</a>]  - I'm curious about that too.

[<a id="01-28-52">01:28:52</a>]  - It's also things like, like--

[<a id="01-28-58">01:28:58</a>]  - You know who was talking about that is Steve Martin.

[<a id="01-29-00">01:29:00</a>]  He has philosophy degree,

[<a id="01-29-03">01:29:03</a>]  almost graduated from philosophy degree

[<a id="01-29-04">01:29:04</a>]  from Long Beach State.

[<a id="01-29-05">01:29:05</a>]  His favorite philosopher was,

[<a id="01-29-08">01:29:08</a>]  maybe I'm not saying his name right,

[<a id="01-29-09">01:29:09</a>]  but Ludwig Wittgenstein.

[<a id="01-29-11">01:29:11</a>]  - Oh, he's the crazy philosopher, yeah.

[<a id="01-29-14">01:29:14</a>]  - Yeah, 'cause one time he asked Bertrand Russell,

[<a id="01-29-16">01:29:16</a>]  another famous British, a famous British philosopher.

[<a id="01-29-19">01:29:19</a>]  He said, he asked Russell, like,

[<a id="01-29-22">01:29:22</a>]  "Should I become a philosopher?"

[<a id="01-29-23">01:29:23</a>]  And then he asked Ludwig to write him something.

[<a id="01-29-27">01:29:27</a>]  And I think he wrote, like, a first sentence or something.

[<a id="01-29-29">01:29:29</a>]  "Yeah, you need to be a philosopher."

[<a id="01-29-30">01:29:30</a>]  And there was a story about Ludwig

[<a id="01-29-33">01:29:33</a>]  supposed to climb up a tree

[<a id="01-29-34">01:29:34</a>]  and stay on top of that tree for a while or something.

[<a id="01-29-36">01:29:36</a>]  But he's famous for, like, that thing,

[<a id="01-29-38">01:29:38</a>]  like, language game, right?

[<a id="01-29-39">01:29:39</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-29-40">01:29:40</a>]  - And it's very mathematical.

[<a id="01-29-41">01:29:41</a>]  I tried to read it, I have no idea what he's saying.

[<a id="01-29-43">01:29:43</a>]  But he's just so beyond me, you know?

[<a id="01-29-46">01:29:46</a>]  - So here's another theory I got,

[<a id="01-29-50">01:29:50</a>]  is that different people have different ways of thinking.

[<a id="01-29-54">01:29:54</a>]  So I think mostly when you have, like, abstract,

[<a id="01-29-58">01:29:58</a>]  the way you can understand the way someone's brains work

[<a id="01-30-02">01:30:02</a>]  is you ask them an abstract question

[<a id="01-30-04">01:30:04</a>]  where they have to think about it.

[<a id="01-30-05">01:30:05</a>]  - Oh, it doesn't work.

[<a id="01-30-06">01:30:06</a>]  - And for me, I'm a visual thinker.

[<a id="01-30-09">01:30:09</a>]  So you ask me an abstract question,

[<a id="01-30-11">01:30:11</a>]  what I'm gonna do is my eyes will probably go to the left.

[<a id="01-30-15">01:30:15</a>]  I make some kind of picture in my head.

[<a id="01-30-18">01:30:18</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="01-30-19">01:30:19</a>]  - And then I come back and interpret that picture

[<a id="01-30-22">01:30:22</a>]  with logic and words and whatever.

[<a id="01-30-23">01:30:23</a>]  I remember listening to Kanye on the Joe Rogan podcast.

[<a id="01-30-29">01:30:29</a>]  - What a fascinating guy.

[<a id="01-30-31">01:30:31</a>]  - Yeah, and he sounds like a madman

[<a id="01-30-34">01:30:34</a>]  until in that podcast, about two hours in,

[<a id="01-30-38">01:30:38</a>]  the whole thing that he'd been talking about

[<a id="01-30-41">01:30:41</a>]  suddenly started to make sense.

[<a id="01-30-43">01:30:43</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="01-30-43">01:30:43</a>]  - And he's like a three or four dimensional thinker.

[<a id="01-30-48">01:30:48</a>]  He's got some hypercube that he's putting all this stuff

[<a id="01-30-52">01:30:52</a>]  and to try and explain it in an A equals B equals C manner,

[<a id="01-30-58">01:30:58</a>]  which is linear, makes no sense to people.

[<a id="01-31-01">01:31:01</a>]  - If somebody asked me like the five to seven,

[<a id="01-31-04">01:31:04</a>]  I don't know, influential word is right, impactful person.

[<a id="01-31-09">01:31:09</a>]  But let's say I have to pick like five,

[<a id="01-31-11">01:31:11</a>]  maybe 10 influential people last 10 years.

[<a id="01-31-14">01:31:14</a>]  I could have met them but I never met them.

[<a id="01-31-18">01:31:18</a>]  If I have to make a 10 people or less easily,

[<a id="01-31-21">01:31:21</a>]  him, Trump, Elon Musk is there

[<a id="01-31-25">01:31:25</a>]  'cause they're doing, I'm not saying what they're doing is right.

[<a id="01-31-28">01:31:28</a>]  It's just that they think different

[<a id="01-31-29">01:31:29</a>]  and they behave differently and they're very, very interesting.

[<a id="01-31-32">01:31:32</a>]  - Weirdly, Lausanne lady, she hated Elon Musk.

[<a id="01-31-40">01:31:40</a>]  - Is this a lady that you knew?

[<a id="01-31-42">01:31:42</a>]  - It's the one that I was talking about

[<a id="01-31-47">01:31:47</a>]  before I met you.

[<a id="01-31-48">01:31:48</a>]  I think one thing--

[<a id="01-31-50">01:31:50</a>]  - That's the area in Switzerland, right?

[<a id="01-31-52">01:31:52</a>]  - I've got to, I mean, I will just edit this.

[<a id="01-31-55">01:31:55</a>]  I think she got sex trafficked by her dad

[<a id="01-31-59">01:31:59</a>]  who was high up at Swiss bank

[<a id="01-32-02">01:32:02</a>]  and he used to take her on business trips.

[<a id="01-32-03">01:32:03</a>]  There's a possibility she even,

[<a id="01-32-07">01:32:07</a>]  like I see a possibility where she may have got abused

[<a id="01-32-12">01:32:12</a>]  by Elon Musk as a kid.

[<a id="01-32-15">01:32:15</a>]  And so she had an ability to read people that was uncanny

[<a id="01-32-20">01:32:20</a>]  and she did not like, she had like this reaction

[<a id="01-32-24">01:32:24</a>]  to Elon Musk of like, he's an evil motherfucker.

[<a id="01-32-28">01:32:28</a>]  And Elon Musk is definitely,

[<a id="01-32-31">01:32:31</a>]  has got multiple personalities.

[<a id="01-32-33">01:32:33</a>]  And to me, the most revealing thing with Elon Musk

[<a id="01-32-37">01:32:37</a>]  was seeing his mom on SNL.

[<a id="01-32-40">01:32:40</a>]  And if you don't get a creepy vibe off his mom,

[<a id="01-32-44">01:32:44</a>]  there's like then you're in a weird,

[<a id="01-32-47">01:32:47</a>]  you're like, did you remember that?

[<a id="01-32-49">01:32:49</a>]  Did you see that?

[<a id="01-32-49">01:32:49</a>]  - Yeah, can you keep talking, keep talking?

[<a id="01-32-52">01:32:52</a>]  - Let's take a break, I've got to piss.

[<a id="01-32-53">01:32:53</a>]  - I've got to piss too.

[<a id="01-32-54">01:32:54</a>]  - Yeah, okay, you go first.

[<a id="01-32-55">01:32:55</a>]  I'll stop and we can resume.

[<a id="01-32-58">01:32:58</a>]  And I'll give you a coffee two more times then.

[<a id="01-33-02">01:33:02</a>]  How long have you been doing this?

[<a id="01-33-03">01:33:03</a>]  Does it work?
