[00:00:00] Yeah, it's so cool. You wanted a podium. This is, it's close to it. You're going to make

[00:00:13] a presidential address, but I mean, yeah, these pick up. Wow. Even a bit, even here,

[00:00:29] you can, I guess we should be about, have a listen yourself. It's really sensitive,

[00:00:36] which is cool. Maybe we can, wait, I could hear you talk to you. Yeah. Like from, I'm here like

[00:00:44] three, four inches away. Yeah. And maybe we put them, we'll put them like this and then it's less,

[00:00:51] does that sound okay? Yeah. Yeah. I don't mind using headphones because I could hear you better.

[00:00:58] Okay. Cool. Yeah. All right. That's cool. Yeah. You tell me if I'm getting too far from the mic.

[00:01:04] All right. So are you already recording? No, no. I mean, I guess. On that one, yeah. And this. It's

[00:01:18] not like we don't do anything formal. Yeah, that's cool. All right. We're rolling. What is it? Today is, so it's

[00:01:29] November 22nd. Friday, November 22nd. Zurich, Switzerland. I've been in, I guess I've been in

[00:01:39] Switzerland by 12 hours. And we just had a nice coffee break with a lady named Hara. Yeah. Hara.

[00:01:49] I was surprised because I just had this notion that most Swiss are not that personable, well not

[00:01:58] personable, but approachable, you know. And she was very, very nice. And then when we find that

[00:02:04] she's great, it made sense, you know. She was very sunny disposition and things like that. Yeah, I mean.

[00:02:11] Well, I think you made the, like, because you were naturally like welcoming, come and join us. And. Am I?

[00:02:21] Yeah, yeah. For this place, definitely. And. So it's a very low standards here. People don't do

[00:02:29] that because this is, it's a timing thing. I think you were very quick because I have what I call

[00:02:35] shitty fame. So I'm not famous, but in the city and I could, because it's small enough people

[00:02:43] who see me doing comedy. So she was like, oh, I know you. I can't even remember. It's interesting

[00:02:49] because I think it's probably true in South Korea too. People don't talk to strangers, you know. And

[00:02:53] I think for some extent, it's probably true in Japan too. But I have a hard time explaining myself.

[00:03:01] Like you were telling me, look, nobody's going to come to see me do shows, which I understand

[00:03:06] because that's in the States too. But I'm having a hard time explaining what do I do or who I am,

[00:03:14] you know, because I think I got such a really weird background as well, you know. I mean, I think, I

[00:03:25] mean, this is something I say about comedy. It's like when I was when I got into it during the

[00:03:32] lockdown, I don't know if you know Judy Carter. Of course, she wrote that stupid book, not stupid

[00:03:38] book, but she's famous for writing and helped to do stand up comedy like 30 plus years ago. Yeah,

[00:03:44] the new comedy Bible. And I did it. I actually took her class years ago. We have somebody in

[00:03:51] common. I took her class too. It was actually, she delegated all the work to another comedian

[00:03:56] called Dean who was, he was phenomenal. But there was one of the things is about like your comedy

[00:04:04] career and how you've got to focus if you want to get famous, which which when you're for me at 50,

[00:04:12] that feels ridiculous. Like and if from what I know about your background, but also if I look

[00:04:18] at my own life, I feel like I've lived seven lives already. And in terms of like the role,

[00:04:25] it's so strange to say you want to be famous, but especially young kids, they want to be famous.

[00:04:29] Yeah, I have such a mixed feeling about that, you know? I mean, because every time I hear that,

[00:04:38] just think mental illness. That's what I think. You know? Yeah. And I mean, for me, that's like

[00:04:46] fame is maybe a means to an end. I just enjoyed doing comedy shows. Yeah. And unfortunately,

[00:04:53] you have to do the whole promotion thing to get people to come to shows. But every time I think

[00:04:58] about stand up comedy, I mean, of course, it's, you know, I just saw bill burr last Sunday. So

[00:05:03] it's what today's Friday. Yeah, like six days ago. And I haven't. I'm at it, you know, I don't want

[00:05:10] to bother the guy, but I saw him after the show talking like a minute to you. Always generous,

[00:05:15] great guy. It was really nice to see him to see a guy at that level. And also, you know,

[00:05:22] for anybody who followed comedy last four or five years, there's been comedians that we like,

[00:05:28] we find out that they're far from perfect people. They're doing stuff off stage that's questionable.

[00:05:34] I don't want to name their names. Yeah. But burr is one of those few people that I have to say,

[00:05:40] I've never heard anything bad about the guy ever, how generous he is with other people. And even

[00:05:51] with the angry thing, when he's on stage, it's pretty justifiable. He's just genuinely upset

[00:05:57] about something, you know? Yeah. But now, it's kind of funny to see him because he's so successful,

[00:06:02] famous, people love him. It's hard to be angry when you're being beloved and have successful. So

[00:06:09] what was so great because I've never seen him do this before. It was the first time his wife was

[00:06:14] there. And she was off stage. And he's talking back and forth to her and he's trying to convince

[00:06:20] her to get on stage, which she refused wisely. But that was a really funny banter. But it's really

[00:06:26] nice to see him, somebody at that level, work really hard for many decades, reaching it, you

[00:06:31] know? But at our level, it just feels like we're just getting hammered, just hitting ourselves in

[00:06:37] the face when we're doing it because you have to be pretty fucking insane to do stand-up comedy.

[00:06:43] Yeah. I mean, if you're getting something out of it, and I know some of my colleagues

[00:06:49] last couple of years got in trouble because they have success and they're going after women and

[00:06:53] we're not at exactly most mature groups of people, you know? Yeah. I mean, about Bill Byrd,

[00:07:03] one thing is, one of my weird things is whenever I wake up at three in the morning and can't sleep,

[00:07:08] I listen to Bill Byrd's podcast. Oh, do you really? Yeah. He sends me to sleep,

[00:07:15] but I've listened to it. That sounds like insult. It is kind of, but it's because what's great is

[00:07:20] he's got, his voice is usually consistent. He does it on his own. Yeah. You turn the volume down to

[00:07:26] just the right level and it just sends, so I've got all his anger in my subconscious, but also

[00:07:32] he's actually, if I look at his perspective of the world, some of the things he talks about,

[00:07:38] like he's always going on about how he hates bankers because they own everything and how

[00:07:44] the system's rigged when you look into it. I'm glad you said that because

[00:07:49] when Teresa O'Neil passed away in 2011, Bill was one of his closest friends and Bill told me like

[00:08:01] last Sunday, so they got in a big fight, they never got reconciled. Kind of sad, but you know,

[00:08:08] when Steve Jobs passed away, Apple turned around and replaced him by having different experts.

[00:08:14] They had an expert from architect, they had an expert from music like Dr. Dre or something,

[00:08:18] so they brought all this expert to kind of bring back. How do you replace someone like Steve Jobs

[00:08:24] at Apple? This is very, very difficult and when Patrice died, there was two comedians that kind

[00:08:32] of started coming around that time, Shane Gillis and Tim Dillon. I've seen those. I've never talked

[00:08:38] to them. I like both of them. Tim Dillon's got the thing that Burr has. I know they're funny and

[00:08:46] ridiculous at times, but they're both righteous people. Their anger comes from because they really

[00:08:51] pay attention to what's going on. I really particularly like when Tim did that and he's

[00:08:57] over the board crazy and kind of sarcastic and silly, but that one episode he did on Ukraine,

[00:09:03] he was dead on right about that. It's not about democracy or saving the world. There was something

[00:09:09] bigger than that and I think he's so knowledgeable about what Americans and our government have done

[00:09:15] overseas and what power does to people and corruption and things like that. Oddly enough,

[00:09:20] we were here in Switzerland where one of the guys he talks about is Alan Dulles who was the head of

[00:09:26] OSS and later on CIA. He was one of those dirty motherfuckers. He really was and he was doing dirty

[00:09:34] business here and he was protecting Nazis, literally Nazis here. I like Tim. I like Burr

[00:09:41] because I think they're not going to say it, but to me they're pretty righteous people to me.

[00:09:48] Have you ever seen Tim Dillon did this episode where he reviewed the opening video for the

[00:09:56] Gotthard Tunnel, which is a tunnel in Switzerland. No, I missed that one. This is a big engineering

[00:10:01] achievement for Switzerland. They built this tunnel through the mountains from the north part

[00:10:06] of Switzerland to the Italian part in the south. When they opened it, they had this bizarre ceremony

[00:10:13] which looks like a satanic ritual. They had dudes dressed up as goats. What are we talking

[00:10:22] about? 10 years ago, 15 years ago? This is about 10 years ago, but Tim Dillon reviewed it like

[00:10:28] two years ago, someone said. His take on it is hilarious. He's just stunned by how they're not

[00:10:40] even hiding. This is like if you believe in world economic forum conspiracy theories, they're running

[00:10:46] the world. They have this evil satanic agenda. This ceremony is just wide open. This reminds me

[00:10:56] Denver International Airport because it's shaped like swastika. Which airport? Denver in Colorado.

[00:11:01] Oh, okay. It's shaped like swastika. What's funny is they're self-aware airport because they have

[00:11:08] a science. They will show a picture of a reptile saying, "Is this airport run by reptilian

[00:11:13] conspiracy people?" They have all this funny stuff around the airport piling up. I've got to

[00:11:20] say a swastika is probably a pretty good design for an airport. You can get the maximum number

[00:11:27] of planes lined up there. It makes sense somehow. Well, I'm sure it's really awkward for Israeli

[00:11:35] airlines to land in Denver. It's weird with this conspiracy and secrets because these days

[00:11:43] what's funny is it's better to tell people the truth and nobody cares.

[00:11:47] During COVID, they were showing pictures of UFOs. If they showed that in the 80s,

[00:11:53] I think there would have been massive hysteria and panic. Nobody cares. The public response is like,

[00:11:59] "Okay, what's next?" Nobody cares. You could give all the information and say

[00:12:03] they're doing all kinds of terrible things, but most people are just so indifferent these days.

[00:12:08] I think it's too much. A little overwhelmed, right? I mean, yesterday I was doing this comedy

[00:12:16] show and I was doing a joke about how we're this close to World War III right now. Then there was

[00:12:21] this woman in the second one and I was like, "What?" I'm like, "How do you not know that Russia

[00:12:28] and NATO are this close to things kicking off?" You're like, "I haven't even heard of this."

[00:12:38] -Personally, I think a lot of this stuff is just exaggerated. This is like a performance art.

[00:12:43] -Maybe. Yeah, maybe. But I mean, I'm addicted to listening to stuff about how the world runs

[00:12:55] and this kind of stuff. -Sure. Or how it doesn't run.

[00:12:57] -Then once you've got into that stuff, it's almost like you're living in a separate reality

[00:13:06] to other people. -Yeah. I mean, how many disaster

[00:13:09] movies do we have to watch in Hollywood? The guy says, "In the world." I just wish it does end.

[00:13:16] I'm sick of this. I've heard this kind of shit all my life and the danger of this and that,

[00:13:24] but at the end of the day, I think a lot of it is really grossly exaggerated.

[00:13:31] -I'm not worried about anything. -Of course, with most things, I have a half-smart idea. There's a

[00:13:37] bit that never worked. I was trying to say this to an audience. Back in the Middle Ages, they had

[00:13:44] this terror of dragons. Then the king would rock up and go, "Oh, we must stop the dragons. That's

[00:13:52] why I'm going to need your goats and your first daughter and all your money to help for the

[00:14:00] dragons until somebody finally figured out there's no dragons." A lot of this stuff is, to me, it's

[00:14:07] the same thing. There's always got to be a fear of something, some disaster, so that you're like,

[00:14:18] "Oh, well then take my money because I need you to protect me." -Yeah. I think we may make a small

[00:14:25] example where I see these Asian-American groups representing me and other Asian people. I never

[00:14:31] asked them to do that, but they're self-appointed. -Oh, interesting. -They're all doing all kinds of

[00:14:35] shit that I don't really give a shit about. -What kind of things? -I don't know. If there's an

[00:14:41] incident where an Asian person got hurt or ridiculed in public, that these people are

[00:14:45] going to go and rectify that. I didn't fucking ask you to do that. Most Asian people, like myself,

[00:14:51] who are fobbed fresh off the boat and have accent, they're too busy working. We don't care about

[00:14:56] things that Asian-Americans are into. There's a difference between Asians living in America with

[00:15:01] the U.S. citizenship, but to me, they're Asians. There's Asian-Americans who have faces like mine,

[00:15:07] but they don't know anything about Asian heritage and culture, but they're using this as a pretext

[00:15:12] to represent the whole group. Who are you? Nobody asked you to do any of this stuff. -They're like,

[00:15:17] what, second generation? -Or third or whatever, and they don't know anything about their background.

[00:15:21] That's what I like when they say Asian heritage, this and that. When I talk to them,

[00:15:26] they don't know anything. You can't tell me that something's important. You don't even bother to

[00:15:30] spend time learning that, so you have no business telling me, "Well, we have to do this for Asian

[00:15:35] group." Look. -I've always found it weird how much America's made an identity out of race,

[00:15:45] and I know there's probably, if anyone ever heard that, they want to kill me, but the thing is,

[00:15:52] growing up in England, we took a lot of people, and it's got fucked up history. We took people

[00:15:59] from the colonies that we captured, and then by the '60s, we needed people to work, so we invited

[00:16:06] all kinds of people, and mostly, it worked out pretty well. There were some times where there

[00:16:11] was different, we called it race riots and stuff, but it used to be. England now is a different

[00:16:19] place, at least what I hear, because I don't live there, but back in the day, it was just like your

[00:16:26] color wasn't really an issue, or your racial identity. -I think when you look at media,

[00:16:32] you think there's so much conflict between different groups. On my birthday this year,

[00:16:37] I went to Israel, and based on what you see on television, you would think they're always fighting

[00:16:42] Jews and Muslims are fighting each other, but as soon as I got there, there's Jews and Muslims

[00:16:50] walking around in a subway. It is a little weird. You're taking the subway, you see attractive Jewish

[00:16:58] girl in the IDF uniform with a machine gun, things like that, and across from her is a Muslim girl,

[00:17:03] completely covered in burqa and things like that, and they're not friends, they're just minding

[00:17:09] their own business. They exist peacefully, and I think most people just, it's not as people think

[00:17:18] it is, I think most people just mind their own business, because they have a lot of things to

[00:17:21] worry about. They're taking care of their family, they have to work, and I went to a couple restaurants

[00:17:24] where it's like Jews are in a restaurant owned by Muslims. You just don't bring up those things that

[00:17:31] upset people. Just, hey, you know, order your food, eat, pay, and get the fuck out so the Muslims could

[00:17:37] take your money and pay for their bill for their family. You know, like, I think everybody

[00:17:41] gets along fine, you know. Of course, if you go to Gaza, it's a different story, but I just think

[00:17:47] most people mind their own business, and I think that's the best thing you could do.

[00:17:53] It's too dangerous when people go their other way and try to help other people.

[00:17:58] This is what, like, liberal white people are trying to do. It's, you know, Malcolm X famously said,

[00:18:03] "Just beware of white liberals. They're the most dangerous people out there."

[00:18:07] Conservative people are like wolves. Like, they're up to no good, so you know how to deal with them.

[00:18:13] When you deal with white liberal people, you trust them, and because you open up to them,

[00:18:18] there's a chance that they might betray you. That's the danger of white liberals, you know.

[00:18:23] Just like, I have a similar thing I say with my kids, because for a while, my daughter was going

[00:18:29] about, "Yeah, I want to do something that has an impact." And I'm just like, "You know what the

[00:18:34] worst thing is on this planet? A young person that wants to change the world." Like, if you can tidy

[00:18:40] your own bedroom consistently and run your own life, then you've reached a level where you've

[00:18:46] figured enough shit out that you could actually do something. That's why those young people are

[00:18:50] crazy to me, because they don't even fix their fucking bed in the morning, and they don't have

[00:18:55] a job or whatnot, but they think they could change the world. And here's the thing, they probably can

[00:18:58] change the world for worse, not for better, because are you well-versed in education, experience,

[00:19:08] and live long enough to know what's the problem, what's causing the problem, and you know the

[00:19:12] solution, and you know how to execute the solution? You're a pretty arrogant person to think like that.

[00:19:16] I just think one of the number one or number two rules of Eddie Murphy is saying mind your own damn

[00:19:22] business, and the world will be a better place if you do mind your own business, you know? But I don't

[00:19:27] think they do that, because growing up in America, you know, like most Japanese people watch cowboy

[00:19:34] movies think, cowboy movies are exactly the way cowboys live. You know, they're idealistic, and

[00:19:40] they're protecting the weak, and they protect ladies and things like that. Boy, that's far from

[00:19:45] the truth, you know? And I think... Actually, I don't know if it's true, but I heard that in

[00:19:51] reality most cowboys were black. I don't know if that's true, but the myth of the... I know I've

[00:19:58] never verified this, but in the movies the cowboys are white guys, and it said in reality the guys

[00:20:06] moving the cattle around were usually black. I don't know any of the racial component of cowboys.

[00:20:13] All I know is that my understanding of cowboys back then is they're poorly paid laborers in a

[00:20:18] pretty difficult, miserable lives, you know? Yeah, yeah. So I think we have a tendency to idealize,

[00:20:24] but I'm 55 years old, and I've read some books in my life. I travel a little bit, a little bit.

[00:20:30] And I just think you should respect people. You could disagree with somebody, but you should

[00:20:39] respect people. And two, just because they do something different from you, it doesn't mean

[00:20:44] it's wrong. And even if it's unjust, there's not a whole lot you could do to get yourself involved,

[00:20:52] because all you're going to do is... Most likely you make the situation worse and get yourself

[00:20:56] killed, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's a really difficult thing to do that when you're

[00:21:00] young. You want to do the decent thing, but I think that's... It's dangerous when you think

[00:21:05] you could get yourself involved, you know? Did you ever read the Tao Te Ching or Tao Te Ching,

[00:21:12] the Chinese book of wisdom? No, but there's a guy named James Inman, very friendly comedian,

[00:21:18] won the either Seattle or San Francisco comedy competition, a good friend of Doug Stanhope.

[00:21:22] And he'd get drunk and angry and screaming loud, but he's always talked about this peaceful book

[00:21:27] from Asia, ironically. When I was, I don't know, I don't know why, but when I was like 18,

[00:21:37] I got fascinated with... I read The Arts of War, I read The Book of Five Rings, is that Chinese?

[00:21:44] Miyamoto Musashi, yeah. Yeah, and also Tao Te Ching. He killed a kid, by the way. Really? Yes.

[00:21:50] What an asshole! We'll continue whatever you... But his thing was he was going to town to town,

[00:21:58] challenging different school of martial arts, and he would beat them. And for whatever reason,

[00:22:03] this one school or the one family had him as a representative, but they brought like 50 to 100

[00:22:09] henchmen to protecting him. But he waited, waited until he's sneaking and killed a bunch of people,

[00:22:13] including the kid. Because once you put kid as your representative, he had no choice but to kill the

[00:22:19] kid. Okay. He's not something like a psychopath, murderer, you know. Yeah. But so, I mean, the thing

[00:22:27] about the Tao Te Ching is, like, a lot of it's about how to live your life. Yeah. But you read

[00:22:34] that book, and I did the same thing with the European book, Mike Kump, and... Am I saying

[00:22:43] that right? How do you say that book? Wait, tell me again. What was the Hitler's book? Oh,

[00:22:48] Mike Kump. Yeah, My Struggle, yeah. My Struggle. Yeah, that's on the... That will get you looks

[00:22:56] if you want to answer it, carrying that with you. No, but it was interesting. What I remember about

[00:23:02] it was like the last... I couldn't believe Hitler did an audio book for it. Would he be a podcaster

[00:23:12] today? I think he probably would. But you'd have to get him to not... You'd be... His producer would

[00:23:17] be like, "Can you stop yelling into the mic? Hitler, just chill out a little bit." Yeah. It's

[00:23:21] going to be weird because he'll have Jewish producers, you know. Jewish producers are

[00:23:30] controlling. Yeah. I mean, he said he had an Instagram account. Jesus will have an Instagram

[00:23:35] account and a Twitter account and things like that. I mean, he probably... If he'd learned the

[00:23:43] techniques, he could probably be killing it. I mean, Andrew Tate is a controversial figure. And

[00:23:51] if you look at a lot of the tactics he's used, like the way to blow up on social media is divide

[00:23:57] and conquer. So you get half the people on board with your message and the other half hate you

[00:24:02] because of your message. In fact, hate watching, hate listening is even a big word, and the fans

[00:24:08] most likely. Probably, yeah. Yeah. I was at the Bucharest on his court date. I got the dates wrong.

[00:24:14] I got their date afterwards. You sure? Oh, wow. Okay. I went to the court. Anyway, you know,

[00:24:20] I guess we were kind of meandering. And I think, you know, we met about, what, a year and a half,

[00:24:28] two years ago? I can't even remember. Yeah. Christian, who we're at Christian's place right now,

[00:24:34] introduced us. Did we just meet that one time? The next day, we went to the coffee shop,

[00:24:41] recorded a podcast? I'm trying to reconstruct. I can't remember. Yeah, I think we did. So,

[00:24:48] basically, I just... We met and we were talking. Yeah. So it was very interesting to me because

[00:24:57] at that particular moment, I got out of a, whatever you call it nowadays, a situationship

[00:25:03] with a lady who'd been through something, let's say, a little bit Epstein-y. Yeah. Epstein-y.

[00:25:12] And it opened my eyes to a bunch of stuff I didn't know about. Yeah. Freaked me out. And I've been

[00:25:21] ranting to Christian about this stuff, about like, "Shit, there's this and there's this and

[00:25:26] there's this." And he's like, "You got to meet Yoshi." Oh, so this lady that you were hanging out,

[00:25:30] she allegedly had some kind of sexual thing that happened to her. And then she started talking

[00:25:38] about underbelly of Swiss world. Yeah. And you guys were talking about, and this is something

[00:25:44] that you were not familiar with, because I think Swiss people seem to be extremely polite and these

[00:25:49] private things are kind of hidden away, like most other places, I guess. So that's when Christian

[00:25:53] mentioned my name. That's how that started. Yeah. Okay. You were in town and he's like,

[00:25:58] he'd just say, "Dude, you've got to meet Yoshi." Okay. That makes sense. And then we just got

[00:26:04] talking. You were, and yeah, I don't know. We just sort of empty each other up on... Wait, wait. Did

[00:26:11] we meet on the day we were recording podcast or did we meet prior to that? I think we met maybe

[00:26:18] the day or two before at a bar. Okay. We were at this Irish bar, Irish pub. That's right. And then

[00:26:24] we were talking. Okay. Now I remember. We were talking like an hour or two. And then I think

[00:26:29] the next day or that we just met up at Starbucks, you were heading off somewhere. Yeah. Okay. Now I

[00:26:34] remember. Somewhere there's an audio podcast. But it was, to me, I really enjoyed the conversation

[00:26:42] we had at that podcast because it's like... I don't remember what we talked about. I don't

[00:26:46] really remember either, but it was just, there was a bunch of things about the things we were

[00:26:51] talking about where it's like, ah, it's like one old dude to another, we get. And I think

[00:26:59] I haven't seen you since then, I don't think. Have I? No, we... No. So I got here because this year,

[00:27:06] I think ever since that day, we're messaging back and forth. And I think maybe you mentioned

[00:27:13] earlier in the year, like, oh, we were talking and like, why don't you come to Switzerland and do

[00:27:18] podcasting? I wanted to come early in the year, but I just had a bunch of shit and I finally was

[00:27:22] able to make up. Yeah. Showed up November 22nd. Yeah. And well, and I like traveling this particular

[00:27:30] time of year because I don't like being in the States during Thanksgiving because I don't like

[00:27:33] hanging out with my family. And when you don't hang out with your family, all your friends say,

[00:27:38] well, you have to come to my Thanksgiving. And now I'm dragging to somebody else's family drama

[00:27:44] that I don't want to hear. And believe me, it doesn't make me sad. I like not being invited

[00:27:48] to these things because I don't want to hear all kinds of family, you know, because Thanksgiving is

[00:27:52] the time you're supposed to be thankful and spend time with your family. But that's not what happened

[00:27:56] a lot of times. They were bringing all the family grudges once a year and like, don't drag me into

[00:28:02] this. I don't want to hear your family problems, you know? So I, for the last 21 years, I think

[00:28:13] 14, 15 of those years, I'm almost in like Europe or something, because I didn't, I don't like

[00:28:20] being there. Now, Christmas you can't help anywhere. That's holiday everywhere in the world.

[00:28:25] Maybe Muslim country for whatever, you know? So I'm glad I'm here. And you want to talk to

[00:28:35] me about my previous job and things like that. I don't mind, but like, it's like people doing

[00:28:43] premieres for movies. They get asked the same stupid question over and over. You get tired

[00:28:47] of answering them. And I'm not going to say anything like different or, you know, that's why

[00:28:52] it's not that I want to talk about it. Just, I get tired of saying the same thing over and over again,

[00:28:56] you know? Yeah, I know. So, so I don't know how we're going to do this, but I asked him like,

[00:29:03] Hey, before we do the first episode, can I just ask you a bunch of questions? And I want to do

[00:29:07] with a question, you know? Yeah. Quick time out. I want to get the other gym. You could just

[00:29:18] edit this anyway, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I think we still don't even know what this

[00:29:36] thing's going to be called and you guys could do whatever with it. I don't, I don't really care. But

[00:29:42] so you're born in UK. Where in the UK? I was born in Wiesbaden in Germany. My dad was,

[00:29:51] was German near Frankfurt. Oh, okay. There's a big US air base or they used to be in Wiesbaden.

[00:30:00] And then with two, my parents divorced and my mom, who's English, took us back to

[00:30:07] live. How did your mom meet your dad? So from what I know, she was, she'd studied history at Oxford.

[00:30:17] She was a, she is a smart lady. And all those universities in the world or up there? Yeah. Yeah.

[00:30:26] And then somehow she started working for the, yeah, this would be not possible at all now.

[00:30:33] She started working for the Encyclopedia Britannica, which is... What kind of history did she study?

[00:30:38] Is it European or something? That's a good question. I've never, you know, it's weird,

[00:30:44] like these things you never really talk to your parents about. Yeah. Like I heard bits of it when

[00:30:49] I was young and now I'm busy with my life. I mean, if you don't mind, how old is your mom about?

[00:30:54] She's in about 88 now, I think. That shows what a great son I am. I think how old she is.

[00:31:04] So she was going to Oxford like late 50s, early 60s. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She, she, she was born

[00:31:11] right before World War II. And one of the things was, was her generation going through school,

[00:31:21] were very, for English as the first really problematic generation, because they all had like,

[00:31:26] like weird, I don't know, weird vibes because they'd been through the war and, and then they

[00:31:37] were like, like they were super smart, but also very hard for the teachers to manage. And then...

[00:31:46] Well, what was your mom's class? Like a middle class, lower class?

[00:31:50] Um, I, there's more or less, so we were probably upper middle class. Oh, is that right? Because

[00:31:58] my grandfather was, he was the, the bank manager of the Bank of England in Southampton, which was,

[00:32:05] it's like, Southampton is not a fantastic city, but he was the boss of the bank. So there was

[00:32:14] money around and... So I gather your, your mother's side come from a pretty good educational background.

[00:32:22] Yeah. And I mean, because going to Oxford is a very, extremely prestigious place, as you know.

[00:32:27] Yeah. And you, she probably met a lot of other future influential people as well going to Oxford.

[00:32:33] Oh yeah. She, she, occasionally when we would talk about this, we would, like I, I,

[00:32:38] she lives in Germany now with my brother and I see her that often. And

[00:32:41] um, but yeah, she, she did meet, she met some Indian dude who was, ended up very high up in

[00:32:49] Indian politics. I see. It was kind of her boyfriend for a bit. Um, she may have been,

[00:32:56] I shouldn't say this, but she was, she may have been a bit of a ho at Oxford, but she,

[00:33:03] but I don't know. It's like, it's like now she, she'd talk a lot about...

[00:33:09] Most unlikely because these days, what, what to be a whole, these days are so different than say

[00:33:16] back then. Back then just giving like a kiss or something, you know.

[00:33:20] Yeah. And so she talked about having different boyfriends, but how far that, I don't think it

[00:33:26] was, that would mean something different. But yeah, so she did that. Then she got a job out

[00:33:32] of the university working for the Encyclopedia Britannica. Right. And then I think she, I don't

[00:33:39] know why, but she got, I think she just got offered a job, a better paid job for a German

[00:33:45] encyclopedia in Wiesbaden. And then... That's where they, you know, parents met.

[00:33:52] Yeah. I see. And she was staying in a, like a rented flat and my German grandmother owned

[00:34:00] the building. And that's how she met my dad. And what's your dad's background?

[00:34:06] He, well, he's, he's dead now since years. But he, he was like a sort of a jack of all trades

[00:34:14] type of guy. He worked a little bit as a solicitor. He was laying carpet. He did a bit of everything.

[00:34:22] And I mean, they're an interesting, like, I don't, I don't really know my German family that well.

[00:34:30] Uh, cause we moved when I was so young. I got to know him a bit when I was like 18, 19.

[00:34:36] But what I got from... Wait, so you didn't grow up with your dad?

[00:34:41] No, he stayed in Germany. Oh, I see. And, uh, but what I got from the story of that is,

[00:34:50] is just like in England, cause England didn't get invaded. It's somehow through the war that

[00:34:55] got bombed a lot. It was still a certain continuity, but in Germany, things got really

[00:35:01] messed up. Like, and, um, you know, you'd have like, uh, I dunno, some dad who'd show up 10 years

[00:35:11] after the end of the war having been released from a prison in Russia. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

[00:35:16] And, uh, that wasn't the case in my family because... Your family's more on the Western side.

[00:35:23] So, uh, yeah. And generationally, none of the men lined up with the first or second world war. So

[00:35:30] they were always either too young or too old. Oh, okay. Um, but it certainly, there's some bizarre

[00:35:37] stories. Uh, like I think my German grandmother, I get this from my brother, my brother's, uh,

[00:35:46] fascinated by history. Honestly, I don't really give a shit. Yeah. Like I don't think about it

[00:35:51] much. Is he older or younger brother? He's eight years older than me. I see. And there was also a,

[00:35:57] I also had a half brother who drunk and smoke himself to death. I think my dad was a bit of a

[00:36:03] tough dude to be married to because he was so like, he was drinking a lot. Um, I think he was violent

[00:36:11] towards my mom, which is why... Well, may, may we remind the listeners that your dad grew up with

[00:36:17] a great depression in Germany and this is not particularly a great time. Exactly. And, um,

[00:36:22] not to mention Germans suffer humiliation in World War I. Yeah. And they had a just overwhelming

[00:36:29] burden to pay off that, uh, enemies that they fought. And, um, hyperinflation, I can't imagine,

[00:36:36] you know, I studied a little bit of economics. Hyperinflation is always a gift to dictators

[00:36:40] because if you have a fixed income from government, like old person, and all of a sudden every day,

[00:36:46] your money is worth less and less. Whenever you have some crazy person offering solutions like

[00:36:51] Hitler or Stalin or Mao, you end up going for these people, not because you're an evil person,

[00:36:56] but because you're afraid for your livelihood, you know, or your life. So, um, yeah, that's actually

[00:37:01] really interesting you put it that way. Like if you think about it, because you read about that

[00:37:06] in history, but if I think like the money I get paid every month is like going downhill and some

[00:37:12] dude is saying, hey, do this, like follow me. I'm going to make sure you keep your money. I'm like,

[00:37:18] fuck yes. Cause I got kids to look after. And I think this is something that, uh,

[00:37:22] Democratic party in the United States forgot because recently, you know, they're typically

[00:37:26] trying to make all kinds of cultural issues as like the topic, but at the end of the day,

[00:37:29] if you're poor, middle class, what is the biggest thing you're concerned about your livelihood? Are

[00:37:34] you able to take care of yourself, your families, economic? And whether you like Trump or not,

[00:37:38] most people live better economic condition prior to COVID, you know? So, um, I think,

[00:37:43] I think they forgot about that, you know, and I think, um, to call like 90 I worked for Michael

[00:37:52] Dukakis campaign, Democratic nominee. I made him, I worked on it. I just graduated from high school

[00:37:58] because back then I still care about working class cause I grew up poor.

[00:38:04] And I thought I know how to pick a winner. No, I've been wrong every election, you know,

[00:38:10] but I think when Bill Clinton became president, this is a reason why so many people hate him,

[00:38:17] Republicans, because no question Bill Clinton is a political genius army, unbelievable performer

[00:38:26] and an intelligent guy. And he understand politics really well. He took all the good

[00:38:31] idea that Republican has taken away and added to his administration. And I don't know why

[00:38:37] Republicans are mad. He's, he's, he's giving less power to union, lower tax, international trade.

[00:38:43] But, but, but I think, I think they pay heavy price because they really throw working class

[00:38:51] under the bus, you know? And I think that's why when you call mega rally people racist,

[00:38:56] they're not racist. Some of them maybe, I mean, rich people are racist too. It just, these are

[00:39:01] working class. They're just scared for their family and Democrats just forgot about them.

[00:39:05] So they went to Trump's camp. Even though Trump probably not going to do anything for them either,

[00:39:11] but at least he listened to them, you know? You can't just ignore poor people that gets cool

[00:39:16] or expecting black people to keep voting for your party because taking people for granted,

[00:39:22] it's never a good policy, you know? So, yeah, I think an interesting angle on the Clinton thing.

[00:39:29] Okay. Well first, yeah. So I used to know this guy who worked for, later on when I worked for

[00:39:35] the Clinton foundation. Yeah. I probably shouldn't mention his name because he may be, this is just

[00:39:43] don't mention it. And it's also sort of name that might get people whacked like me or something,

[00:39:49] but he, cause he ended up being involved in selling a Canadian nuclear power plant

[00:39:55] to a Russian oligarch through the Clinton foundation. And it was interesting that how

[00:40:00] I got to know him, I was still at university then and I had a lot of friends in London. I was at a

[00:40:07] university just outside and these guys were at the London school of economics. It was a good friend

[00:40:13] of mine. He went and I got to meet all these dudes who were then going to become the future like

[00:40:20] ambassadors for America and this kind of stuff. And they were a mad bunch of people. And they,

[00:40:26] like for them, London was a playground. They're getting their good master's degrees from the

[00:40:32] London school of economics. Mick Jagger went there too. To the London school of economics?

[00:40:36] Yeah. I didn't know that. That's why Roland Stone is interesting to me because not only is he

[00:40:42] creative musically, performance wise, acting and things like that, but he's one of the few of them

[00:40:48] with a really good head for business. Famously when they were having tax issues, they moved

[00:40:52] to Southern France. Remember that? And the girl that I was hanging out yesterday, she was telling

[00:40:58] me her best friend in Amsterdam worked for accounting firm to take care of Mick Jagger's

[00:41:03] account. Wow. So yeah, he has a head for business, you know, but this was an interesting thing

[00:41:10] because, you know, you talk about conspiracies. In the end, a conspiracy is just a bunch of people

[00:41:16] that know each other. It's like, you could say there's a comedy conspiracy. So for example,

[00:41:21] if I, if I run a venue and we're good friends, I'm like, Hey, Yoshi, come and do this show. So

[00:41:28] that's a form of conspiracy. I'm doing you a favor because we like each other, whatever,

[00:41:32] or vice versa. What does that mean anyway? Like when you say conspiracy, like two or more people

[00:41:39] trying to do something without public knowing, I don't, I'm not really not familiar with it

[00:41:46] because everybody keeps talking about it. I just use that word without really not knowing anything.

[00:41:50] I've got a, I've got a sort of context. I studied physics and physics, physics is one of the

[00:41:58] greatest. But once we finished it, we should go back to your background, you know? All right. Yeah.

[00:42:01] But it just, I mean, this is part of the background. I studied physics and physics

[00:42:05] teaches you systems thinking. It's a very, physics is a very good, uh, set of mental

[00:42:12] tools for like analyzing stuff. Um, and, and so when I say I have a theory, that means I've

[00:42:20] thought this stuff through, I've got a theory of why they really took down Julian Assange.

[00:42:26] And it wasn't so much the leaks as his under the idea behind WikiLeaks. Um, and he created,

[00:42:34] he published this master's paper. So I've worked in software all my life. Yeah. He created a

[00:42:39] definition of a conspiracy that a computer scientist understands. I want to hear it.

[00:42:44] And he says, basically, uh, a conspiracy is a bit like the internet. Like the internet is made up of

[00:42:51] all these routers that are connected to each other, sharing data. Uh, and a conspiracy is a similar

[00:42:58] thing. It's a bunch of people that are acting in a certain way towards a certain agenda. Right.

[00:43:04] The reason why I think they took him down, you can find this thing online still is he said,

[00:43:12] just like a computer network where you can, there's certain ways to attack a computer network

[00:43:18] by overloading parts of the network. Okay. He published this manifesto, which is like,

[00:43:24] here's how you take down a conspiracy theory is you get the different actors in the conspiracy

[00:43:31] to stop trusting each other so that they overload each other. And wait, wait. So,

[00:43:37] so if that group of people believe in conspiracy a you create problem within that group basically.

[00:43:45] Yeah. For him, a conspiracy is like, uh, I don't know, you're trying to steal everybody's money

[00:43:53] around the world and you're a bunch of people. You don't really like each other, but you work together

[00:43:58] to, to, towards a common goal and trying to keep it hidden. Uh, now what he did,

[00:44:06] the greatest example of this was when he did, uh, the embassy leaks. Do you remember the heat? So

[00:44:13] the embassy leaks really leaked a bunch of us diplomatic cables. Okay. Um, there was the other

[00:44:19] leaks that were more famous, but this one, Hillary Clinton was, was us foreign secretary at the time.

[00:44:25] Yeah. If she spent a year running around the world, apologizing to every nation or at least

[00:44:33] forcing them to get back on board because. Apologizing about, about why?

[00:44:39] Because, uh, what, what Julian Assange leaked was all the shit that people, the,

[00:44:44] the U S embassy system had been talking about different countries. Oh, and they were talking a

[00:44:49] shit about, but, but, uh, yeah, not just, not just being assholes. It's like, here's how we're going

[00:44:54] to fuck these guys. It was, and he, he leaked all of that stuff. And it, and it was like countries

[00:45:01] that regarded themselves as us allies were finding out, Hey, like the Americans are doing this. And

[00:45:07] Julian Assange's goal in this was to any, and he did it for about two years. There was no time for

[00:45:17] America to start a new war because the whole like, like foreign system was tied up in cleaning up the

[00:45:26] mess that he caused. And so this is a completely opposite situation. Right after nine 11, the whole

[00:45:32] world want to help America. And of course that idiots squander that goodwill and start killing

[00:45:38] people in Afghanistan, Iran. Yeah. Yeah. But, and, and, but it's basically what Julian Assange

[00:45:46] described is a kind of a, it's like a, it's like how to, a hacker's attack for how to bring down

[00:45:53] powerful systems. Yeah. Um, and it works and it, and if, if more people knew about it,

[00:46:01] who have brains, we could, we could basically eliminate power structures.

[00:46:07] But isn't it interesting when you have something like a paradise paper and there was a lady named

[00:46:12] Daphne, something from, um, the Island in middle of Mediterranean, um, not Epstein's Island. No,

[00:46:23] no, no. Okay. It's, it's, it's an Island where, um, Mediterranean. Oh, uh, with the English Gibraltar. Malta.

[00:46:31] Malta. Yeah. I was there too. And, um, she, she was assassinated, but because she participated in

[00:46:38] paradise paper about findings and things like that. But it's really interesting because it was. Paradise

[00:46:43] paper or Panama paper? There's both of, there's two of them. Oh, the paradise paper I don't know about.

[00:46:48] It's the, I don't want to say some of the names because they're friends with Russell Peters,

[00:46:52] but these, these important people representing certain country have access amount of money and

[00:46:58] they turn around and go different parts of world buying property for themselves and there was

[00:47:02] release and, you know, you expect certain subject live in your country. They're poor expecting the

[00:47:11] king care, king or whoever it is, care for them, but they're spending money like crazy overseas.

[00:47:16] Anyway, it's, it's, it's really embarrassing, but it always go back to my background, which is

[00:47:21] how you discredit these people with conspiracy or explaining the rest of the world. These powerful

[00:47:27] people are doing something. You, you always get, you silence them through sex scandals or accuse

[00:47:33] them about sexual assault. You know, it's the most common thing that regular people understand.

[00:47:38] Like whether it's true or not, you call somebody rapist, you know, damage is done, you know, but I

[00:47:47] noticed that sex allegations are one of the most cost effective way to discredit someone.

[00:47:53] This is actually an interesting thing because in the, I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm not

[00:48:01] saying it did happen or didn't happen. I'm just saying it's, it's a powerful way to discredit

[00:48:07] someone. And I forgot there was some Russian revolutionary said it's, I'm paraphrasing. It's

[00:48:14] not only necessary to kill your enemies, but you have to first dishonor them. In other words,

[00:48:19] you do more harm by, it's worse than death. You hurt their reputation, you know.

[00:48:24] But here, see, this is an interesting thing because I wonder now, does anybody care about

[00:48:31] honor anymore? Like, like I was having this conversation earlier this week with a couple

[00:48:37] of people. I have to say, I find it's funny with through comedy, I meet a lot of people younger

[00:48:42] than me. And we are all fuckers. Yeah. And, and, and so this is how I, you know, stay cool and stay

[00:48:52] in touch. We're not cool. Yeah, we're fucking cool. Anyway, we're cooler than anyway. And

[00:49:01] one thing that surprises me, at least in Switzerland is you meet someone who's like

[00:49:09] 25 and within 15 minutes they're telling you about their personal BDSM fetishes. Yeah. But

[00:49:17] to me, what seems to be a very big taboo amongst young people is to say, I actually have genuine

[00:49:24] feelings for you. And it's like, but, but if so, I don't know. Say that again. You actually have

[00:49:33] genuine feelings, someone like I love you or I care about you. They say that or they can't say it?

[00:49:39] I don't, they can't say it. To me, that feels like the biggest taboo. They sometimes pretend to say

[00:49:45] with all kinds of things that, oh, I feel you, man, but that's bullshit. I love, I love this.

[00:49:50] And just hold your thought and finish what you have to say. But this is one of the reasons

[00:49:55] it changed my life because anyone who's listening to this, I don't know anything about you or myself.

[00:50:02] I work in adult business, AKA porn business full-time. And I was watching a lot of those

[00:50:07] movies and make sure they're presentable for DVDs and things like that. And the part of the problem

[00:50:13] is like when you see naked people all the time and they're having sex, eventually you don't even

[00:50:18] notice it anymore because I've seen it so many times. There's nothing really special about that.

[00:50:23] You literally take intimacy out of the whole thing. I think probably like halfway through

[00:50:31] working for the company, Evo Angel, I was working for them, my friend Aiden, one of the directors

[00:50:38] still for Evo Angel, he started doing this behind the scene where, okay, the girls just have sex

[00:50:42] with a guy, showered, afterwards they're kind of having a conversation. It doesn't necessarily

[00:50:49] like performances. They just literally like talk to him for a long time. And I don't think he did

[00:50:56] it on purpose, but this is like the porno version of what Joe Rogan is doing, which is like, yeah,

[00:51:01] you could watch somebody fuck for like 10, 15, 20 minutes or whatever, but you don't really know

[00:51:04] them until you talk to them. And Aiden, there's something really interesting when you talk to

[00:51:09] these performers, both men and women or transgender person, sometimes 30, 40, 50 minutes or even an

[00:51:15] hour kind of sitting in a couch talking about stuff. And that was part of the behind the scenes.

[00:51:19] Really, when they have a good conversation, they're finding it naked to me. Like being physical naked

[00:51:30] doesn't mean anything. But once they stop playing a character, a whore or stud, and they start talking

[00:51:40] as a person and they talk something personal about themselves and what led them to do porn,

[00:51:45] to me, that was the most interesting part of my job later on because you get kind of, you know, like

[00:51:51] a lot of my friends think that was a great job. You get to watch porn all the time. It's really

[00:51:57] exhausting after a while because I don't care what kind of wonderful fantasy you have, as soon as you

[00:52:04] bring work and job into it, it's not fantasy anymore. It's just, it's a miserable thing now.

[00:52:09] You know, you got to work and really, I think working for that business changed my life because

[00:52:18] I think you start seeing these people like the way they really are, you know, because I think

[00:52:23] this is a completely different for like 99% of the consumer pornography. Like I knew these people

[00:52:29] and when they, something happened to them or when they passed away and I know there's a lot of dark

[00:52:36] humor out there, like my friends would tell me like, "Oh, x1c porn, I'm gonna watch your porn

[00:52:41] and jack up there," and I would never tell them not to do anything just because I understand dark

[00:52:46] humor too, but it's a little different when you worked on those movies. It's a little different

[00:52:50] when you knew them and it's a little different when you're close to them and see them pass away

[00:52:55] and you know their families and friends and things like that, you know. So, it did a lot of weird

[00:53:02] things, I guess. It took me places that I wasn't expecting to and when I did Enbro Show

[00:53:08] last year, the name of the show is "Adult Content" and I think people thought it's all going to be

[00:53:14] about pornographic stories, but it's misunderstanding of that phrase "adult content." I thought it means

[00:53:22] adult content, like how to be happy as an adult and then it kind of become that because

[00:53:30] whether working at the retail store and talking to these customers, lonely people, a big chunk of it,

[00:53:37] life is a little more complicated. It's easy to just categorize and call everybody pervert

[00:53:42] and I guess there's a big chunk of that too, but I think more than anything, I think the vast

[00:53:50] majority of people who consume pornography are not pervert. I think they're very lonely people

[00:53:57] and they're having a hard time making connections and it was a weirdly, it gave me opportunity to be

[00:54:07] decent to people, you know, because I'm not very decent to stand up comedy show at times because I

[00:54:12] do a lot of mean shit on stage a lot of time, but I think working in the porn shop, working at the

[00:54:17] convention floor, whenever I was helping television show, movie show in Hollywood,

[00:54:26] I would show the side that public don't really see, you know, and I think

[00:54:32] yeah, it changed my life, you know. That's an interesting thing that they were most, I like

[00:54:41] porn on people because when they're most naked to me, I don't care about the nudity and stuff. I'm

[00:54:46] sick of that shit, you know, but I think when I get to know them, you see them really different.

[00:54:51] It's just, they're just playing characters on the stage, really. I mean, this is interesting.

[00:54:57] Let me build up to a question. So, like I said, this is like, you know, we don't have

[00:55:04] an agenda what we're going to talk about. Yeah, we just ramble a little bit. I started in comedy

[00:55:09] about, it's now almost eight years, and the first year. My life rises. It was getting dumped by a

[00:55:18] Swiss woman, which, I mean, okay, it might be kind of midlife crisis. There are other reasons,

[00:55:27] like I also wanted a social life, but it was just a point with like, I just had this energy.

[00:55:34] I was so, there's so much like anger and confusion and other stuff, and I just need to let some energy

[00:55:43] out somewhere. And like, yeah, anyway, that's kind of a side quest if we go down there. But

[00:55:52] the first couple of years, I was very conflicted about how I felt about presenting myself on stage,

[00:56:01] because- What do you mean?

[00:56:04] Because you're opening yourself to a lot of judgment. I mean, Patrice, I remember he has a,

[00:56:14] I think it's in a Mark Maron interview where he talks about like, when you do comedy,

[00:56:19] it's like people see the laughter in this, but you gave a piece of your soul to all those people.

[00:56:26] Something undeserving.

[00:56:30] Yeah. I mean, and they're going to go and make their interpretation of you. You've

[00:56:36] left something of yourself, and it's nothing tangible, but it's still,

[00:56:41] you're in other people's heads. Like today we met this woman, I couldn't even remember her face,

[00:56:46] but she's like, "Oh, Harry, I know." And I'm like, "Okay." But it was, for me, it took a couple of

[00:56:55] years. And it's just finally, I just, the maths I did in my head is like, I'm at a certain age,

[00:57:01] I don't give a shit. But to get to the question, is there a similar thing in porn? The assumption

[00:57:13] I have is that a lot of people get into porn because of trauma, because it's an easy way to

[00:57:20] make money, so it's a mix of trauma and money. But then there's also this line of shame. Like,

[00:57:28] what is the journey into porn? Like, you saw people, like, is it...

[00:57:36] I mean, the common thing they keep saying that they want to explore their sexuality.

[00:57:42] Yeah. I never bought that shit.

[00:57:43] It's empowerment.

[00:57:45] Empowerment.

[00:57:46] I'm sorry, but I... I'm sure it's true for some of them. And it is easy money, I guess,

[00:57:56] especially like 20 years ago when I started working for Evil Angel in 2003, 21 years ago.

[00:58:01] It was kind of, unless I got to know them, you know, like, I mean, I take their words

[00:58:13] for what it is. When I talk to my friend Peter Warren from AVN, he thinks 100% of all the

[00:58:21] performers, female especially, they've been molested. That's why they're getting into

[00:58:25] business. I don't know if it's that high, but whatever it is, I always try to have respect for

[00:58:32] them. And if they choose to, once they choose to do it, there's no point trying to shame somebody,

[00:58:39] you know, I work in the business, you know? Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think, yeah, my

[00:58:43] bullshit reaction is like, when I think of like, what is the word empowerment? It's that you have

[00:58:51] actual power. And maybe it feels like you have power if you're a porn star, but the real power

[00:59:01] is with whoever is making the big money. And then actual power in the world is with people that have

[00:59:10] guns on their side and soldiers. So this word empowerment is like, it's kind of a lie in itself.

[00:59:17] It's a little weird because I think, especially from like early 90s, after the Cold War ended,

[00:59:26] you have a lot of these Eastern European performers, you know, and they're doing a completely

[00:59:30] different thing because growing up in Europe, they don't have hang up about sex and nudity.

[00:59:34] But if they're from Eastern Europe and they're in porn back then, it's probably more like financial

[00:59:38] reasons, you know, because a lot of money they got is just staggering because you could never

[00:59:42] make that kind of money in the States. So I think I had a tendency to, I'm just more sympathetic to

[00:59:53] Eastern European performers because if you do it right, if you work long enough and save enough

[00:59:58] money, you could go back to Europe. It's a generational wealth. It could change your family's

[01:00:02] destiny, you know. But if you're living, if you're born in America and you have all these

[01:00:08] opportunities to get into porn, they get a little complicated. Like, you know, you could have got

[01:00:12] an acting or got a degree and become a doctor or whatnot, you know. But at the end of the day,

[01:00:19] it's not really my place to ask them unless I got to know them because my job was basically

[01:00:25] post-production DVDs, you know. I think 2003 to 2007, I probably saw a lot of performers showing

[01:00:32] up to the office. But by 2009 and 10, I hardly ever saw too many people showing up to the office,

[01:00:38] you know. Because by then, a lot of online stuff was changing the business. But it's so different

[01:00:44] now. It's a completely different business. I'm having a hard time reading and figuring out what's

[01:00:49] going on in the business, you know. It's a different animal, you know. Yeah. Only fans. Yeah. I mean,

[01:00:55] the power has shifted away from production to porn girls, you know. Which is good. Yeah,

[01:01:00] definitely. I mean, I send you that. I send you that thing. There's this lady blowing up on TikTok,

[01:01:05] Angela Blue or something. Oh, yeah. I find her a very attractive lady. And she's very attractive.

[01:01:11] And she's kind of done the Andrew Tate approach. She's trolling. Exactly. She's trolling. She's

[01:01:19] saying going around to schools, fucking 18 year old boys. Now she's moved on to dance. She's like,

[01:01:24] come to this hotel if you're a dad. Yeah. I don't care if you're married. And then they make a video

[01:01:30] out of this. Yeah. And it's trolling. Yeah. Because everyone's like, it's causing a reaction. Yeah. And

[01:01:38] to me, she's not a whore. To me, she's a smart businesswoman that she knows how to get attention,

[01:01:43] make money, you know. Because I think, you know, my personal opinion is like, you do things,

[01:01:50] and it doesn't bother you whether you become an actor or a comedian or a porn star. But you don't

[01:01:56] want your kids to do the same thing and go through the suffering, you know. But if you do it, if you

[01:02:00] become a porn star, you make millions of dollars, you lose maybe public respect for you. And people

[01:02:07] might think, doesn't think too much of you. But if you make enough money to take care of your family

[01:02:12] kids for generations to come, you know, like, good for her, you know. I really think it depends on

[01:02:20] why you did it, really. Yeah, I guess. I mean, it's not my place to tell them how to live their

[01:02:28] lives, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I buy the friend that you mentioned said 100%

[01:02:35] have some kind of child. Because the thing is, I think, I think for people, most people, the idea

[01:02:43] of, like, or if I put it in, this is a male point of view, but like, like, in periods in my life

[01:02:51] where I've been, like, fucking around, basically, with different, different women, there's a certain

[01:02:57] point where my body's just like, like, like, even my dick is like, dude, who the fuck is this? I'm

[01:03:03] not even interested. And just because it's like, the intimacy, you get to know someone, you get

[01:03:12] some depth, that's, like, I'm more turned on by someone that I've been with for six months. And

[01:03:18] then we know each other, physically, we know each other. And then, yeah, and so sleeping around,

[01:03:26] it's like, it's confusing to the body. It's confusing, but I've been telling you too. And

[01:03:31] I think, I think, I think the first couple, I don't know, maybe first time I told you, you laughed,

[01:03:36] but I think sex is really overrated, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and when people say,

[01:03:44] you work in porn business for a long time, you know, so many people in business, you must have

[01:03:47] a weird fetish. And I was thinking like, you know, my, these days, my fetish is like, girl,

[01:03:52] showing up on time. Stop yelling at me, you know, stop nagging. Those are the fetishes. We don't,

[01:03:59] you don't even have to take your clothes off. It's not, we're not gonna have a good sex anyway.

[01:04:03] I'm 55, wait, wait. You know, at a certain point, like, you know, it's, it's just, just,

[01:04:11] it's grossly exaggerated, because after you have sex, like, all that hassle to get it,

[01:04:16] dinner, movies, and stuff, it's just so much headache. Yeah, I mean, it's actually,

[01:04:21] I love that point of view, because we were talking about that on the phone. I thought it's hilarious,

[01:04:26] because, because I'm not, I'm trying not to be ironic, but like, I know, but you know, like,

[01:04:32] but if I, if I look back at my life, the amount of time and effort I've put into getting laid,

[01:04:37] and, and it's never been anything, okay, once or twice, it's been like, okay, that was an

[01:04:43] interesting experience. Yeah. But generally speaking, it's never been, it's never been

[01:04:47] worth the effort. It's like, and, and if I think about how much better my life would be if I hadn't

[01:04:55] had a dick chasing women around. Yeah. I mean, it's a paradox. I became a dad through that. Yeah.

[01:05:01] And when becoming a dad, made me a much better person, like a much more able to handle stress,

[01:05:09] much less. When you're caring for someone, sure, it has a civilizing effect, I think.

[01:05:15] It, but it forced me to level up in big ways. Yeah. Because the first thing and, and the first

[01:05:24] thing is just, I remember like with my daughter, I think, and she's like three months old and she's,

[01:05:32] you know, I'm lying next to her, she's asleep in bed. And I've just got this terror of like,

[01:05:39] fuck, I'm responsible for this life now. And it's like, that means I can't die. Yeah. I have to

[01:05:46] make sure this thing lives. And that's, and, and that was the first time I've ever had that

[01:05:53] kind of responsibility. But then the other side of that is I don't look after myself very well,

[01:06:00] or I don't even stand up for myself in most situations. It takes me years to learn to,

[01:06:07] when someone's doing some bullshit towards me to say, fuck off. But if somebody

[01:06:11] does the same shit to my kids, I've become a person who maybe would be willing to do anything.

[01:06:21] Like, of course. And to me, that's fascinating because this is, it's this animal energy. It's

[01:06:26] like, oh, you fuck with my kids. That's where it's like soprano level energy. And that's

[01:06:34] fascinating to me because, yeah, I don't know where I'm going with this now, but it's just like,

[01:06:41] like, I've benefited a lot from having kids because it made me maybe a more powerful human

[01:06:48] being like, like, because otherwise I was just have been gaming and doing bullshit and like,

[01:06:55] you know. One of my, one of my friend, Tom, when I met him within five minutes, I want to,

[01:07:02] he was a friend of my other close friend. And then my other friend knew Tom would just piss

[01:07:09] me off right away. So he deliberately brought him knowing that he's going to piss me off.

[01:07:13] And I fucking hated it. But after he got married and had kids, he had to civilize. In fact,

[01:07:17] he's a good man. He's a good father, good husband. And it kind of shocked him because

[01:07:21] I never thought he had it in him to do that. But, you know, marriage for some people really works.

[01:07:27] Yeah.

[01:07:28] Having kids for people works, you know. And, all right. Difficult question. Why does it,

[01:07:35] how did, what's the thing that pisses you off? What do you do when you get pissed off?

[01:07:40] Like, how did Tom piss you off?

[01:07:44] Oh, it's been, oh, he was just like some mocking me and just harassed me right away. But

[01:07:48] I don't remember exactly all the detail. Or I remember at the time, just like 90 or 91,

[01:07:56] I just met him. My friend Fred was giggling because he knew he was, Tom's going to irritate me.

[01:08:01] He just wanted to bring him and introduce me so he'll irritate me.

[01:08:04] Oh, so he's like one of these comedians that's on a permanent-

[01:08:07] No, they're not comedians. They're just regular guys.

[01:08:09] But you know, you get, I don't mean that, but he was like he's on a permanent roast battle.

[01:08:13] So he's roasting-

[01:08:14] He was just, Tom was being a dick at the time, you know.

[01:08:16] And my whole reaction at the time was, I'm just going to get a pencil, just stab me in the eye.

[01:08:21] That was my reaction. But it's amazing. His daughter just had a daughter. So he's a grandfather

[01:08:29] now.

[01:08:30] Holy shit.

[01:08:31] Among my friends, I think he's the first grandfather. Kind of weirdly weird to say that.

[01:08:38] But do you have kids?

[01:08:40] No, no, no. I don't have kids.

[01:08:44] Because you strike me as someone that might be 50 kids around the world.

[01:08:49] No, no, no. I had an inkling early on that I'll be a terrible father.

[01:08:56] And I don't have a very close relationship with my parents. They're not bad people,

[01:09:01] but they were not good parents. And I'm not a good son either.

[01:09:04] But good parenting is like pornography. You know it when you see it. And then my mother

[01:09:13] was basically, I think she was kind of pushed to marry my dad. So I think it's not a fun thing

[01:09:21] to say, but I think every time she saw me, it reminded her of happiness. So she's a very

[01:09:29] atypical Asian mother because most Asian mothers were sacrificing their lives for their kids.

[01:09:33] She was complete opposite. She just didn't give a shit about that. She was drinking a lot too.

[01:09:38] Does it, you're reminding me of the, okay, I refer to her as laws and ladies.

[01:09:45] The crazy one that I met before I met you. And this is a conversation she had as well.

[01:09:52] It's like, I don't want to have children because I don't want this line to continue

[01:09:59] because there is a fucked upness in this family that I don't want to pass on to.

[01:10:04] I mean, I guess technically somebody could ask me, could you move away and not do what

[01:10:11] your parents did? But the reality is I am my dad and my mother's son.

[01:10:16] So you're making a Darwinian choice for the human race in a way.

[01:10:19] Yeah. I don't take pleasure hurting people. And I feel a little weird about bringing a life.

[01:10:30] So I had a vasectomy in like late nineties. So that guaranteed that I'm not going to have kids.

[01:10:40] I mean, there's times when I see a couple of my friend's kids like, well, they're amazing kids.

[01:10:44] It doesn't make me think like it would have been wonderful to have a kid because they're such a

[01:10:47] sweet kids, you know, my friend, Mikey, his daughter, Gabby, second kid in the family.

[01:10:55] And she's a beautiful girl, very funny, but she makes me laugh because she does

[01:11:02] gymnastic and their coach is a gay black guy. And I know why that's funny, but it makes me laugh.

[01:11:11] A gay black coach teaching ballet. Gymnastic. And I don't remember what he said.

[01:11:19] Perfection or, you know, you have to do the drill better or, you know,

[01:11:28] I don't know what he said. But she turned around and said, oh, you mean like you're losing your

[01:11:37] hair in the middle of your, something about this gay black guy's look that he fought so hard to hide.

[01:11:46] But teenage girls are terrified because they know all your insecurity.

[01:11:50] She made this guy cry. And most adults will say, Gabby, that's terrible. I couldn't stop laughing.

[01:11:58] Good for you. I wish I had the money to give it to her. Yeah. Go to the world and hurt people's

[01:12:04] feelings. That's what I was telling this girl. So if I had a daughter like that, oh my God,

[01:12:09] she's so sassy and like sarcastic. I love kids like that. But boy, teenage kids are so good at

[01:12:17] detecting your weakness and they just stab you. But yeah, every time I see her or when Mikey

[01:12:26] told me, guess what my daughter did this week, I can't stop laughing. So if I had a kid like that,

[01:12:31] good, fine. That's wonderful. But knowing myself, I'll probably have some miserable prick as a kid

[01:12:38] because I was a miserable prick as a kid. I guess, well, to apropos your point, my daughter,

[01:12:45] I don't argue with my daughter anymore because- Never fight a war you can't win.

[01:12:51] Exactly. You're not going to beat a teenage girl at that. Well, she's 21 now. She knows all my

[01:12:59] insecurities at a primal level. She's grown up with them from the age of a kid and like a two-year-old,

[01:13:09] they don't listen to anything you say. They read your soul. She's like Scientology. She knows your

[01:13:16] dark secret, know how to exploit you. Exactly. When the fights begin, she'll press something

[01:13:25] and it's like, oh man, she remembers. But the thing is, I guess the thing that people should

[01:13:37] know about parenting is that when, especially when they're young, I was thinking about why

[01:13:43] does so many people fuck up as parents. I think mostly I didn't fuck up because I looked at where

[01:13:51] I was in my life. I'm like, this is the one thing I'm determined not to fuck this up. The early stages

[01:14:00] where the kids up to the age of about eight, it's like going back to stone age times. We live in this

[01:14:10] beautiful modern world where you can get a green tea frappuccino and this kind of stuff, but then

[01:14:14] you have kids and you're wiping human shit off every day. You're dealing with this thing that

[01:14:22] screams. Who's older, a boy or a girl? The girl is older. Thank God it's better to have an older

[01:14:28] daughter because she sets a more calm tone. Then you're woken up. There was three years where I got

[01:14:37] maximum three hours sleep a night because my daughter would wake up crying or my son.

[01:14:43] Yeah. I remember this one time, it's summertime. It's hot. It's 3 a.m. I'm like a zombie.

[01:14:53] My daughter woke up. She's crying. I'm rocking her in my arms back to sleep. I'm stood in front

[01:15:00] of this window because it's hot and it's like some cool air blowing in. Then this little voice

[01:15:06] in my head says, "Dude, the window's right there. You can solve this problem right now." Just like,

[01:15:13] "Yeah." I was horrified that that creature existed in me. That's like the nature of the human soul.

[01:15:25] You get brought up with small children. They bring you to the most animal level.

[01:15:31] Which led to Louis C.K.'s success in the beginning because one of the things that really changed his

[01:15:37] career, he was saying something about seeing a parent punching a kid or hurting a kid. If you

[01:15:47] didn't have a kid, you would say, "That's terrible." As a father, he'd say, "I understand." Then the

[01:15:53] audience laughed. That kind of nuanced honesty is what led to Louis' success.

[01:16:05] To me, that's always a thing. I think there's a point. In my brain, it's somewhere between

[01:16:12] 30 and 40, most people discover that they're not a nice person. Up until 30, most people are living

[01:16:21] in a bubble of, "I'm a nice person. I do good." Ignoring all the times, they do shitty things to

[01:16:28] people. Then you've got a nice Jungian shadow self. It's about creating unity between your

[01:16:36] good and your bad, whatever. This is funny coming from you because he was living in Switzerland as

[01:16:40] well. Yeah. It's just coming from a point of arrogance. Being a physicist, I think psychology,

[01:16:53] fundamentally, I believe psychology is bullshit. I grew up in England. We used to laugh about how

[01:17:05] all the Americans need to see a therapist. I could be wrong. One of my understanding why

[01:17:18] Stalin hated Jews, one of many reasons. I think one of the things that he really hated for

[01:17:24] psychotherapy, which is a religion for some Jewish people. It's become a global religion now.

[01:17:30] Yeah, because I think to Stalin, it was a dangerous thing that people get into his head.

[01:17:36] Also, the thing is the brain is not subtractive. It's only additive.

[01:17:45] What does that mean? If I say to you, "Don't think of a huge black cock right now."

[01:17:51] You can't not do things. Well, this is a little tricky because I'm always thinking about that.

[01:17:58] Don't think of an elephant. You can't unthink. You can only add more bullshit.

[01:18:09] Then eventually, you lose interest. That's the best you can do. I forgot the point about this.

[01:18:17] Oh, yeah. All this stuff where the more you think about something, the more it becomes a thing.

[01:18:26] If I'm 40 and I'm just like, "Yeah, I had a happy childhood," and I'm not thinking about it at all,

[01:18:35] great, fine. Then somebody comes along and says, "Yeah, but you must have had this experience in

[01:18:41] your childhood." You start thinking about, "Oh, yeah, this thing happened."

[01:18:45] I think social media is probably making things worse for everyone, for a lot of people, I think.

[01:18:49] Yeah. The thing is, I've worked in the software of my life. To me,

[01:18:55] you know the idea of a mantra like this with-

[01:19:00] Repeating something over and over?

[01:19:02] Yeah. In Asian or Eastern mysticism, you've got the om or the thing,

[01:19:08] "Hare Krishna," whatever the stuff they're saying. To me, the realization is in my early 40s,

[01:19:17] I stopped hearing my mom's voice. My mom's voice wasn't terribly judging, but there was some

[01:19:26] judgment and there were some things that I realized it's like this piece of software,

[01:19:33] or it's like a chat GPT of my mom telling me how I should live my life. At a certain point,

[01:19:40] that software stops. It expires. It reaches its sell-by date.

[01:19:44] It's really weird saying that. It's not the same thing, but

[01:19:48] I don't even remember what my dad's voice sounds now. I could still see his face in my head, but

[01:19:56] it really faded away.

[01:19:57] I think that's fundamentally a good thing, but then if you go and see a therapist and you talk

[01:20:03] about your dad for three hours a week, then it keeps it alive. It's supposed to fade away, I think.

[01:20:12] Yeah. I guess talking about problem all the time probably doesn't help.

[01:20:15] I guess I don't know what's the healthy level because I don't think holding on to all your

[01:20:21] problems and talking about it and thinking about it isn't healthy either, but talking over thinking,

[01:20:26] Socrates say unexamined life is not worth living, but over-examined life is not worth living either.

[01:20:34] I don't know what's the happy medium. I think that's the difficult thing to figure out.

[01:20:38] Nobody's said that before. The over-examined life is not worth living.

[01:20:44] This is your philosophy here. You need to be a new Socrates.

[01:20:51] Socrates 2.0. That's a great quote.

[01:20:54] No, no. What I'm saying is if you're going from LA to New York City,

[01:20:58] there's many different ways of doing it. The easiest one is flying from LA to New York.

[01:21:02] You could drive, you could hitchhike, you could take a bus, you could take a boat long way around,

[01:21:07] or you get paralyzed by planning for all the potential problems on the way driving,

[01:21:13] so you're trying to prevent that, so you're over-preparing, but eventually you have to leave.

[01:21:18] That's the problem. Some people leave without preparation, and other people over-prepare,

[01:21:24] but eventually life has to go, so you have to go. You can't anticipate all the problems.

[01:21:30] The thing is, I say this about therapy because I've always had this reactionary thing. I think

[01:21:39] it's my family with Quakers. When I hear everybody say, "Oh, you need to do therapy," I'm like,

[01:21:48] "Fuck therapy." It's like, "Don't tell me what I need to do, first of all," but the other thing is

[01:21:54] more... Therapy could be different things, right? Some people talk to therapists, but other people

[01:22:01] like to exercise and running, or they could get coffee and read a book or something like that,

[01:22:06] too. Yeah, Swiss is all about the running. They run and they hike. For me, therapy is chat GPT.

[01:22:15] There's a thing I did two days ago. Have you heard this notion of prompts?

[01:22:24] I don't know what that is. I don't do any of the AIs. I have a face that looks like saying,

[01:22:31] "I do AI and high tech." I do none of that stuff. My expertise is transgender porn,

[01:22:38] so this is what we're talking about here. First of all, I asked chat GPT about you.

[01:22:47] It knows about you because- It doesn't know me. They just know a lot of facts about me.

[01:22:52] Yeah, but- It doesn't know me.

[01:22:55] You think. Well, so here's what I did. There's a thing called the God prompt. Chat GPT by default

[01:23:06] gives you like a basic, it's like a basic bitch basically. But then if you tell it how it should

[01:23:12] behave and what things it should do, you can get very, and these are called prompts. So you say,

[01:23:18] "I want you to act as like Socrates and explain like Greek," and imagine it's like Greece 3000

[01:23:28] years ago. "Explain why you said an unexamined life is not worth living." And then it will

[01:23:36] manage to switch its context to tell you that based on the data it's been given.

[01:23:40] Now, I asked, there's a thing called the God prompt, which is basically a cycle. It's called

[01:23:48] the God prompt. This will be up on TikTok. But it's a couple of questions you ask chat GPT

[01:23:54] based on all the interactions you've had where it tells you what your problem is.

[01:24:01] Okay. And it says like you have a fear of this and you have this and then you're doing this all

[01:24:09] the time. These things you do well. And I did this and the answer is I haven't told it everything.

[01:24:16] Did it show you a picture of a gun? No, no. It said one of the things that I have a fear

[01:24:26] of irrelevant. And that certainly resonates because I was like building up to doing something.

[01:24:35] And then I ended up with kids and I was very frustrated for 10 years because I was like

[01:24:42] figuring out some path. Probably I was not going anywhere. Were you married at 10 years?

[01:24:51] I was never married to kids, but we were together like a married couple. But I was very frustrated

[01:24:59] for the beginning because I was like, I've got this talent, I've got ability and I want to make

[01:25:06] something and now I've got to look up to kids. So chat GPT got this. Mostly I've been using it

[01:25:15] to help me write the text description for a comedy show I'm promoting or I use it to work a lot.

[01:25:22] But based on my language patterns, based on the type of questions I'm asking it, it's able

[01:25:30] to come up with a pretty, like there's like a hundred hours of therapy I just saved by doing

[01:25:37] this. Interesting. And probably if we ask chat GPT the right questions about you, because they've

[01:25:43] definitely fed it all the podcasts they could find. I think his name is William Goldman. I like

[01:25:50] to talk to him a lot. He won one or two Oscars. He famously wrote Princess Bride. He wrote that

[01:25:56] script. I think he had two Oscars. Oh my God. I apologize. Listen, I feel stupid. He won one for

[01:26:09] political thriller, maybe something related to Watergate. I'm blanking. I haven't slept that much.

[01:26:16] But anyway, he won two Oscars. He won one or two of them, but he famously say no one knows anything.

[01:26:21] In other words, you know, when he was at the peak of his career, they're making between three to

[01:26:28] maybe 500 movies in Hollywood and a lot of them don't do well. Well, obviously they made thinking

[01:26:33] that they were going to be good. It's a lot of time when you do something, even successful one,

[01:26:38] they didn't realize it's going to be that successful because you're just not sure about

[01:26:43] anything that, you know, people just pretend like they know what they're doing, you know?

[01:26:47] So I have friends who are paralyzed by therapy. They do a lot. I've never done it. And I just know

[01:26:55] that my personality and plus growing up in Japan, unlike South Korea, I know a lot of my Korean

[01:27:03] friends do therapy and things like that, but Segun Foro and Carl Yoon and people like that

[01:27:09] never penetrated Japanese mind, you know? It's not a big place to do that because

[01:27:14] reveal yourself and talk about yourself, they're not going to do that, you know? That whole notion

[01:27:19] is very, very strange. Okay, I've got it. Would you be down to do this as a little

[01:27:25] experiment? Well, first of all, has it actually been recording? Yeah, we've got an hour and a

[01:27:36] half already. Oh, wow. So it would have been funny if there's this whole time we were talking,

[01:27:41] we didn't record it. Well, we got audio, we got that, that's the second audio track. But

[01:27:47] with semi-pro here with kind of shitty podcasters. No, all right, this could be an interesting thing

[01:27:54] for us to do in a later podcast. Well, maybe interesting for you. But I'd be also interested

[01:28:02] to see, I mean, you could look at the results first without me. And if you want to talk about it,

[01:28:10] or if you want to share that, because I think you might be surprised. Like if we took the transcript

[01:28:16] of what we've been talking about. Sure. I am curious now. So you take the transcript

[01:28:24] and then you ask, like, what's the problem with Yoshi, he'll give you. Well, just the way people

[01:28:30] construct language. Yeah. So if you look at the pauses, I mean, we know this is comedians, we play

[01:28:36] with language a lot. But you can follow someone's train of thought. Sure. And, you know, you see

[01:28:42] different comedians, it's like the ADHD comedian, who the moment there's a distraction, he has a

[01:28:48] funny reaction. It's hilarious. And it's like, I'm curious about that, too. It's also things like,

[01:28:54] like, you know, who was talking about that is Steve Martin. He has philosophy degree, almost

[01:29:03] graduated from philosophy degree from Long Beach State. His favorite philosopher was, maybe I'm not

[01:29:09] saying his name right, but Ludwig Wittgenstein. Oh, he's the crazy philosopher. Yeah. Because one

[01:29:15] time he asked Bertrand Russell, another famous British, a famous British philosopher. He said,

[01:29:21] he asked Russell, like, should I become a philosopher? And then he asked Ludwig to write

[01:29:25] him something. And I think he read like a first sentence or something. Yeah, you need to be a

[01:29:29] philosopher. And there was a story about Ludwig supposed to climb up a tree and stay on top of

[01:29:35] that tree for a while or something. But he's famous for like that thing, like language game, right?

[01:29:39] And it's very mathematical. I tried to read it. I have no idea what he's saying. But he's just so

[01:29:45] beyond me, you know. So here's another theory I got is that different people have different ways

[01:29:53] of thinking. So I think mostly when you have like abstract, the question, the way you can understand

[01:30:01] the way someone's brains work is you ask them an abstract question where they have to think about

[01:30:05] it. Oh, it doesn't work. And for me, I'm a visual thinker. So you asked me an abstract question.

[01:30:11] What I'm going to do is my eyes will probably go to the left. I make some kind of picture in my head.

[01:30:18] Right. And then I come back and interpret that picture with logic and words and whatever. You

[01:30:24] have, I remember listening to Kanye on the Joe Rogan podcast. He was, what a fascinating guy.

[01:30:31] Yeah. And he sounds like a madman until in that podcast about two hours in,

[01:30:38] the whole thing that he'd been talking about suddenly started to make sense.

[01:30:43] Sure. And he's like a three or four dimensional thinker. He's got some hypercube.

[01:30:49] Yeah. He's putting all this stuff and to try and explain it in an A equals B equals C manner,

[01:30:58] which is linear, makes no sense to people. If somebody asked me like five to seven,

[01:31:04] I don't know, influential word is right, impactful person. But let's say I have to pick like five,

[01:31:11] maybe 10 influential people last 10 years. I could have met them but I never met them.

[01:31:16] If I have to make a 10 people on that list, easily him, Trump, Elon Musk is there because they're

[01:31:25] doing, I'm not saying what they're doing is right. It's just that they think different and they behave

[01:31:30] differently and they're very, very interesting. Weirdly, Lausanne lady, she hated Elon Musk.

[01:31:40] Is this a lady that you knew?

[01:31:42] It's the one that I was talking about before I met you.

[01:31:48] Yeah.

[01:31:48] I think one thing-

[01:31:50] That's the area in Switzerland, right?

[01:31:52] I've got to, I mean, I will just edit this. I think she got sex trafficked

[01:31:57] by her dad who was high up at Swiss bank and he used to take her on business trips.

[01:32:03] There's a possibility she even, I see a possibility where she may have got abused by Elon Musk

[01:32:13] as a kid. And so she had an ability to read people that was uncanny

[01:32:22] and she did not like, she had this reaction to Elon Musk of like, he's an evil motherfucker.

[01:32:28] And Elon Musk is definitely has got multiple personalities.

[01:32:33] To me, the most revealing thing with Elon Musk was when he was seeing his mom on SNL.

[01:32:40] And if you don't get a creepy vibe off his mom, then you're in a weird,

[01:32:47] did you remember that? Did you see that?

[01:32:49] Yeah. Can you keep talking?

[01:32:52] Let's take a break. I've got to piss.

[01:32:53] I've got to piss too.

[01:32:54] Yeah. Okay. You go first. I'll stop and we can resume.

[01:32:58] And I could use a coffee chip all the time. How long have you been doing this? Is it work?
