[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  I mean, you remember there's that dude, he was big on, there's a documentary about him

[<a id="00-00-08">00:00:08</a>]  who shot himself under the chin, blew his face off and survived.

[<a id="00-00-13">00:00:13</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-00-14">00:00:14</a>]  That's like, that sucks.

[<a id="00-00-18">00:00:18</a>]  To me, to me, like, I mean, this is duck, but the way Kurt Cobain did it, the way he's

[<a id="00-00-29">00:00:29</a>]  supposed to do it apparently is you fill like a shotgun with water in the barrels.

[<a id="00-00-35">00:00:35</a>]  So when you fire, there's like, you just obliterate.

[<a id="00-00-39">00:00:39</a>]  So you fill the, there is also, are you already recording this?

[<a id="00-00-45">00:00:45</a>]  There is also the thing where you should take water in your mouth, especially when you use

[<a id="00-00-50">00:00:50</a>]  a single bullet because the pressure blows your head off.

[<a id="00-00-55">00:00:55</a>]  You guys missed a bunch of interesting things we were just talking like first three, four,

[<a id="00-01-03">00:01:03</a>]  five minutes.

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  I mean, that would be a good class for eighth graders.

[<a id="00-01-09">00:01:09</a>]  We don't want you to kill yourself, but if you're going to do it, do it right.

[<a id="00-01-15">00:01:15</a>]  We were talking about my cousin and we were talking about the time when I tried to shoot

[<a id="00-01-19">00:01:19</a>]  that, a guy trying to rob us, it's like 80, 1980, 80, 80 or 81, I can't remember, but.

[<a id="00-01-29">00:01:29</a>]  Were you in LA?

[<a id="00-01-31">00:01:31</a>]  No, this is Bromwich in Washington.

[<a id="00-01-32">00:01:32</a>]  We had a place called Handy Corner grocery store, 11th street, Bromwich in Washington,

[<a id="00-01-38">00:01:38</a>]  which is Navy town.

[<a id="00-01-40">00:01:40</a>]  They are the people I lived with first when I was, I don't know, technically kidnapped.

[<a id="00-01-47">00:01:47</a>]  My mom kidnapped us and dropped us off in states, and this is the second time she just

[<a id="00-01-52">00:01:52</a>]  took myself and my younger brother.

[<a id="00-01-55">00:01:55</a>]  And I think it took my dad a month before he figured out that we were completely out

[<a id="00-01-58">00:01:58</a>]  of the country, you know, just like this is another story, just like it took my stepmother's

[<a id="00-02-05">00:02:05</a>]  family that after I beat the shit out of her at my dad's funeral, they didn't realize I

[<a id="00-02-09">00:02:09</a>]  was out of the country like about three weeks or one month later because they were looking

[<a id="00-02-14">00:02:14</a>]  for me, you know, thinking I was in Japan or something.

[<a id="00-02-18">00:02:18</a>]  Soon as I kicked the shit out of her, I went straight to the airport, you know, so I know

[<a id="00-02-21">00:02:21</a>]  the whole procedure when you assault somebody, just leave, you know.

[<a id="00-02-25">00:02:25</a>]  Believe me, that wasn't like the first time either.

[<a id="00-02-29">00:02:29</a>]  I've done that kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-02-30">00:02:30</a>]  Hang on, what now?

[<a id="00-02-31">00:02:31</a>]  It's like a Pearl Harbor attack, you know.

[<a id="00-02-35">00:02:35</a>]  But you struck multiple times, what are you saying, like, so you attacked your aunt?

[<a id="00-02-40">00:02:40</a>]  No, no, no, no, two different things.

[<a id="00-02-43">00:02:43</a>]  So the first time was tonight when I was 10 or 11, you know, my mother kidnapped us.

[<a id="00-02-48">00:02:48</a>]  We were living with my mother's second oldest sister and she was with her boyfriend, John.

[<a id="00-02-58">00:02:58</a>]  We called him uncle even though they're not married or anything and quickly I was working

[<a id="00-03-05">00:03:05</a>]  at the store because even though language was a problem, I could do math so I did fast

[<a id="00-03-11">00:03:11</a>]  calculation, change and stuff, you know.

[<a id="00-03-14">00:03:14</a>]  So he would just like scan all the stuff and a guy walked in one time, I think he was trying

[<a id="00-03-20">00:03:20</a>]  to buy something small, put $5 on the counter.

[<a id="00-03-25">00:03:25</a>]  So I did it, the tally and I was ready to get change and I think my uncle was trying

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  to put it back.

[<a id="00-03-33">00:03:33</a>]  All of a sudden, he punched my uncle in the face, reached over and tried to grab cash

[<a id="00-03-36">00:03:36</a>]  out of the registry, you know.

[<a id="00-03-38">00:03:38</a>]  And you're 10 at this point?

[<a id="00-03-40">00:03:40</a>]  10 or 11.

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  And then, I mean I didn't even hesitate, I grabbed the gun and tried to shoot the guy.

[<a id="00-03-48">00:03:48</a>]  Of course I missed and it was so close, it was just kind of embarrassing, like I'm anti

[<a id="00-03-53">00:03:53</a>]  John Wick, you know, like I can't even hit.

[<a id="00-03-58">00:03:58</a>]  So my uncle was bleeding and because of the recoil, I hit myself in the face.

[<a id="00-04-04">00:04:04</a>]  The guy is scared, he loses $5 and it was just like US politics, you just miss, there's

[<a id="00-04-12">00:04:12</a>]  no winner.

[<a id="00-04-13">00:04:13</a>]  So he just ran.

[<a id="00-04-15">00:04:15</a>]  He just ran but the reason I'm telling this story is because you thought it was funny,

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  my aunt was mad because she missed the guy, you see how crazy that is?

[<a id="00-04-23">00:04:23</a>]  Like most adults would say thank god you didn't kill the man, she doesn't give a fuck.

[<a id="00-04-29">00:04:29</a>]  She basically said what are you fucking faggot, you can't even shoot the guy in the face.

[<a id="00-04-36">00:04:36</a>]  And she points her hand going back and forth, this is how you do it, alright?

[<a id="00-04-40">00:04:40</a>]  Take that black guy, take that white guy, black guy, Mexican, no no black guy, black

[<a id="00-04-44">00:04:44</a>]  guy, Mexican.

[<a id="00-04-45">00:04:45</a>]  I don't know why she keeps saying blacks and Mexicans, even though it was a white guy who

[<a id="00-04-49">00:04:49</a>]  punched my uncle and there's no Mexican in that area, maybe some blacks.

[<a id="00-04-53">00:04:53</a>]  But six years later when she had a bar down in LA and she got robbed by a bunch of Mexicans,

[<a id="00-05-01">00:05:01</a>]  she was like see I told you.

[<a id="00-05-02">00:05:02</a>]  Maybe that's payback though for her karma.

[<a id="00-05-05">00:05:05</a>]  But yeah it was like my mother's father was a rich man in Korea and when he passed away

[<a id="00-05-15">00:05:15</a>]  supposedly his younger brother and sister took everything, left my grandmother with

[<a id="00-05-21">00:05:21</a>]  nothing but like four daughters and a son, maybe five, I don't know how many aunts I

[<a id="00-05-26">00:05:26</a>]  have on that side.

[<a id="00-05-28">00:05:28</a>]  So I think they became very desperate and I don't think my aunt was like that because

[<a id="00-05-36">00:05:36</a>]  based on what other people told, but all the failures and trusting people losing money,

[<a id="00-05-40">00:05:40</a>]  I think it kind of turned her into a kind of hard person.

[<a id="00-05-44">00:05:44</a>]  So but at least she tried, you know, and she came in a red hot go, but what you know what's

[<a id="00-05-52">00:05:52</a>]  funny is like out of all the women who raised us, she probably was the best person.

[<a id="00-05-57">00:05:57</a>]  How come?

[<a id="00-05-58">00:05:58</a>]  Because I think she was fair, you know, she makes sure I went to school, make sure I do

[<a id="00-06-01">00:06:01</a>]  my homework.

[<a id="00-06-02">00:06:02</a>]  My mom did none of that shit.

[<a id="00-06-03">00:06:03</a>]  I think she was just depressed the whole time.

[<a id="00-06-06">00:06:06</a>]  She might, I don't know, if I was a young mama joke in there or something, yeah.

[<a id="00-06-12">00:06:12</a>]  I think I think because she was kind of, I'm not saying they put a gun to her head, but

[<a id="00-06-16">00:06:16</a>]  I think she ended up marrying the person she didn't want to marry and difficult family

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  circumstance.

[<a id="00-06-24">00:06:24</a>]  And so she, she just like I was saying, like the show that I did for you Tuesday where

[<a id="00-06-29">00:06:29</a>]  I was being sincere and hoping to get some empathy and saying, well, imagine, you know,

[<a id="00-06-34">00:06:34</a>]  every morning when my mother see my face, it's a reminder of her unhappiness.

[<a id="00-06-39">00:06:39</a>]  I mean, I was expecting a sympathy, the whole fucking room laughed.

[<a id="00-06-42">00:06:42</a>]  I was like, oh, okay, well, I wasn't expecting a laughter at that spot.

[<a id="00-06-46">00:06:46</a>]  So people will surprise you, you know, I think there's something there and I can't, I can't

[<a id="00-06-51">00:06:51</a>]  express it.

[<a id="00-06-52">00:06:52</a>]  There's something Swiss.

[<a id="00-06-53">00:06:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-54">00:06:54</a>]  Because, because if for her, it must be weird looking at the little Asian kid because don't

[<a id="00-06-59">00:06:59</a>]  they all look the same?

[<a id="00-07-00">00:07:00</a>]  Oh, yes.

[<a id="00-07-01">00:07:01</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-07-02">00:07:02</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-07-03">00:07:03</a>]  No, no, I don't mean that.

[<a id="00-07-04">00:07:04</a>]  I mean, it is true, but go ahead.

[<a id="00-07-07">00:07:07</a>]  Sometimes I can't even tell.

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  My mother, mother of my kids used to call, call many switches, like the Swiss Amazons.

[<a id="00-07-18">00:07:18</a>]  And there's like the, the, the mother, the matriarch of Swiss families is something to

[<a id="00-07-24">00:07:24</a>]  be studied because you look at this city, like the men are not men, the men are here

[<a id="00-07-29">00:07:29</a>]  pretty weak in terms of their attitude and it's the, it's the women you watch with the

[<a id="00-07-35">00:07:35</a>]  kids and the whole family who's running the show.

[<a id="00-07-39">00:07:39</a>]  There's something that, and it's, it's, uh, yeah.

[<a id="00-07-43">00:07:43</a>]  And there's also this thing of, um, I don't know, like, like this city's full of people

[<a id="00-07-48">00:07:48</a>]  that have been academic overachievers and there's, there's a role that mothers play

[<a id="00-07-54">00:07:54</a>]  there as well.

[<a id="00-07-55">00:07:55</a>]  So I'm glad, I'm glad you said this because I think I might be a little wrong to think

[<a id="00-08-00">00:08:00</a>]  everyone that lives in Zurich is a representative of the whole country.

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  Because if I go out in farms, I think you have a pretty sturdy, hardy men.

[<a id="00-08-07">00:08:07</a>]  That's a hard, very different, very different people out there, but cities are always like

[<a id="00-08-13">00:08:13</a>]  that.

[<a id="00-08-14">00:08:14</a>]  It doesn't matter where you go.

[<a id="00-08-15">00:08:15</a>]  Hmm.

[<a id="00-08-16">00:08:16</a>]  No, but there's some cities are pretty rough and they're kind of have to be tough like

[<a id="00-08-20">00:08:20</a>]  Detroit.

[<a id="00-08-21">00:08:21</a>]  That's not a, that's not easy, but that's not a city that, that's, that's technically

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  a war zone.

[<a id="00-08-25">00:08:25</a>]  Like ever since.

[<a id="00-08-26">00:08:26</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-08-27">00:08:27</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-08-28">00:08:28</a>]  You're ever since, ever since, ever since GM collapsed because, and this is interesting

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  to me.

[<a id="00-08-34">00:08:34</a>]  These are cities, Detroit is kind of like the role model because it was the biggest

[<a id="00-08-37">00:08:37</a>]  one of those.

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  It's one of those cities that was built around one industry.

[<a id="00-08-42">00:08:42</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-08-43">00:08:43</a>]  And these, it was literally the engine of US economy.

[<a id="00-08-46">00:08:46</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-08-47">00:08:47</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-48">00:08:48</a>]  But it was, it was a Ford and GM.

[<a id="00-08-49">00:08:49</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-50">00:08:50</a>]  That was all out.

[<a id="00-08-51">00:08:51</a>]  Chrysler.

[<a id="00-08-52">00:08:52</a>]  Chrysler.

[<a id="00-08-53">00:08:53</a>]  All these brands have then started to collapse into two conglomerates, whatever.

[<a id="00-08-57">00:08:57</a>]  And you have these single purpose towns all over the US.

[<a id="00-09-02">00:09:02</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-03">00:09:03</a>]  They don't really have that here.

[<a id="00-09-04">00:09:04</a>]  What do you mean?

[<a id="00-09-07">00:09:07</a>]  So there is not a single city in Switzerland where I would say like the Detroit of Switzerland,

[<a id="00-09-13">00:09:13</a>]  the Detroit of Switzerland, like the 90% of economic prowess comes from a single industry.

[<a id="00-09-18">00:09:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-19">00:09:19</a>]  That doesn't happen.

[<a id="00-09-20">00:09:20</a>]  What does happen though is, Oh, I see what you're saying.

[<a id="00-09-23">00:09:23</a>]  So what you're saying is like, they don't have city like Detroit where it depends just

[<a id="00-09-25">00:09:25</a>]  one single industry.

[<a id="00-09-27">00:09:27</a>]  That's the one.

[<a id="00-09-28">00:09:28</a>]  And when, when the industry failed, Detroit failed, the city failed.

[<a id="00-09-32">00:09:32</a>]  The city went bankrupt in a heartbeat and actually recovering quite nicely now because

[<a id="00-09-38">00:09:38</a>]  they're figuring out there's other stuff than just cars.

[<a id="00-09-41">00:09:41</a>]  But what I'm trying to say is yes, cities can be rough, especially when there is this

[<a id="00-09-49">00:09:49</a>]  like very singular purpose.

[<a id="00-09-53">00:09:53</a>]  Cities in Switzerland or in Europe in general, I think, attract that they attract two types.

[<a id="00-10-02">00:10:02</a>]  They attract economic powerhouses or slash and political people.

[<a id="00-10-12">00:10:12</a>]  And then the people that actually work are not really in the city.

[<a id="00-10-18">00:10:18</a>]  So a lot of the labor that gets done is outside of the city.

[<a id="00-10-23">00:10:23</a>]  So what you have is an overweight of university.

[<a id="00-10-28">00:10:28</a>]  Some cities seem like their main focus, like cultural capital, right?

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  Kinda.

[<a id="00-10-33">00:10:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-34">00:10:34</a>]  Like Krakow, it's like a beautiful place.

[<a id="00-10-35">00:10:35</a>]  And I don't know if they have any major industry, but it's like a tourist destination, you know?

[<a id="00-10-42">00:10:42</a>]  Krakow is interesting because I think they are a major hub for nearshoring.

[<a id="00-10-47">00:10:47</a>]  What is that?

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  So I've never heard a word like that.

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  What does that mean?

[<a id="00-10-53">00:10:53</a>]  It's basically the back office of the Swiss financial industry.

[<a id="00-10-56">00:10:56</a>]  Say that word again?

[<a id="00-10-57">00:10:57</a>]  Nearshoring.

[<a id="00-10-58">00:10:58</a>]  Oh, because there's offshoring.

[<a id="00-11-01">00:11:01</a>]  There's offshoring and that would be like anything further than Pakistan.

[<a id="00-11-07">00:11:07</a>]  Wow.

[<a id="00-11-08">00:11:08</a>]  And then there is nearshoring, so you keep it in Eastern Europe.

[<a id="00-11-10">00:11:10</a>]  Yeah, a lot of the software development is done in Eastern Europe.

[<a id="00-11-14">00:11:14</a>]  I mean, there's a lot of software development technically happening in Zurich.

[<a id="00-11-21">00:11:21</a>]  And apart from Google, there's, I'm going to say controversial, most software developers

[<a id="00-11-27">00:11:27</a>]  in Zurich now are shit because they're overpaid and they don't want to keep working.

[<a id="00-11-33">00:11:33</a>]  Well, it never makes sense to me because if I want to have a quality programmer and cheap,

[<a id="00-11-39">00:11:39</a>]  I'm sure I could find someplace far away from this expensive place.

[<a id="00-11-44">00:11:44</a>]  I can't say one way or another if they're good or bad here, but...

[<a id="00-11-47">00:11:47</a>]  Well, it's also a feedback loop because there's so much stuff gets sent, so much work gets

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  done in a place like Kiev, or it used to, is that those guys...

[<a id="00-11-55">00:11:55</a>]  Still does, by the way.

[<a id="00-11-56">00:11:56</a>]  ...getting the experience.

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-11-58">00:11:58</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="00-11-59">00:11:59</a>]  That's interesting.

[<a id="00-12-00">00:12:00</a>]  So they, you know, they were getting way off track here, but I was working with, we had

[<a id="00-12-05">00:12:05</a>]  an engineering team in Kiev and the resumes, it was like there's one guy who'd been working

[<a id="00-12-14">00:12:14</a>]  on all the ESPN mobile apps, like they've been working on some of the biggest apps in

[<a id="00-12-19">00:12:19</a>]  the world.

[<a id="00-12-20">00:12:20</a>]  And getting that kind of experience as a developer is like, you get your qualification, but then

[<a id="00-12-25">00:12:25</a>]  the next level is actually working on real apps and solving real problems.

[<a id="00-12-31">00:12:31</a>]  And no one's, apart from, there's still some Googlers here, apart from the Googlers, no

[<a id="00-12-36">00:12:36</a>]  one's really getting that kind of experience here anymore.

[<a id="00-12-40">00:12:40</a>]  There's a managerial class here now that basically...

[<a id="00-12-44">00:12:44</a>]  We're going to go back, whatever you want to talk about, but just, just kind of curious

[<a id="00-12-47">00:12:47</a>]  because you kind of have a really connection with the things that have been, during the

[<a id="00-12-51">00:12:51</a>]  last four or five years heavily, but if you had to pick like top five countries with like

[<a id="00-12-57">00:12:57</a>]  great programmers, if you have to rank one through five, if you have to take rough estimate,

[<a id="00-13-01">00:13:01</a>]  how would you rank them?

[<a id="00-13-02">00:13:02</a>]  It depends on the, it depends on the skill set, I reckon.

[<a id="00-13-07">00:13:07</a>]  I think, yeah, I mean, in general...

[<a id="00-13-12">00:13:12</a>]  Yeah, general.

[<a id="00-13-13">00:13:13</a>]  Don't worry about commentaries that you're fucking wrong.

[<a id="00-13-16">00:13:16</a>]  Just if you have to think right now, just without doing any research.

[<a id="00-13-20">00:13:20</a>]  I mean, I mean, for what I've dealt with Belgrade, Serbia, Romania, Timisoara in particular,

[<a id="00-13-30">00:13:30</a>]  and Kiev, and the reason, and probably there'll be more in Russia, because they have, maths

[<a id="00-13-37">00:13:37</a>]  was always a high level to them.

[<a id="00-13-39">00:13:39</a>]  So all the people that did maths at university, the maths universities basically flipped to

[<a id="00-13-45">00:13:45</a>]  teaching software development and, but it's a mix of that plus their work ethic, because

[<a id="00-13-53">00:13:53</a>]  these guys, they're not, they're not trying to have a work life balance, but also they're

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  still, they're still like relatable enough to me, culturally that I can work with them.

[<a id="00-14-06">00:14:06</a>]  Ah, okay, and does Israel rank anywhere in there up there?

[<a id="00-14-11">00:14:11</a>]  Are they pretty decent or...

[<a id="00-14-12">00:14:12</a>]  Yeah, but not for outsourcing.

[<a id="00-14-14">00:14:14</a>]  They don't, yeah.

[<a id="00-14-15">00:14:15</a>]  They have their...

[<a id="00-14-16">00:14:16</a>]  Wow, this is so obvious even to you.

[<a id="00-14-18">00:14:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  I would have listed the exact same countries.

[<a id="00-14-22">00:14:22</a>]  I would have made one parenthesis that it's not just Serbia, it's a large chunk of ex

[<a id="00-14-28">00:14:28</a>]  Yugoslavia.

[<a id="00-14-29">00:14:29</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-14-30">00:14:30</a>]  Where you would find...

[<a id="00-14-31">00:14:31</a>]  Interesting.

[<a id="00-14-32">00:14:32</a>]  Incredibly well-trained and very accomplished developers.

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  And you have Barcelona where there are good developers, but these guys, they have so much

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  opportunity.

[<a id="00-14-41">00:14:41</a>]  That's lifestyle choice though.

[<a id="00-14-42">00:14:42</a>]  They have what?

[<a id="00-14-43">00:14:43</a>]  They have so much opportunity.

[<a id="00-14-44">00:14:44</a>]  Most of them, they won't stay at a company for more than a year.

[<a id="00-14-49">00:14:49</a>]  And yeah, I mean, Israel is kind of like a, it was getting up there with Silicon Valley

[<a id="00-14-58">00:14:58</a>]  for developing, for innovation basically, for like...

[<a id="00-15-02">00:15:02</a>]  I say that because when I went to Glenn Maxwell's case, her sisters, Christine, I can't remember

[<a id="00-15-08">00:15:08</a>]  the other one now, but they have a heavily connection with the telecommunication program

[<a id="00-15-15">00:15:15</a>]  in Israel because my friend Tom, Tom Wolf, he was working in one of the start-up of Silicon

[<a id="00-15-22">00:15:22</a>]  Valley in '94, '95, '96, and he used to tell me, see Christine and other fraternity, another

[<a id="00-15-30">00:15:30</a>]  sister, same age, running around.

[<a id="00-15-33">00:15:33</a>]  And every once in a while, they would bring Glenn Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein to the office,

[<a id="00-15-36">00:15:36</a>]  so he remembers seeing them.

[<a id="00-15-38">00:15:38</a>]  And there's all this community question, like Robert Maxwell might have been intelligent

[<a id="00-15-43">00:15:43</a>]  agency friendly or had something to do with during World War II.

[<a id="00-15-47">00:15:47</a>]  And their sister had Magellan, the search engine, something Magellan, she was one of

[<a id="00-15-56">00:15:56</a>]  the founders for that.

[<a id="00-15-57">00:15:57</a>]  So once this company went bankrupt, they both went back to Israel, you know.

[<a id="00-16-02">00:16:02</a>]  And it's interesting that, I'm not surprised you didn't mention Asian country for programming.

[<a id="00-16-08">00:16:08</a>]  You kind of answered my question because Asians are really good math and whatever, but when

[<a id="00-16-13">00:16:13</a>]  it comes to like creative type and thinking something original, I think it's kind of hard

[<a id="00-16-19">00:16:19</a>]  for Asians like, they're staying outside of the box, you know what I'm trying to say?

[<a id="00-16-24">00:16:24</a>]  There's two types of programming, though.

[<a id="00-16-28">00:16:28</a>]  What Harry, I'm not putting words in your mouth, but I think what you were saying there

[<a id="00-16-35">00:16:35</a>]  is you have very well educated developers that can do the task that you give them to

[<a id="00-16-43">00:16:43</a>]  do.

[<a id="00-16-44">00:16:44</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-16-45">00:16:45</a>]  The experience when you go far east, and this is not, because it is not an educational issue,

[<a id="00-16-50">00:16:50</a>]  I think it's a cultural issue.

[<a id="00-16-52">00:16:52</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-16-53">00:16:53</a>]  The work package needs to be way more defined of what you want to receive.

[<a id="00-16-58">00:16:58</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-16-59">00:16:59</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-17-00">00:17:00</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-17-01">00:17:01</a>]  Like for example, there's some people I worked with before and they would just say yes to

[<a id="00-17-06">00:17:06</a>]  everything.

[<a id="00-17-07">00:17:07</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-17-08">00:17:08</a>]  There's that.

[<a id="00-17-09">00:17:09</a>]  And so, and I haven't had experience working with like development teams in China, I'm

[<a id="00-17-15">00:17:15</a>]  sure it can be done.

[<a id="00-17-16">00:17:16</a>]  Actually, but just to go back to, you said something that I get excited about.

[<a id="00-17-21">00:17:21</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-17-22">00:17:22</a>]  The...

[<a id="00-17-23">00:17:23</a>]  Child abuse?

[<a id="00-17-24">00:17:24</a>]  No, the Maxwell siblings.

[<a id="00-17-27">00:17:27</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-17-28">00:17:28</a>]  And it just amazes me that as a global civilization, one sister does that and nobody bothers to

[<a id="00-17-39">00:17:39</a>]  look at what the rest of these fuckers are doing.

[<a id="00-17-42">00:17:42</a>]  Like they're all, and if you look, there's some Wikipedia.

[<a id="00-17-45">00:17:45</a>]  So you've got this fucking dad who got tossed off a boat and his connections go into these

[<a id="00-17-51">00:17:51</a>]  like royal pedophile networks and some evil shit was happening.

[<a id="00-17-55">00:17:55</a>]  Can I give you my really weird theory on that?

[<a id="00-18-00">00:18:00</a>]  Go.

[<a id="00-18-01">00:18:01</a>]  Here we go.

[<a id="00-18-02">00:18:02</a>]  They want you to focus on child molestation or teenage molestation and sex assault because

[<a id="00-18-11">00:18:11</a>]  they don't want you to think about which is a bigger crime, which is the financial crimes.

[<a id="00-18-14">00:18:14</a>]  Yeah, exactly.

[<a id="00-18-15">00:18:15</a>]  It's a misdirection, I think.

[<a id="00-18-16">00:18:16</a>]  But that's what I mean if you look at what the other sisters are doing.

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  Interesting was that taking advantage of teenage girls is not the only thing he did.

[<a id="00-18-25">00:18:25</a>]  I don't know if you know this.

[<a id="00-18-26">00:18:26</a>]  There's that financial stuff.

[<a id="00-18-28">00:18:28</a>]  And let me tell you, when you rip off super rich people, they're too embarrassed to publicly

[<a id="00-18-32">00:18:32</a>]  announce they got duped.

[<a id="00-18-34">00:18:34</a>]  So they just kind of keep their mouth shut.

[<a id="00-18-35">00:18:35</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-36">00:18:36</a>]  Except if they're super in line, like I remember when DiCaprio was caught because he was one

[<a id="00-18-42">00:18:42</a>]  of the Madoff victims.

[<a id="00-18-44">00:18:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-45">00:18:45</a>]  And there's also like this one fat, I don't know, the Singaporean guy was tricked everybody

[<a id="00-18-50">00:18:50</a>]  in Hollywood to give him money.

[<a id="00-18-51">00:18:51</a>]  Oh, yes.

[<a id="00-18-52">00:18:52</a>]  He took money from Singaporean government and things like that.

[<a id="00-18-55">00:18:55</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-18-56">00:18:56</a>]  It'd be interesting.

[<a id="00-18-57">00:18:57</a>]  We're going to get into it some other time to actually, maybe we should just go through

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  them.

[<a id="00-19-02">00:19:02</a>]  Let's look at each of the Maxwell siblings because they're all working in digital spying

[<a id="00-19-10">00:19:10</a>]  and stuff like that.

[<a id="00-19-11">00:19:11</a>]  Hold on to that thought, but we'll jump in the list in 40 seconds.

[<a id="00-19-16">00:19:16</a>]  But the reason I was going to say that because this programming thing have a connection with

[<a id="00-19-19">00:19:19</a>]  a set of comedy, I'll talk about it later.

[<a id="00-19-25">00:19:25</a>]  It's my true sense.

[<a id="00-19-26">00:19:26</a>]  Go with the programming sense.

[<a id="00-19-28">00:19:28</a>]  No, I mean, we can go.

[<a id="00-19-30">00:19:30</a>]  No, no, but say what you want because I forget sometimes what I want to talk about.

[<a id="00-19-34">00:19:34</a>]  Like I haven't looked deep into them, but immediately from their job titles, it's like

[<a id="00-19-38">00:19:38</a>]  one of them is doing, I don't know, data analytics for the Israeli military.

[<a id="00-19-45">00:19:45</a>]  I mean, it's written all over them and these are not good people.

[<a id="00-19-54">00:19:54</a>]  I remember it's Christine, Isabel, Maxwell.

[<a id="00-19-56">00:19:56</a>]  That's what it is.

[<a id="00-19-57">00:19:57</a>]  And there's more.

[<a id="00-19-58">00:19:58</a>]  There's a brother, I think, works in pharma.

[<a id="00-20-00">00:20:00</a>]  I looked into it one time.

[<a id="00-20-02">00:20:02</a>]  There are two brothers.

[<a id="00-20-03">00:20:03</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-04">00:20:04</a>]  Also, we're talking, we're getting off track, but you're talking about the series Mad Men

[<a id="00-20-10">00:20:10</a>]  about the Madison Avenue, which was the original propaganda, which became marketing.

[<a id="00-20-16">00:20:16</a>]  Edward Bernays, we've talked about.

[<a id="00-20-18">00:20:18</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-19">00:20:19</a>]  segment Freud's nephew.

[<a id="00-20-20">00:20:20</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  It's on his wife's side.

[<a id="00-20-23">00:20:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-24">00:20:24</a>]  And Bernays' grand nephew or grandson is number two or number three on Netflix.

[<a id="00-20-30">00:20:30</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  And then on the other side, you got this dude, Clement Freud, who was a journalist and in

[<a id="00-20-35">00:20:35</a>]  the BBC.

[<a id="00-20-36">00:20:36</a>]  And I'm pretty sure there's a link between him and Maxwell, Robert Maxwell, but yeah.

[<a id="00-20-43">00:20:43</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-20-45">00:20:45</a>]  Programming and comedy.

[<a id="00-20-46">00:20:46</a>]  No, no.

[<a id="00-20-47">00:20:47</a>]  I think sometimes I see comedians, they just, they don't care about state of comedy or laughter

[<a id="00-20-52">00:20:52</a>]  in general, but they saw opportunity, but they just watch a bunch of different comedians.

[<a id="00-20-56">00:20:56</a>]  Like they will see common theme, what you need to get laughter.

[<a id="00-20-59">00:20:59</a>]  So they're like, they're doing just task.

[<a id="00-21-01">00:21:01</a>]  They don't necessarily have a feeling.

[<a id="00-21-03">00:21:03</a>]  Like, as in they're analyzing it from a purely theoretical way.

[<a id="00-21-10">00:21:10</a>]  Like almost like a technical skills.

[<a id="00-21-11">00:21:11</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  But they don't care about laughter or comedy in general.

[<a id="00-21-14">00:21:14</a>]  They see opportunity.

[<a id="00-21-16">00:21:16</a>]  And where somebody like Louis CK, he's doing that shit at the highest level, you know, it's

[<a id="00-21-22">00:21:22</a>]  just, it's almost like a chess player, like Magnus Carlsen or something.

[<a id="00-21-28">00:21:28</a>]  He said like, it's really weird cause you know, he studied so much, but a lot of them,

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  he had this feeling for the game, you know?

[<a id="00-21-35">00:21:35</a>]  And I think Louis have that feeling for the comedy.

[<a id="00-21-39">00:21:39</a>]  But I see a lot of young kids, they're really well at TikTok.

[<a id="00-21-42">00:21:42</a>]  They just know like, sometimes it's like a hacky joke, but they know exactly like, okay,

[<a id="00-21-46">00:21:46</a>]  I noticed this is how I get this many views.

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  So they follow that.

[<a id="00-21-50">00:21:50</a>]  So it's about programming.

[<a id="00-21-52">00:21:52</a>]  So it's about painting my numbers kind of.

[<a id="00-21-56">00:21:56</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-57">00:21:57</a>]  They don't, they don't care what they're doing and they just know, okay, I'm smart enough.

[<a id="00-22-02">00:22:02</a>]  I notice a pattern.

[<a id="00-22-03">00:22:03</a>]  I'm just going to copy the same pattern.

[<a id="00-22-05">00:22:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-22-06">00:22:06</a>]  I always had to hope that comedy was better than that though, because like it's self cleansing

[<a id="00-22-09">00:22:09</a>]  in a way.

[<a id="00-22-10">00:22:10</a>]  If you're, if you haven't lived in LA, then you don't want to say how soulless it is.

[<a id="00-22-14">00:22:14</a>]  But hang on.

[<a id="00-22-16">00:22:16</a>]  The good guys, sorry, not in the sense, not in the sense of being good people, but in

[<a id="00-22-23">00:22:23</a>]  the sense of being good comedians, the good comedians prevail.

[<a id="00-22-28">00:22:28</a>]  Because this is, didn't you even hear Patrice, there's one of Patrice's last Opie and Antony

[<a id="00-22-35">00:22:35</a>]  appearances where he's saying, I'm stupid because I always thought I had to just be

[<a id="00-22-40">00:22:40</a>]  the best performer that I can become.

[<a id="00-22-43">00:22:43</a>]  And he is stupid.

[<a id="00-22-44">00:22:44</a>]  And they're all like, you really are an idiot for doing that, because he even told, if you

[<a id="00-22-49">00:22:49</a>]  want to be, yeah, go ahead.

[<a id="00-22-52">00:22:52</a>]  He even told his manager, Jonathan, well, maybe, okay, I'll just say Jonathan, he told

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  his manager a little before he passed away, because he didn't know he was going to die,

[<a id="00-23-00">00:23:00</a>]  you know, just like we didn't know we were going to have World War Two, three.

[<a id="00-23-04">00:23:04</a>]  But he just said like, I don't know why I was so funny and so hard, you know, I should

[<a id="00-23-09">00:23:09</a>]  have just kind of worked with him, you know.

[<a id="00-23-13">00:23:13</a>]  But that's the sad thing.

[<a id="00-23-14">00:23:14</a>]  By the time you realize that maybe you were a little inflexible and should have changed

[<a id="00-23-18">00:23:18</a>]  his way.

[<a id="00-23-19">00:23:19</a>]  It's like Steve Jobs.

[<a id="00-23-20">00:23:20</a>]  He could survive if he did the proper treatment, but aesthetically he didn't want to have a

[<a id="00-23-27">00:23:27</a>]  scar or something.

[<a id="00-23-28">00:23:28</a>]  By the time he realized it was too late.

[<a id="00-23-30">00:23:30</a>]  I want to know what you guys are saying, because I feel like I'm adults here.

[<a id="00-23-37">00:23:37</a>]  Why are you so cynical about this?

[<a id="00-23-38">00:23:38</a>]  I don't think it's cynical.

[<a id="00-23-40">00:23:40</a>]  I think this is just reality it is now, you know.

[<a id="00-23-44">00:23:44</a>]  I think it's been like that.

[<a id="00-23-46">00:23:46</a>]  Am I idealizing what comedy is?

[<a id="00-23-48">00:23:48</a>]  No, no, no, look, it's like that picture.

[<a id="00-23-51">00:23:51</a>]  Like what do you see?

[<a id="00-23-52">00:23:52</a>]  You see an old lady or a young girl?

[<a id="00-23-54">00:23:54</a>]  You see a young girl and he and I, we see all women because that's what we were into.

[<a id="00-23-59">00:23:59</a>]  All women.

[<a id="00-24-00">00:24:00</a>]  All ugly women.

[<a id="00-24-01">00:24:01</a>]  So you're not wrong.

[<a id="00-24-04">00:24:04</a>]  You're looking at the same thing, you know.

[<a id="00-24-06">00:24:06</a>]  I'm looking at exactly the same thing.

[<a id="00-24-08">00:24:08</a>]  You're a good person.

[<a id="00-24-09">00:24:09</a>]  You're younger than us.

[<a id="00-24-11">00:24:11</a>]  I'm not a good person.

[<a id="00-24-13">00:24:13</a>]  You work really, really hard.

[<a id="00-24-15">00:24:15</a>]  But okay, so here's my thought, here's my thought.

[<a id="00-24-19">00:24:19</a>]  Because this is zero people in general in art.

[<a id="00-24-22">00:24:22</a>]  Like it doesn't work the same way in business.

[<a id="00-24-24">00:24:24</a>]  In business the guy that's doing painting by numbers usually gets to semi-executive

[<a id="00-24-30">00:24:30</a>]  level.

[<a id="00-24-31">00:24:31</a>]  Like that's the guy that runs departments but not entire companies.

[<a id="00-24-35">00:24:35</a>]  The guy that runs companies, he's the psychopath.

[<a id="00-24-38">00:24:38</a>]  He goes a step further.

[<a id="00-24-40">00:24:40</a>]  So all the analytics are done.

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  In comedy that kind of doesn't work.

[<a id="00-24-44">00:24:44</a>]  Because you don't ever run things.

[<a id="00-24-48">00:24:48</a>]  Especially if you're on stage.

[<a id="00-24-49">00:24:49</a>]  The fuckwits agents if they are, and thank fuck we don't really have them here, they

[<a id="00-24-56">00:24:56</a>]  are the business facing thing.

[<a id="00-24-59">00:24:59</a>]  But the comedians, they always face the same problem every night, every night, every night.

[<a id="00-25-06">00:25:06</a>]  And the guy that's doing painting by numbers, he's the boring cunt because that's the guy

[<a id="00-25-11">00:25:11</a>]  that gets hacky.

[<a id="00-25-12">00:25:12</a>]  Am I wrong?

[<a id="00-25-13">00:25:13</a>]  Yeah, but number one hacky is only a comedians judgment.

[<a id="00-25-18">00:25:18</a>]  I mean I've heard little hints.

[<a id="00-25-20">00:25:20</a>]  People say I'm hacky but like behind back some bigger names are hacky but those lesser

[<a id="00-25-24">00:25:24</a>]  par will never say that to them.

[<a id="00-25-26">00:25:26</a>]  Yeah and I've heard things like for example Matt Rife, those guys buy audiences to fill

[<a id="00-25-33">00:25:33</a>]  a venue.

[<a id="00-25-34">00:25:34</a>]  They'll fill it with audience they buy so they can get these crowd work videos.

[<a id="00-25-38">00:25:38</a>]  I've never heard that.

[<a id="00-25-40">00:25:40</a>]  And then they've got these awesome crowd work videos blowing up on social media and eventually

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  this thing is self-propelling.

[<a id="00-25-46">00:25:46</a>]  Do you believe that?

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  Yeah, actually yeah.

[<a id="00-25-50">00:25:50</a>]  Because I mean the flip side is, I mean for me personally I don't give a shit.

[<a id="00-25-56">00:25:56</a>]  I know my brain and comedy keeps my brain entertained.

[<a id="00-26-01">00:26:01</a>]  Like I love it.

[<a id="00-26-02">00:26:02</a>]  I keep learning more about this.

[<a id="00-26-04">00:26:04</a>]  And for me I'm just on a mission as much as I can to be undeniably funny.

[<a id="00-26-09">00:26:09</a>]  I don't give a shit about being famous.

[<a id="00-26-11">00:26:11</a>]  I don't want that.

[<a id="00-26-13">00:26:13</a>]  I just like it when there's a live comedy in a room with people and the people are laughing.

[<a id="00-26-18">00:26:18</a>]  Look I'm a little bi because I do like Matt.

[<a id="00-26-21">00:26:21</a>]  I've never hurt anybody by buying tickets but I will say that he's very similar to Taylor

[<a id="00-26-26">00:26:26</a>]  Swift.

[<a id="00-26-27">00:26:27</a>]  He brings so many women in there and they're traditionally not the traditional audience

[<a id="00-26-32">00:26:32</a>]  members.

[<a id="00-26-33">00:26:33</a>]  I mean I don't know maybe I'm stereotyped but it's usually men who want to go see comedy

[<a id="00-26-38">00:26:38</a>]  and they bring their wives or girlfriends in general but he brings a lot of fucking

[<a id="00-26-42">00:26:42</a>]  women in there.

[<a id="00-26-43">00:26:43</a>]  You know what?

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  I mean Jesus Christ.

[<a id="00-26-45">00:26:45</a>]  You know what?

[<a id="00-26-46">00:26:46</a>]  We see the exact opposite over here.

[<a id="00-26-48">00:26:48</a>]  People that buy tickets are mostly women.

[<a id="00-26-50">00:26:50</a>]  Interesting.

[<a id="00-26-51">00:26:51</a>]  Is that right?

[<a id="00-26-52">00:26:52</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-53">00:26:53</a>]  We have a high overweight of women purchasing tickets.

[<a id="00-26-57">00:26:57</a>]  They're not overweight.

[<a id="00-26-59">00:26:59</a>]  They're quite slim.

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  The curve is...

[<a id="00-27-03">00:27:03</a>]  Maybe I'm wrong but isn't it also true that women tend to have to make the first move

[<a id="00-27-10">00:27:10</a>]  here too?

[<a id="00-27-11">00:27:11</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-27-12">00:27:12</a>]  That's not true?

[<a id="00-27-13">00:27:13</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-27-14">00:27:14</a>]  No.

[<a id="00-27-15">00:27:15</a>]  Switzerland doesn't have that.

[<a id="00-27-16">00:27:16</a>]  There's...

[<a id="00-27-17">00:27:17</a>]  Where is that true?

[<a id="00-27-18">00:27:18</a>]  Like Finland?

[<a id="00-27-19">00:27:19</a>]  Some of the Scandinavian countries?

[<a id="00-27-20">00:27:20</a>]  Oh okay.

[<a id="00-27-21">00:27:21</a>]  Never mind.

[<a id="00-27-22">00:27:22</a>]  You're right.

[<a id="00-27-23">00:27:23</a>]  I'm getting the places confused.

[<a id="00-27-24">00:27:24</a>]  But I mean I think to answer your question it's like there's a strategy you can take

[<a id="00-27-28">00:27:28</a>]  to...

[<a id="00-27-29">00:27:29</a>]  It's like I did this, I have got these two ladies doing comedy in Portuguese, Brazilian.

[<a id="00-27-36">00:27:36</a>]  Both of them have blown up on social media.

[<a id="00-27-39">00:27:39</a>]  One of them has done it, she's an anthropologist and she's German in Brazil and she just makes

[<a id="00-27-44">00:27:44</a>]  these observations of funny things about Brazil.

[<a id="00-27-47">00:27:47</a>]  Well I've seen that being funny.

[<a id="00-27-48">00:27:48</a>]  And she does a good job of that and it's just she's basically using the same formula again

[<a id="00-27-52">00:27:52</a>]  and again.

[<a id="00-27-53">00:27:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-27-54">00:27:54</a>]  Got a million followers.

[<a id="00-27-55">00:27:55</a>]  These two come and do a show in Zurich.

[<a id="00-27-58">00:27:58</a>]  They got 60 people.

[<a id="00-27-59">00:27:59</a>]  They sold out like the Prime Tower with purely their social media.

[<a id="00-28-03">00:28:03</a>]  And on one hand I was talking to...

[<a id="00-28-05">00:28:05</a>]  Wait, how many people does it hold?

[<a id="00-28-07">00:28:07</a>]  Sixty is about limits.

[<a id="00-28-08">00:28:08</a>]  Sixty is about limits.

[<a id="00-28-09">00:28:09</a>]  Oh okay.

[<a id="00-28-10">00:28:10</a>]  So we'll be there tonight for the show.

[<a id="00-28-13">00:28:13</a>]  And yeah people, what's interesting is that their comedy was okay.

[<a id="00-28-22">00:28:22</a>]  I mean I didn't really understand it all but I could see these weren't like superstar performers.

[<a id="00-28-28">00:28:28</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-28-29">00:28:29</a>]  But people came to see them because they bought into their presence on social media.

[<a id="00-28-32">00:28:32</a>]  And obviously they're fans.

[<a id="00-28-34">00:28:34</a>]  Now this is like a nice story.

[<a id="00-28-36">00:28:36</a>]  The other side of this is you could data science your way into fame and you could data science

[<a id="00-28-43">00:28:43</a>]  your way into blowing up and being successful.

[<a id="00-28-46">00:28:46</a>]  But isn't that just doing your homework?

[<a id="00-28-48">00:28:48</a>]  Sorry for interrupting.

[<a id="00-28-49">00:28:49</a>]  Isn't that just doing your homework?

[<a id="00-28-50">00:28:50</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-28-51">00:28:51</a>]  I mean you could hire someone to do it.

[<a id="00-28-52">00:28:52</a>]  You could just take one of your friends who just finished marketing and say make me famous.

[<a id="00-28-57">00:28:57</a>]  I thought you would go in a different direction because the data science bit is like you go

[<a id="00-29-06">00:29:06</a>]  and listen to your sets and go like all right where did I do well?

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  Why did I do well?

[<a id="00-29-11">00:29:11</a>]  You want to figure that shit out.

[<a id="00-29-12">00:29:12</a>]  And that to me is the more important part.

[<a id="00-29-15">00:29:15</a>]  That's not what I'm talking about.

[<a id="00-29-17">00:29:17</a>]  It's like the technique of getting a 10 second video to get tons of clicks.

[<a id="00-29-23">00:29:23</a>]  Just like this guy Michael Fazzani, he's a friend of ours, he just takes stuff off of

[<a id="00-29-28">00:29:28</a>]  Instagram because you can repost other people's stuff, puts a new headline on it.

[<a id="00-29-33">00:29:33</a>]  And this guy's had videos with like three million views, which is basically someone

[<a id="00-29-38">00:29:38</a>]  else's video, but he just puts a funnier tag on it.

[<a id="00-29-43">00:29:43</a>]  And it's that easy.

[<a id="00-29-44">00:29:44</a>]  It's simply a digital strategy.

[<a id="00-29-48">00:29:48</a>]  But I think it doesn't involve little artistry too because that's what they used to say

[<a id="00-29-51">00:29:51</a>]  if you went Eddie Warhol, he just took a picture of his Campbell suit, kind of repackaged it,

[<a id="00-29-56">00:29:56</a>]  but now it's worth five million dollars.

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  But it's just successive loops that get you good at that.

[<a id="00-30-02">00:30:02</a>]  The same for comedy.

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  I mean to me what I like about comedy in the end the live performance part, it's the best

[<a id="00-30-11">00:30:11</a>]  thing.

[<a id="00-30-12">00:30:12</a>]  Never mind fucking specials and stuff.

[<a id="00-30-14">00:30:14</a>]  But then again it's like, I have huge respect for Mike Carzer who does his stuff.

[<a id="00-30-24">00:30:24</a>]  He does jokes that are very broadly acceptable about buying tickets on the trance or whatever.

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  And they're funny, there's no darkness to it at all.

[<a id="00-30-34">00:30:34</a>]  The people that come out to that, I don't really get this audience.

[<a id="00-30-38">00:30:38</a>]  They just come out for a night and it's some ha ha ha kind of, he gets some good laughs

[<a id="00-30-43">00:30:43</a>]  but then you get people like me on and they can't handle what I'm doing because I'm doing

[<a id="00-30-50">00:30:50</a>]  something more intense.

[<a id="00-30-52">00:30:52</a>]  Is it fair to say to me, I always felt like it's like food, there's no right answer to

[<a id="00-30-57">00:30:57</a>]  what kind of food you should like.

[<a id="00-30-58">00:30:58</a>]  You like what you like.

[<a id="00-31-00">00:31:00</a>]  So comedy is different.

[<a id="00-31-01">00:31:01</a>]  So if you like spicy and salty then you see us or whatever and if you want clever and

[<a id="00-31-06">00:31:06</a>]  smart.

[<a id="00-31-07">00:31:07</a>]  If you like Harry's jokes it's mostly bitter.

[<a id="00-31-10">00:31:10</a>]  Some people don't want meat in it.

[<a id="00-31-14">00:31:14</a>]  I'm not going to say just because you like comedian A and you don't like B, you're someone

[<a id="00-31-18">00:31:18</a>]  like an elitist or like you have no sense.

[<a id="00-31-21">00:31:21</a>]  I'm not saying that, it's a preference, that's all.

[<a id="00-31-25">00:31:25</a>]  That's all that means.

[<a id="00-31-26">00:31:26</a>]  But that's what I'm kind of scared about because when you approach comedy, this is what I find

[<a id="00-31-36">00:31:36</a>]  by your explanation for it.

[<a id="00-31-38">00:31:38</a>]  When comedy is approached, I'm not an expert, I was just kind of giving examples.

[<a id="00-31-41">00:31:41</a>]  None of us are experts, that's why we're having this conversation.

[<a id="00-31-47">00:31:47</a>]  When you're approaching comedy from a purely technical aspect without, and I'm not saying

[<a id="00-31-53">00:31:53</a>]  that I've penetrated the soul of comedy in any shape or form, but if there is no love

[<a id="00-32-00">00:32:00</a>]  for the craft, but it's just as you said, an opportunity.

[<a id="00-32-07">00:32:07</a>]  Did you ever see the movie "Lives of Others"?

[<a id="00-32-10">00:32:10</a>]  You know that movie?

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  It's a German film.

[<a id="00-32-12">00:32:12</a>]  The East German.

[<a id="00-32-13">00:32:13</a>]  Oh yeah.

[<a id="00-32-14">00:32:14</a>]  That rings a bell.

[<a id="00-32-16">00:32:16</a>]  So it's a story.

[<a id="00-32-18">00:32:18</a>]  It's a Stasi guy, right?

[<a id="00-32-20">00:32:20</a>]  Yeah, but his job was to spy on others.

[<a id="00-32-24">00:32:24</a>]  Anyway, I don't know everything, I don't remember everything, but he was told to spy on this

[<a id="00-32-30">00:32:30</a>]  lady because this higher up guy was interested in her, but she has a boyfriend, so he's trying

[<a id="00-32-34">00:32:34</a>]  to get rid of the boyfriend to be with her.

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  So he does it, and the whole time he's spying on him, this couple, he's probably thinking,

[<a id="00-32-45">00:32:45</a>]  what does this have to do with security, it's German or whatever, right?

[<a id="00-32-48">00:32:48</a>]  But he's been told he does the job.

[<a id="00-32-51">00:32:51</a>]  Then later on in the movie, when the fall of Berlin, Cold War's ended, and he sees the

[<a id="00-32-58">00:32:58</a>]  guy who told him to spy on them, right?

[<a id="00-33-00">00:33:00</a>]  Now he's like upper management for some corporate entity, right?

[<a id="00-33-06">00:33:06</a>]  And he's talking to him, and that scene was interesting to me because what that tells

[<a id="00-33-10">00:33:10</a>]  me is that that guy never believed in anything.

[<a id="00-33-13">00:33:13</a>]  He wasn't a communist in a true sense.

[<a id="00-33-15">00:33:15</a>]  No, he was a careerist.

[<a id="00-33-17">00:33:17</a>]  He's one of those people who understand power, how to get it and how to maintain it.

[<a id="00-33-21">00:33:21</a>]  He is one of those guys, he's like Swiss switchblade or whatever, you're all purpose, right?

[<a id="00-33-28">00:33:28</a>]  You use one thing for one particular purpose, you take that one out.

[<a id="00-33-30">00:33:30</a>]  I like the Swiss Army now.

[<a id="00-33-31">00:33:31</a>]  Yeah, so he's very, very flexible.

[<a id="00-33-34">00:33:34</a>]  I met plenty of comedians that are extremely successful, but if you get to know them and

[<a id="00-33-38">00:33:38</a>]  talk to them personally, there's just nothing there, and they're not really funny people.

[<a id="00-33-41">00:33:41</a>]  But they are hard workers, ambitions, and they have a talent to do whatever necessary

[<a id="00-33-47">00:33:47</a>]  to present this thing to the public, and they're really good at it.

[<a id="00-33-50">00:33:50</a>]  So that's why when I say there are people who go to LA, they don't give a fuck about

[<a id="00-33-55">00:33:55</a>]  comedy career track.

[<a id="00-33-58">00:33:58</a>]  Now there's plenty of others who like David Tails of the world, Louis C.K., they love

[<a id="00-34-01">00:34:01</a>]  comedy and Bill Burr and people like that.

[<a id="00-34-03">00:34:03</a>]  There are different people like that.

[<a id="00-34-04">00:34:04</a>]  But these are the guys that become the superstars.

[<a id="00-34-06">00:34:06</a>]  I don't really see one of those hacks become that super famous.

[<a id="00-34-12">00:34:12</a>]  Maybe they make some coin on the way and steal the bread of other comedians.

[<a id="00-34-17">00:34:17</a>]  I don't want to name names, but can I give you another example?

[<a id="00-34-21">00:34:21</a>]  I can give you one example.

[<a id="00-34-23">00:34:23</a>]  There's a whole country called United Kingdom, and that's most of the comedians are exactly

[<a id="00-34-27">00:34:27</a>]  this.

[<a id="00-34-28">00:34:28</a>]  There's a few very good English comedians, and most of it is a selection process.

[<a id="00-34-33">00:34:33</a>]  Starting World War III over here.

[<a id="00-34-37">00:34:37</a>]  All the comedians on TV doing those fucking quiz shows, they're all exactly this.

[<a id="00-34-43">00:34:43</a>]  And they've made it.

[<a id="00-34-44">00:34:44</a>]  They've made it onto the quiz show, they're getting paid good money, they go and hang

[<a id="00-34-47">00:34:47</a>]  out with Simon Cowen at the weekend and do some funny shit.

[<a id="00-34-51">00:34:51</a>]  And they're that, they're just dog shit.

[<a id="00-34-56">00:34:56</a>]  And the reason why there's kind of this connected to the BBC and other things is the system

[<a id="00-35-02">00:35:02</a>]  of gatekeepers.

[<a id="00-35-03">00:35:03</a>]  It's around the universe.

[<a id="00-35-04">00:35:04</a>]  This motherfucking read my mind because what little I saw in Brown, I came like, dude,

[<a id="00-35-09">00:35:09</a>]  I'm only visiting.

[<a id="00-35-10">00:35:10</a>]  I don't give a fuck about the position of scenes.

[<a id="00-35-12">00:35:12</a>]  But they were like, so it's like some dog shit shows and they're very secretive, who

[<a id="00-35-19">00:35:19</a>]  you contact to get spots or yeah, but that's like a little shit.

[<a id="00-35-22">00:35:22</a>]  So if you go London, I'm sure you've been at the biggest scale of people acting like

[<a id="00-35-25">00:35:25</a>]  that.

[<a id="00-35-26">00:35:26</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-35-27">00:35:27</a>]  And they're all, it's all like little hand jobs under the table to get up this ladder.

[<a id="00-35-32">00:35:32</a>]  And it's, and it produces dog shit comedy.

[<a id="00-35-36">00:35:36</a>]  And that's why what's always beautiful about Stuart Lee, when he just goes after comedians

[<a id="00-35-41">00:35:41</a>]  in a funny way and it's become his thing, but every comedian that he's mentioned as

[<a id="00-35-47">00:35:47</a>]  a prime example, it like everyone he goes after and that, what's that black comedian

[<a id="00-35-54">00:35:54</a>]  that just did it recently talk shit about all the other black comedians.

[<a id="00-35-57">00:35:57</a>]  What am I forgetting?

[<a id="00-35-58">00:35:58</a>]  He's huge.

[<a id="00-35-59">00:35:59</a>]  I don't know.

[<a id="00-36-00">00:36:00</a>]  American?

[<a id="00-36-01">00:36:01</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-36-02">00:36:02</a>]  Um, oh my God, why am I blanking?

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  He just, he had like 20 million views or some shit with the podcast, some Shea Shea or whatever

[<a id="00-36-11">00:36:11</a>]  the podcast.

[<a id="00-36-12">00:36:12</a>]  And uh.

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  Shea Shea.

[<a id="00-36-14">00:36:14</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-36-15">00:36:15</a>]  Th th th there's a huge black comedian was talking shit of all the other black comedians.

[<a id="00-36-21">00:36:21</a>]  All right.

[<a id="00-36-22">00:36:22</a>]  So, um, there are people like that, but, um, no, no, no, no, but look at what happened

[<a id="00-36-26">00:36:26</a>]  over the last five, six years of comedy at all the people that went in the direction.

[<a id="00-36-33">00:36:33</a>]  It was a choice.

[<a id="00-36-34">00:36:34</a>]  It's like you got your bank coming in.

[<a id="00-36-36">00:36:36</a>]  If you, if you do the right talking points and instead of doing comedy, you start shaming

[<a id="00-36-42">00:36:42</a>]  people who don't have woke opinions and all this kind of shit that was going on with counseling

[<a id="00-36-47">00:36:47</a>]  and all the people got in line because this was their bread trade.

[<a id="00-36-52">00:36:52</a>]  I mean, I mean, okay, I'll, I'll talk shit for cat Williams.

[<a id="00-36-56">00:36:56</a>]  Remember he was talking about it.

[<a id="00-36-57">00:36:57</a>]  Fucking.

[<a id="00-36-58">00:36:58</a>]  Yeah, exactly.

[<a id="00-36-59">00:36:59</a>]  And this, yeah.

[<a id="00-37-00">00:37:00</a>]  Cat Williams or Patton Oswald is a prime example of a guy who, who may have killed his wife.

[<a id="00-37-08">00:37:08</a>]  Let's get in.

[<a id="00-37-09">00:37:09</a>]  Wow.

[<a id="00-37-10">00:37:10</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-37-11">00:37:11</a>]  And as has kissed the butt of the people that provide him the money and he's, he used to

[<a id="00-37-16">00:37:16</a>]  be funny maybe at one point.

[<a id="00-37-18">00:37:18</a>]  Now it's just a kiss.

[<a id="00-37-19">00:37:19</a>]  That's, I mean, it's the same in the UK.

[<a id="00-37-21">00:37:21</a>]  That's why you've got this fucking miserable, don't, don't forget to say allegedly.

[<a id="00-37-27">00:37:27</a>]  I'm not saying, I'm not saying what you say, what you're wrong.

[<a id="00-37-31">00:37:31</a>]  I don't tell people, I don't censor anyone, but I'm going to say stuff like that.

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  Always remember your best friend allegedly.

[<a id="00-37-37">00:37:37</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-37-38">00:37:38</a>]  It might have been right before now, but the thing is, but, but I mean, it's that simple.

[<a id="00-37-46">00:37:46</a>]  If you've got money and I could see how, if I'm, if, if I'm paying a mortgage and a family

[<a id="00-37-51">00:37:51</a>]  and I got a shit ton of money coming in and they say, Harry, could you stop doing jokes

[<a id="00-37-56">00:37:56</a>]  about X, Y, and Z and do more jokes about A, B, and C. And by the way, we've even written

[<a id="00-38-02">00:38:02</a>]  some jokes for you.

[<a id="00-38-03">00:38:03</a>]  Just, just do this.

[<a id="00-38-04">00:38:04</a>]  I'd be like, I'd probably be like, yeah, I'm sure.

[<a id="00-38-07">00:38:07</a>]  Because you're now a brand for real.

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  If I'm you, you're paying me like 10 million a year to do this shit.

[<a id="00-38-14">00:38:14</a>]  And then they say, but if you don't do it, then you're back to doing comedy clubs and

[<a id="00-38-18">00:38:18</a>]  earning money.

[<a id="00-38-19">00:38:19</a>]  Sadly, there's a lot of truth in that though.

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  You know, like how is that shocking to you?

[<a id="00-38-25">00:38:25</a>]  That's like how corruption always works is it's, it's, it's just the, the moment, the

[<a id="00-38-31">00:38:31</a>]  moment someone.

[<a id="00-38-32">00:38:32</a>]  I don't want to say corruption either, but you know, you, if you, if you're, if you have

[<a id="00-38-35">00:38:35</a>]  a big TV show, you work in a big corporate entity, they're fucking paying you.

[<a id="00-38-41">00:38:41</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-38-42">00:38:42</a>]  And they're saying like, don't do that, whatever.

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  You got to think for a second.

[<a id="00-38-46">00:38:46</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-38-47">00:38:47</a>]  And of course it's easy for us.

[<a id="00-38-48">00:38:48</a>]  I'm like, I'm not fucking do that.

[<a id="00-38-49">00:38:49</a>]  But yeah, when you got nothing, it's easy to say, fuck, but when they start giving you

[<a id="00-38-54">00:38:54</a>]  millions and millions, it's a really difficult thing to do.

[<a id="00-38-56">00:38:56</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-38-57">00:38:57</a>]  I'm just, I'm just being realistic.

[<a id="00-38-58">00:38:58</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-38-59">00:38:59</a>]  And, um, the thing I'm going to tell you, um, maybe that's not the case, but at least like

[<a id="00-39-06">00:39:06</a>]  10, 15 years ago, I could think certain certain faces do pop in my head.

[<a id="00-39-09">00:39:09</a>]  They're doing completely things that they don't believe in.

[<a id="00-39-13">00:39:13</a>]  I don't want to name names because it's just, I don't want to get ahead of, do you know

[<a id="00-39-16">00:39:16</a>]  this story about, um, Machiavelli was, you know, he was dying, right?

[<a id="00-39-25">00:39:25</a>]  And then they called a priest and priest supposedly went over there and say, uh, my, my dear son,

[<a id="00-39-30">00:39:30</a>]  are you ready to renounce Satan?

[<a id="00-39-32">00:39:32</a>]  Without hesitation, Machiavelli said, sir, father, this is not a time to make new enemy.

[<a id="00-39-38">00:39:38</a>]  And um, and then it's certain no one by talking about that, but I'm just telling in LA, it's

[<a id="00-39-44">00:39:44</a>]  some of the stuff is like, um, you know, when, when, when sometimes, uh, this us president,

[<a id="00-39-52">00:39:52</a>]  you know, attack other countries like Cuba and say, you know, North Korean saying you

[<a id="00-39-55">00:39:55</a>]  guys have a state sanction, uh, um, um, media or a propaganda thing or whatever.

[<a id="00-40-02">00:40:02</a>]  But really, I mean, you honestly think we don't have in USA these, these media company

[<a id="00-40-08">00:40:08</a>]  have to get licensed from the government.

[<a id="00-40-10">00:40:10</a>]  If you keep talking about something terrible, they're not going to get the license, you

[<a id="00-40-12">00:40:12</a>]  know?

[<a id="00-40-13">00:40:13</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-40-14">00:40:14</a>]  We have a state run indirectly media, you know, so we have first amendment, but they're

[<a id="00-40-20">00:40:20</a>]  constantly fighting between censorship, free speech, but also in between show business

[<a id="00-40-25">00:40:25</a>]  stuff, you know, sometimes we have to self censor stuff because look, if you have a 20,

[<a id="00-40-34">00:40:34</a>]  25, 30 million dollar job for working with those TV shows and don't talk about it, like

[<a id="00-40-39">00:40:39</a>]  it's a lot of fucking money, man.

[<a id="00-40-40">00:40:40</a>]  I mean, I don't think I'm better than those people.

[<a id="00-40-42">00:40:42</a>]  I don't think they're, you know, I understand, you know, I'm not, I'm not saying that I'm

[<a id="00-40-46">00:40:46</a>]  surprised about the corruption of money.

[<a id="00-40-49">00:40:49</a>]  That's not what I'm surprised about.

[<a id="00-40-50">00:40:50</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-40-51">00:40:51</a>]  I'm surprised about the fact that it seems, it seems more normal than I thought it was.

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-40-59">00:40:59</a>]  Let me explain what I mean.

[<a id="00-41-01">00:41:01</a>]  I truly, truly, truly believe that a comedy in its, in its honest form always brings out

[<a id="00-41-10">00:41:10</a>]  the best comedians first.

[<a id="00-41-12">00:41:12</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-41-13">00:41:13</a>]  Always.

[<a id="00-41-14">00:41:14</a>]  Doesn't matter.

[<a id="00-41-15">00:41:15</a>]  No, there are, there are best people out there.

[<a id="00-41-16">00:41:16</a>]  It's just they don't get recognized, get reward for it because there's plenty of great ones

[<a id="00-41-19">00:41:19</a>]  nobody knows.

[<a id="00-41-20">00:41:20</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-41-21">00:41:21</a>]  We were, we were talking about this before that the measure of money does not translate

[<a id="00-41-26">00:41:26</a>]  to go comedy.

[<a id="00-41-27">00:41:27</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-41-28">00:41:28</a>]  But the public make that mistake, you know?

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  And here's, here's the other thing, let's shit on the audiences as well, because there's

[<a id="00-41-34">00:41:34</a>]  a, there's a, there's a factor with human beings that if somebody is famous, there are

[<a id="00-41-40">00:41:40</a>]  idiots that will go to see that person simply because they're a sensation.

[<a id="00-41-45">00:41:45</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-41-46">00:41:46</a>]  And, and, and that is probably, and that's very easy to hack because it's simple FOMO.

[<a id="00-41-51">00:41:51</a>]  It's like, Oh, well everybody knows this guy.

[<a id="00-41-54">00:41:54</a>]  Oh, Taylor Swift.

[<a id="00-41-55">00:41:55</a>]  I mean, we had Taylor Swift in Zurich about, what was it, two months ago, four months ago.

[<a id="00-42-03">00:42:03</a>]  People, people were putting their flats on Airbnb for like two grand a night.

[<a id="00-42-10">00:42:10</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-42-11">00:42:11</a>]  There's people flying, like dad's flying their kids to Taylor Swift from all over Europe

[<a id="00-42-17">00:42:17</a>]  and, and Taylor Swift, I'm sorry, she's all right, but she ain't that level of, of musical

[<a id="00-42-23">00:42:23</a>]  talent.

[<a id="00-42-24">00:42:24</a>]  It's, it's, of course, marketplace disagree with you who would marketplace I compared

[<a id="00-42-31">00:42:31</a>]  to like real talent from the past.

[<a id="00-42-34">00:42:34</a>]  She's no, no, no.

[<a id="00-42-35">00:42:35</a>]  I'm just saying marketplace.

[<a id="00-42-36">00:42:36</a>]  Doesn't care about the talent.

[<a id="00-42-37">00:42:37</a>]  It takes out.

[<a id="00-42-38">00:42:38</a>]  Yeah, exactly.

[<a id="00-42-39">00:42:39</a>]  Because she's a sense.

[<a id="00-42-40">00:42:40</a>]  And a lot of the people that will follow Taylor Swift is simply because Taylor Swift is everywhere.

[<a id="00-42-45">00:42:45</a>]  So if you can, it's probably cheaper to get a ticket here than in state because it's insanely

[<a id="00-42-49">00:42:49</a>]  expensive when she's performing over there.

[<a id="00-42-51">00:42:51</a>]  Yeah, maybe.

[<a id="00-42-52">00:42:52</a>]  That was a, that was a thing.

[<a id="00-42-53">00:42:53</a>]  There was a lot of flights.

[<a id="00-42-54">00:42:54</a>]  Sometimes they say like, it's cheaper to fly first client business class to France to get

[<a id="00-42-59">00:42:59</a>]  a ticket and watch with the family.

[<a id="00-43-00">00:43:00</a>]  That was still cheaper than what you say.

[<a id="00-43-03">00:43:03</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-43-04">00:43:04</a>]  Nikki glazes.

[<a id="00-43-05">00:43:05</a>]  I don't know something like, I don't know something crazy amount of money to see with

[<a id="00-43-07">00:43:07</a>]  her and her friends or something.

[<a id="00-43-08">00:43:08</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-43-09">00:43:09</a>]  But she went to Vienna.

[<a id="00-43-10">00:43:10</a>]  Oh, is that what it is?

[<a id="00-43-11">00:43:11</a>]  Nikki did.

[<a id="00-43-12">00:43:12</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-43-13">00:43:13</a>]  So, but yeah, so I don't want you to be cynical.

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  I'm just, I was simply saying just regarding program.

[<a id="00-43-19">00:43:19</a>]  I was just saying like the direct kids and I don't hate them.

[<a id="00-43-23">00:43:23</a>]  I'm just like, good for you because I'm so impractical.

[<a id="00-43-26">00:43:26</a>]  I'm willing to do that.

[<a id="00-43-27">00:43:27</a>]  But there are comedians, look, when I talk with like all this so-called real comedians,

[<a id="00-43-32">00:43:32</a>]  I just know them.

[<a id="00-43-33">00:43:33</a>]  And then sometimes I get lucky to hang out.

[<a id="00-43-35">00:43:35</a>]  And when I hear them talk, what they really think, and of course, you know, it's like

[<a id="00-43-40">00:43:40</a>]  they are the highest level, but sometimes, you know, the public don't just imagine there

[<a id="00-43-46">00:43:46</a>]  is some kind of like a white California roll, big franchise sushi place versus some master

[<a id="00-43-52">00:43:52</a>]  sushi chef.

[<a id="00-43-53">00:43:53</a>]  He's never going to get that kind of claim, right?

[<a id="00-43-55">00:43:55</a>]  But clearly this motherfucker is a master at it.

[<a id="00-43-58">00:43:58</a>]  But you're just nailing something there because that guy cannot franchise his skill.

[<a id="00-44-04">00:44:04</a>]  That means he has to play to a smaller audience to give the best experience in the first place.

[<a id="00-44-10">00:44:10</a>]  And I don't believe, frankly, that stadiums are that great of a comedy venue.

[<a id="00-44-17">00:44:17</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-44-18">00:44:18</a>]  A lot of people don't know that.

[<a id="00-44-19">00:44:19</a>]  But you know what they say that it's always the loudest idiot get the most attention.

[<a id="00-44-25">00:44:25</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-44-26">00:44:26</a>]  Let's not talk about my president now.

[<a id="00-44-28">00:44:28</a>]  But you know, just little...

[<a id="00-44-31">00:44:31</a>]  The president of course.

[<a id="00-44-32">00:44:32</a>]  I just got to reconcile with like there are people that I knew in my lifetime that passed

[<a id="00-44-35">00:44:35</a>]  away.

[<a id="00-44-36">00:44:36</a>]  God, the phenomenal comedians.

[<a id="00-44-37">00:44:37</a>]  You will never, ever know them, you know, and that does make me sad.

[<a id="00-44-41">00:44:41</a>]  I don't care about me.

[<a id="00-44-44">00:44:44</a>]  Because I live such a retarded way, but in some ways I'm freer than a lot of the people

[<a id="00-44-48">00:44:48</a>]  that I know.

[<a id="00-44-49">00:44:49</a>]  I could live with that, you know.

[<a id="00-44-51">00:44:51</a>]  Because you're not chasing the paycheck in that regard.

[<a id="00-44-56">00:44:56</a>]  It's not that I don't want money, it's just I know myself well enough, it's not compatible

[<a id="00-45-01">00:45:01</a>]  with my personality, you know.

[<a id="00-45-03">00:45:03</a>]  I think, I mean, to me it's...

[<a id="00-45-04">00:45:04</a>]  Does that make sense?

[<a id="00-45-05">00:45:05</a>]  I would like to have money, but you know, it's...

[<a id="00-45-07">00:45:07</a>]  And I see that with some of the people in us, the scene we have in Zurich.

[<a id="00-45-11">00:45:11</a>]  I mean, to me I think what made the reassuring thing is just keep working on the art anyway.

[<a id="00-45-17">00:45:17</a>]  You're a comedy nerd.

[<a id="00-45-18">00:45:18</a>]  You know who good comedians are.

[<a id="00-45-21">00:45:21</a>]  That's also a problem is that what you and I like as comedians is not the same as what

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  dude on the street would like as a comedian.

[<a id="00-45-30">00:45:30</a>]  But there's like whether you do it for the pleasure and if you could...

[<a id="00-45-35">00:45:35</a>]  Like doing a room of 50 people or even less is so much fun.

[<a id="00-45-41">00:45:41</a>]  And then we've got other people here who are like devil ambition.

[<a id="00-45-46">00:45:46</a>]  They're just trying to figure out new ways to get even more attention online and it's

[<a id="00-45-54">00:45:54</a>]  a real metric.

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  It's like the metric is, I mean, in the end it's nice if you can do a tour and get people

[<a id="00-46-01">00:46:01</a>]  out and sell out whatever room you're in, but at the same point we're kind of idolizing

[<a id="00-46-09">00:46:09</a>]  the wrong things.

[<a id="00-46-10">00:46:10</a>]  It's like I think Viktor Petrashko and his Romanian Comedian tours around is fantastic.

[<a id="00-46-17">00:46:17</a>]  I don't want his lifestyle because he travels all the time and he works like crazy and every

[<a id="00-46-23">00:46:23</a>]  night he's somewhere else and he's blown up now.

[<a id="00-46-26">00:46:26</a>]  Obviously I live in the States and I think out of the last 15, 20 years the guy who has

[<a id="00-46-33">00:46:33</a>]  all the right combination and having success and made very, very little compromise in my

[<a id="00-46-37">00:46:37</a>]  opinion is Bill Burr.

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  Not only does he have his home situation with his wife, seemed like a very successful marriage,

[<a id="00-46-45">00:46:45</a>]  you never hear anything bad that he's ever done, never because I don't think that's within

[<a id="00-46-49">00:46:49</a>]  him and I met him a couple of times like, wow, even without a camera on he conducts himself

[<a id="00-46-54">00:46:54</a>]  in a really friendly, kind, dignified way.

[<a id="00-47-01">00:47:01</a>]  I love Louis, I don't know him that well, but honestly what he did, I think it was a

[<a id="00-47-07">00:47:07</a>]  lot of overreaction because compared to Y, they were trying to put him in the same category

[<a id="00-47-11">00:47:11</a>]  as the other monsters, but I just saw him like two weeks ago and I have to say overall

[<a id="00-47-18">00:47:18</a>]  he has the success, the respect for comedians, quality comedy and he's doing a lot of interesting

[<a id="00-47-23">00:47:23</a>]  stuff.

[<a id="00-47-24">00:47:24</a>]  So I think there are people like that, of course, he doesn't do those algorithm comedy

[<a id="00-47-30">00:47:30</a>]  or programming comedy, whatever you want to call it, there are people like that, but there's

[<a id="00-47-34">00:47:34</a>]  also like tendency like you do one minute joke and hopefully they'll get to a Hall of

[<a id="00-47-42">00:47:42</a>]  Fame career.

[<a id="00-47-43">00:47:43</a>]  I don't know, I don't know about that either.

[<a id="00-47-47">00:47:47</a>]  People want just validation right away, you know, that's a tough one.

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  Maybe I am idealizing the whole idea of comedy.

[<a id="00-47-55">00:47:55</a>]  Which is okay because I could be wrong, you know.

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  But maybe it's just to make the distinction is that there's comedy the art and then there's

[<a id="00-48-03">00:48:03</a>]  comedy the business and for me the stuff I enjoy the most about comedy is the art and

[<a id="00-48-12">00:48:12</a>]  we organize shows and do stuff.

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  That side of things is mostly a grind and then that thing has taught me more and more

[<a id="00-48-22">00:48:22</a>]  to be a bit of an asshole and be it like, I don't know, comedians, we've got beginning

[<a id="00-48-29">00:48:29</a>]  comedians who do shit like cancel, oh, one hour before a show, oh, I can't make it and

[<a id="00-48-37">00:48:37</a>]  say, okay, fine and then next time you're not going to be getting a spot and I might

[<a id="00-48-43">00:48:43</a>]  not even say that.

[<a id="00-48-44">00:48:44</a>]  I might just let them feel it because I start to, for the organizational part, this is my

[<a id="00-48-50">00:48:50</a>]  life and time and energy that I got to say that's a lot of fucking work.

[<a id="00-48-55">00:48:55</a>]  Yeah, it is.

[<a id="00-48-56">00:48:56</a>]  I mean, I rearranging furniture, putting that shit up, you know, and I gotta do it again

[<a id="00-49-00">00:49:00</a>]  tonight and it's three times as we, but anyway, it's just, I began with, because I always

[<a id="00-49-10">00:49:10</a>]  did in a space of like kind of a generosity and over time that generosity is dwindling

[<a id="00-49-16">00:49:16</a>]  because yeah, it's just like the business side of it is kind of a bit, there's just

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  I'm not sure.

[<a id="00-49-26">00:49:26</a>]  I'm not sure that's an asshole move though because it is a quality assurance as well.

[<a id="00-49-31">00:49:31</a>]  Like if a comedian in the example that you just made doesn't take the gig seriously,

[<a id="00-49-40">00:49:40</a>]  then that means they don't take the audience seriously either.

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-43">00:49:43</a>]  And you shouldn't take them serious either.

[<a id="00-49-44">00:49:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-45">00:49:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-46">00:49:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-47">00:49:47</a>]  But I mean, I use it as one example.

[<a id="00-49-48">00:49:48</a>]  It's just, it's just like the business.

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  Of course, you find out later on his mom died and you're like, fuck your mom, you're not

[<a id="00-49-54">00:49:54</a>]  working here anymore.

[<a id="00-49-55">00:49:55</a>]  You son of a bitch.

[<a id="00-49-56">00:49:56</a>]  I actually just think back at all the gigs that I canceled this year where I go like,

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  whoosh.

[<a id="00-50-01">00:50:01</a>]  I was definitely not always super clean on this front, but it has to do with that.

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  It's like if you treat, if you treat the gig kind of like a second thought, it's like,

[<a id="00-50-12">00:50:12</a>]  oh, sorry, I can't make it tonight.

[<a id="00-50-15">00:50:15</a>]  Like you know a shitty friend that you didn't want to go have drinks with in the first place.

[<a id="00-50-21">00:50:21</a>]  Then you're not doing, you're not having the respect to the audience either.

[<a id="00-50-25">00:50:25</a>]  So why the fuck have that guy on stage?

[<a id="00-50-27">00:50:27</a>]  Can I tell you something surprising about you guys in the scene over here?

[<a id="00-50-34">00:50:34</a>]  I can't get over it because when I was doing shows in Seattle, I missed those days, you

[<a id="00-50-39">00:50:39</a>]  know, because I never had a replicate experience like that.

[<a id="00-50-43">00:50:43</a>]  Like I went to LA and whatever, but it's just different groups of people.

[<a id="00-50-45">00:50:45</a>]  It doesn't, they didn't have the same feel about that.

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  When I was starting in Seattle, it just felt like it was magical, you know, and you guys

[<a id="00-50-55">00:50:55</a>]  have a little bit of that here.

[<a id="00-50-57">00:50:57</a>]  Like I kind of like you guys take it serious and you're passionate and people are not catty

[<a id="00-51-03">00:51:03</a>]  over here and you have enough like audience.

[<a id="00-51-06">00:51:06</a>]  You can't do stuff and what I like, I was wrong.

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  I didn't know what to expect, but if you're tolerant enough to have that Tuesday, shows

[<a id="00-51-14">00:51:14</a>]  like Tuesday, yeah, I think you guys got something here.

[<a id="00-51-19">00:51:19</a>]  I wasn't really sure, you know, but no, when I moved to LA, like because I worked in sex

[<a id="00-51-24">00:51:24</a>]  work and this like over 20 years ago, but there's things that some comedians are like,

[<a id="00-51-28">00:51:28</a>]  I can't be part of this shit, man.

[<a id="00-51-30">00:51:30</a>]  You can't call them girls, some of them are grabbing chicks and stuff like that.

[<a id="00-51-34">00:51:34</a>]  You know, like no, I mean like I didn't know what to, it was so crazy back then, you know,

[<a id="00-51-39">00:51:39</a>]  so never really felt comfortable there.

[<a id="00-51-41">00:51:41</a>]  But Seattle days, I really, really missed that.

[<a id="00-51-44">00:51:44</a>]  But now when I go back, Woke is none of my friends is doing stuff, it's just like that

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  place is dead to me.

[<a id="00-51-50">00:51:50</a>]  So I don't have.

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  I can't really see you play in Portland.

[<a id="00-51-52">00:51:52</a>]  I mean.

[<a id="00-51-53">00:51:53</a>]  I've done it, I've done it recently with Russell and I was saying foul shit, but they loved

[<a id="00-51-57">00:51:57</a>]  it because most of his fans are not white Woke people and a few of them are in the room.

[<a id="00-52-03">00:52:03</a>]  When I say those godless faggots, they have to kind of sit down and take it, you know,

[<a id="00-52-08">00:52:08</a>]  because believe me, those Muslim people, they don't like that transgender shit at all.

[<a id="00-52-12">00:52:12</a>]  You don't bring that shit to my kids, I'll go Jihad on your ass, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-52-17">00:52:17</a>]  So that was fun because I went to Woke City with Russell and I said those terrible things

[<a id="00-52-21">00:52:21</a>]  that they don't want to hear, but they can't really do anything because plenty of black

[<a id="00-52-25">00:52:25</a>]  Seattle brown people are like, yeah, we don't like that shit.

[<a id="00-52-28">00:52:28</a>]  What are you going to do now?

[<a id="00-52-29">00:52:29</a>]  You know?

[<a id="00-52-30">00:52:30</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-52-31">00:52:31</a>]  I mean, I think I appreciate what you're saying about seeing, I think we've, weirdly, I've

[<a id="00-52-36">00:52:36</a>]  got a feeling that there's a chance with some might produce some of the one or two really

[<a id="00-52-44">00:52:44</a>]  good comedians on a world stage within maybe the next 10 years or so.

[<a id="00-52-48">00:52:48</a>]  And it might be quicker than that because I think you just need to set up a system where

[<a id="00-52-54">00:52:54</a>]  at least there's places where comedians could go and do that, you know?

[<a id="00-52-58">00:52:58</a>]  But I think, I don't know what's going on in Seattle, but I don't like what's going on

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  over there.

[<a id="00-53-02">00:53:02</a>]  Well, I think, I mean, the thing here, what makes this thing work here is number one is

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  for the English comedy, there's a lot of loneliness here, especially for the foreign workers that

[<a id="00-53-12">00:53:12</a>]  come here because it's very hard to make friends in the city.

[<a id="00-53-16">00:53:16</a>]  I didn't even think about that.

[<a id="00-53-18">00:53:18</a>]  And so that works, I think.

[<a id="00-53-21">00:53:21</a>]  You're kind of talking about Tokyo right now.

[<a id="00-53-23">00:53:23</a>]  Go ahead.

[<a id="00-53-24">00:53:24</a>]  It's a little bit like that.

[<a id="00-53-25">00:53:25</a>]  It has that thing.

[<a id="00-53-27">00:53:27</a>]  And then you've got, there's been little bits of, like some parts of the comedy scene here

[<a id="00-53-35">00:53:35</a>]  have gone a little bit of an agenda.

[<a id="00-53-38">00:53:38</a>]  The shows that I organize, my philosophy is just funny is decided by the audience, nobody

[<a id="00-53-44">00:53:44</a>]  else.

[<a id="00-53-45">00:53:45</a>]  And so if somebody says something that offends people and nobody laughs, then you got the

[<a id="00-53-50">00:53:50</a>]  feedback that you needed.

[<a id="00-53-51">00:53:51</a>]  I don't need to.

[<a id="00-53-52">00:53:52</a>]  I got it a couple of days ago.

[<a id="00-53-56">00:53:56</a>]  And then the rest of it, I don't, there's been very little, there's been little incidents

[<a id="00-54-00">00:54:00</a>]  of creepiness, but nothing too major on the scene between the comedians.

[<a id="00-54-07">00:54:07</a>]  And maybe to wrap up on the kind of, we've got not as many female comedians as men, but

[<a id="00-54-14">00:54:14</a>]  they get more opportunities than the men because they were trying to create balanced lineups.

[<a id="00-54-18">00:54:18</a>]  I'm sure that will start changing.

[<a id="00-54-21">00:54:21</a>]  One time we did a show, and I don't think there's so few female comedians.

[<a id="00-54-27">00:54:27</a>]  It's not that there's few that it's like, I guess it's like 70% male, 30% female.

[<a id="00-54-33">00:54:33</a>]  You'll see one tonight.

[<a id="00-54-34">00:54:34</a>]  She's very funny.

[<a id="00-54-35">00:54:35</a>]  And I think that's kind of norm in history center.

[<a id="00-54-38">00:54:38</a>]  Maybe this is different last 10 years, but I mean, let me say the nice thing first and

[<a id="00-54-43">00:54:43</a>]  then say some funny misogynistic stuff.

[<a id="00-54-45">00:54:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-54-46">00:54:46</a>]  So you don't have to say funny misogynistic, they're all funny and true.

[<a id="00-54-52">00:54:52</a>]  But the thing is, so we do this, I love saying stuff like that because they just, it's just

[<a id="00-54-55">00:54:55</a>]  for him and like, Oh no, what did I do?

[<a id="00-54-57">00:54:57</a>]  Cause I would, I'd always assume that on the scene, it's, we're just joking everyone.

[<a id="00-55-03">00:55:03</a>]  It's the male comedians are the dirt bags doing the offensive jokes or the dark jokes.

[<a id="00-55-09">00:55:09</a>]  But one night we had like, it was 50/50 half the comedians were female.

[<a id="00-55-13">00:55:13</a>]  So I put all the women in the second half guys come up and do a bunch of like sex and

[<a id="00-55-18">00:55:18</a>]  big jokes and whatever funny, uh, the women, holy shit.

[<a id="00-55-24">00:55:24</a>]  Were they all dark?

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  It was like Ludovico some others and, and, and it just like, you suddenly saw holy shit

[<a id="00-55-31">00:55:31</a>]  in a way.

[<a id="00-55-32">00:55:32</a>]  They're way funnier.

[<a id="00-55-33">00:55:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-55-34">00:55:34</a>]  And, but, but I mean, apart from the fact that there's less of them, uh, they're also

[<a id="00-55-40">00:55:40</a>]  all synchronized.

[<a id="00-55-41">00:55:41</a>]  So like certain times of the month, there's no female comedians coming out.

[<a id="00-55-45">00:55:45</a>]  It's, you know, it's a, it's a problem.

[<a id="00-55-49">00:55:49</a>]  And you know, and the most last minute, no one, no wonder your son want to talk to me

[<a id="00-55-53">00:55:53</a>]  and I, you know, most last minute cancellations come from female comedians.

[<a id="00-55-58">00:55:58</a>]  And also there's a tendency, I got to say, this is now really one difference is the male

[<a id="00-56-05">00:56:05</a>]  in general.

[<a id="00-56-06">00:56:06</a>]  There's a big generalization.

[<a id="00-56-07">00:56:07</a>]  I know who said it in this episode, the male comedians generally work harder.

[<a id="00-56-13">00:56:13</a>]  The ones that stick it out.

[<a id="00-56-14">00:56:14</a>]  Fuck me.

[<a id="00-56-15">00:56:15</a>]  No, it's true because, because there are some really good female comedians.

[<a id="00-56-20">00:56:20</a>]  There are some really working hard and I respect that, but there are others that are just like,

[<a id="00-56-25">00:56:25</a>]  yeah.

[<a id="00-56-26">00:56:26</a>]  Can I tell you something strange?

[<a id="00-56-28">00:56:28</a>]  I'm hot.

[<a id="00-56-29">00:56:29</a>]  I don't need to write jokes.

[<a id="00-56-30">00:56:30</a>]  Can I tell you, my friend, my friend, Ariel runs a show in Austin, um, Tuesday night.

[<a id="00-56-34">00:56:34</a>]  It's like a gay show and I do a show.

[<a id="00-56-38">00:56:38</a>]  And when you do the show and you're not gay, you had to wear this like a hat, the shape

[<a id="00-56-41">00:56:41</a>]  like shit.

[<a id="00-56-42">00:56:42</a>]  Anyway, I was doing the show.

[<a id="00-56-44">00:56:44</a>]  The last time I did it, um, they were laughing at the beginning, but I said, oh, by the way,

[<a id="00-56-49">00:56:49</a>]  today Netflix is releasing Ellen D. Jenner's new special.

[<a id="00-56-55">00:56:55</a>]  And I said like, no matter how you feel about her, I saw her in person in New York City

[<a id="00-57-00">00:57:00</a>]  like three weeks ago.

[<a id="00-57-01">00:57:01</a>]  She is absolutely upstanding.

[<a id="00-57-03">00:57:03</a>]  I always knew she was great, but when she ran out, this is the last time she'll be performing.

[<a id="00-57-07">00:57:07</a>]  I really had to go and I went and she did not disappoint me at all.

[<a id="00-57-11">00:57:11</a>]  She was exactly who I thought.

[<a id="00-57-12">00:57:12</a>]  It's an incredible hour stand up.

[<a id="00-57-14">00:57:14</a>]  What's amazing is it's not like she went to different club work than an hour.

[<a id="00-57-18">00:57:18</a>]  She wrote this thing.

[<a id="00-57-19">00:57:19</a>]  She just went on tour.

[<a id="00-57-20">00:57:20</a>]  That's how good she is.

[<a id="00-57-21">00:57:21</a>]  Right?

[<a id="00-57-22">00:57:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-57-23">00:57:23</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-57-24">00:57:24</a>]  And that takes work.

[<a id="00-57-25">00:57:25</a>]  It's a lot of work and she know how to do that.

[<a id="00-57-26">00:57:26</a>]  Get this, the women in the room, most of them, they say no.

[<a id="00-57-33">00:57:33</a>]  And I said like, why?

[<a id="00-57-35">00:57:35</a>]  Because she's been canceled and they're very young women.

[<a id="00-57-38">00:57:38</a>]  What?

[<a id="00-57-39">00:57:39</a>]  And then I said like, do you know, she was the first woman to be on Johnny Carson show

[<a id="00-57-47">00:57:47</a>]  and she got this thing because she killed it hard, right?

[<a id="00-57-50">00:57:50</a>]  She was first one to get on, first one to do really, really well.

[<a id="00-57-54">00:57:54</a>]  And you think men are misogynistic now during stand up comedy.

[<a id="00-57-57">00:57:57</a>]  Imagine when she was in her seventies and eighties, right?

[<a id="00-57-59">00:57:59</a>]  Jesus Christ.

[<a id="00-58-00">00:58:00</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-01">00:58:01</a>]  You can't even, you can't even imagine this.

[<a id="00-58-02">00:58:02</a>]  It's an uphill battle as fuck.

[<a id="00-58-04">00:58:04</a>]  If there's a person who say Traeger and PTSD is Ellen.

[<a id="00-58-08">00:58:08</a>]  So look, I'm not saying what she did was right.

[<a id="00-58-11">00:58:11</a>]  If it was a male boss doing the same thing, I don't think they would have said anything.

[<a id="00-58-16">00:58:16</a>]  She yelled at some young people.

[<a id="00-58-18">00:58:18</a>]  What's wrong with that?

[<a id="00-58-19">00:58:19</a>]  They need yelling at.

[<a id="00-58-20">00:58:20</a>]  That's so she went, she went through it.

[<a id="00-58-24">00:58:24</a>]  She went through a very, very difficult time and for her to fight through it.

[<a id="00-58-28">00:58:28</a>]  And not only that, and most of the bisexual gay people, you're not old enough to remember.

[<a id="00-58-34">00:58:34</a>]  She was the first person to come out of class in sitcom and she paid a heavy price for that,

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  you know, afterward, maybe less than one more year or something like that.

[<a id="00-58-44">00:58:44</a>]  And so she went through a hard time.

[<a id="00-58-46">00:58:46</a>]  And I can't imagine if I was treated that way, maybe I'm not going to be a nice person.

[<a id="00-58-49">00:58:49</a>]  So I'm just asking you to find a place in your heart to forgive her and give her a chance.

[<a id="00-58-56">00:58:56</a>]  And they said, no, you know how crazy it is?

[<a id="00-58-59">00:58:59</a>]  Here is racist, sexist, you know, like not liking anyone.

[<a id="00-59-04">00:59:04</a>]  I'm defending Ellen in a room full of gay and lesbian show.

[<a id="00-59-09">00:59:09</a>]  And my friend Ariel loves Ellen because I didn't know she was in the same room in New

[<a id="00-59-14">00:59:14</a>]  York in theater.

[<a id="00-59-15">00:59:15</a>]  I didn't know she was there.

[<a id="00-59-16">00:59:16</a>]  We talked about it afterwards, like she loved Ellen too, but like she's not going to go

[<a id="00-59-20">00:59:20</a>]  against that woke tsunami, you know what I mean, her audience.

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  But isn't that crazy?

[<a id="00-59-25">00:59:25</a>]  I'm defending Ellen in a gay room.

[<a id="00-59-28">00:59:28</a>]  Do you understand how crazy this is?

[<a id="00-59-31">00:59:31</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-59-32">00:59:32</a>]  I love Ellen.

[<a id="00-59-33">00:59:33</a>]  All right.

[<a id="00-59-34">00:59:34</a>]  I watch her special.

[<a id="00-59-35">00:59:35</a>]  She's great.

[<a id="00-59-36">00:59:36</a>]  I don't care what people say.

[<a id="00-59-37">00:59:37</a>]  What was it called again?

[<a id="00-59-38">00:59:38</a>]  Name of the special.

[<a id="00-59-39">00:59:39</a>]  I don't remember the special.

[<a id="00-59-40">00:59:40</a>]  I saw it and I saw it in person, but it's on Netflix.

[<a id="00-59-43">00:59:43</a>]  I mean, you know, if you're a true fan, shut the fuck up.

[<a id="00-59-47">00:59:47</a>]  All right.

[<a id="00-59-48">00:59:48</a>]  What is the word when you're an Ellen fan, but not like Taylor Swift's Swifties?

[<a id="00-59-54">00:59:54</a>]  That's a good one.

[<a id="00-59-55">00:59:55</a>]  What is it?

[<a id="00-59-56">00:59:56</a>]  I don't know.

[<a id="00-59-57">00:59:57</a>]  That's it.

[<a id="00-59-58">00:59:58</a>]  I got to go.

[<a id="00-59-59">00:59:59</a>]  Generics.

[<a id="01-00-00">01:00:00</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="01-00-01">01:00:01</a>]  All right.

[<a id="01-00-02">01:00:02</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-03">01:00:03</a>]  I mean, you two carry on.

[<a id="01-00-04">01:00:04</a>]  Just to a pause.

[<a id="01-00-05">01:00:05</a>]  No.

[<a id="01-00-06">01:00:06</a>]  You have to go.

[<a id="01-00-07">01:00:07</a>]  You have to dash as well.

[<a id="01-00-08">01:00:08</a>]  Oh, okay.

[<a id="01-00-09">01:00:09</a>]  Just send me the address and tell me when I should be there.

[<a id="01-00-10">01:00:10</a>]  You want to help me carry some stuff?

[<a id="01-00-12">01:00:12</a>]  Oh, you want to go now?

[<a id="01-00-13">01:00:13</a>]  I mean, I've got to go to Robin.

[<a id="01-00-15">01:00:15</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="01-00-16">01:00:16</a>]  So, okay.

[<a id="01-00-17">01:00:17</a>]  I got to go.

[<a id="01-00-18">01:00:18</a>]  I got to go get some stuff from Robin's and we go to the prime tower.

[<a id="01-00-22">01:00:22</a>]  I'll leave all the gear on the table like as it is and we can do this tomorrow again.

[<a id="01-00-27">01:00:27</a>]  Perfect.

[<a id="01-00-28">01:00:28</a>]  Cool.

[<a id="01-00-29">01:00:29</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="01-00-30">01:00:30</a>]  Let me put...

[<a id="01-00-31">01:00:31</a>]  Oh, no, but look, let me see if I have my pants.

[<a id="01-00-32">01:00:32</a>]  I have what?

[<a id="01-00-33">01:00:33</a>]  Oh, they're washing clothes right now.

[<a id="01-00-34">01:00:34</a>]  So I think I have one jeans.

[<a id="01-00-35">01:00:35</a>]  You need to leave like five minutes, right?

[<a id="01-00-36">01:00:36</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-37">01:00:37</a>]  They won't be dry tonight.

[<a id="01-00-38">01:00:38</a>]  I think I have one more in there.

[<a id="01-00-39">01:00:39</a>]  So jeans take a while to dry.

[<a id="01-00-40">01:00:40</a>]  I think I have one more in there.

[<a id="01-00-41">01:00:41</a>]  So jeans take a while to dry.

[<a id="01-00-42">01:00:42</a>]  I think I have one more in there.

[<a id="01-00-43">01:00:43</a>]  So jeans take a while to dry.

[<a id="01-00-44">01:00:44</a>]  I think I have one more in there.

[<a id="01-00-45">01:00:45</a>]  So jeans take a while to dry.

[<a id="01-00-46">01:00:46</a>]  I think I have one more in there.

[<a id="01-00-47">01:00:47</a>]  So jeans take a while to dry.

[<a id="01-00-48">01:00:48</a>]  I think jeans take a while to dry.
