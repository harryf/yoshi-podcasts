[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  (footsteps)

[<a id="00-00-30">00:00:30</a>]  (footsteps)

[<a id="00-00-32">00:00:32</a>]  - All right, we're back in Edinburgh.

[<a id="00-00-54">00:00:54</a>]  I didn't even know what we were talking about before.

[<a id="00-00-58">00:00:58</a>]  - Why have me, man?

[<a id="00-01-00">00:01:00</a>]  - It's been an hour ago, right, at this point?

[<a id="00-01-03">00:01:03</a>]  - About, yeah.

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  - We were rudely interrupted.

[<a id="00-01-06">00:01:06</a>]  - No.

[<a id="00-01-07">00:01:07</a>]  - What was your friend's name again?

[<a id="00-01-11">00:01:11</a>]  - Richard.

[<a id="00-01-12">00:01:12</a>]  - He was great.

[<a id="00-01-13">00:01:13</a>]  I like, it makes me laugh.

[<a id="00-01-16">00:01:16</a>]  - Can you pull the microphone a little bit closer?

[<a id="00-01-17">00:01:17</a>]  - Yeah, every time I visit a different country,

[<a id="00-01-21">00:01:21</a>]  a different city, there are different comedians,

[<a id="00-01-25">00:01:25</a>]  but there's always the same kind of comedians, you know?

[<a id="00-01-27">00:01:27</a>]  This one steals joke, this one causing problem,

[<a id="00-01-30">00:01:30</a>]  this one's the funny one, this one's the pretty one.

[<a id="00-01-32">00:01:32</a>]  It's really funny to hear that.

[<a id="00-01-34">00:01:34</a>]  - I think the scenes around the globe are kind of, yeah.

[<a id="00-01-39">00:01:39</a>]  It's also a certain type of person

[<a id="00-01-42">00:01:42</a>]  that does comedy in the end.

[<a id="00-01-43">00:01:43</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-44">00:01:44</a>]  - Yes, you have a variety of people

[<a id="00-01-45">00:01:45</a>]  that do comedy for sure.

[<a id="00-01-46">00:01:46</a>]  - Sure, there is a personality trait

[<a id="00-01-50">00:01:50</a>]  that gets people to go on stage, I reckon.

[<a id="00-01-52">00:01:52</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-53">00:01:53</a>]  - And that's kind of, it's a, you know,

[<a id="00-01-55">00:01:55</a>]  for me it's a little bit like taxi drivers.

[<a id="00-01-57">00:01:57</a>]  All the taxi drivers around the globe are the same person.

[<a id="00-02-01">00:02:01</a>]  You know what I mean?

[<a id="00-02-02">00:02:02</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-02-03">00:02:03</a>]  - You can go to Greece, you can go to Northern Germany,

[<a id="00-02-07">00:02:07</a>]  the taxi driver is the taxi driver.

[<a id="00-02-08">00:02:08</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-02-09">00:02:09</a>]  - It's always the same guy.

[<a id="00-02-11">00:02:11</a>]  - It's funny you say that 'cause when I was in Kyoto

[<a id="00-02-14">00:02:14</a>]  with Russell Peters' brother, Clayton,

[<a id="00-02-17">00:02:17</a>]  we were laughing 'cause the taxi driver in Kyoto

[<a id="00-02-20">00:02:20</a>]  was far more personable than one in Osaka, you know?

[<a id="00-02-23">00:02:23</a>]  - Oh, for real?

[<a id="00-02-24">00:02:24</a>]  - Yeah, it was funny 'cause the first guy

[<a id="00-02-26">00:02:26</a>]  picked us up at the train station,

[<a id="00-02-30">00:02:30</a>]  he must've been a former Yakuza or something.

[<a id="00-02-33">00:02:33</a>]  He just had this mannerism, like rough exterior.

[<a id="00-02-36">00:02:36</a>]  So he was like, "Where the hell do you wanna go?"

[<a id="00-02-38">00:02:38</a>]  And he was smoking cigarettes.

[<a id="00-02-39">00:02:39</a>]  - Yes, oh, the cool guy.

[<a id="00-02-42">00:02:42</a>]  - Yeah, and then the second guy was like,

[<a id="00-02-44">00:02:44</a>]  he was so eager to learn English, you know?

[<a id="00-02-46">00:02:46</a>]  He was, and he gave us discount

[<a id="00-02-48">00:02:48</a>]  because you guys give me good English.

[<a id="00-02-51">00:02:51</a>]  I've never had a taxi driver giving us a discount.

[<a id="00-02-54">00:02:54</a>]  - No, that does not happen.

[<a id="00-02-55">00:02:55</a>]  - So, yeah, there's a lot of personality types, you know?

[<a id="00-03-00">00:03:00</a>]  I know what you mean.

[<a id="00-03-02">00:03:02</a>]  - Yeah, but going back to Edinburgh,

[<a id="00-03-06">00:03:06</a>]  so you discussed that the month of August is a tough one.

[<a id="00-03-11">00:03:11</a>]  You go there, you're--

[<a id="00-03-12">00:03:12</a>]  - I mean, it's not like I'm suffering, but I--

[<a id="00-03-15">00:03:15</a>]  - No, but it's an emotional thing, right?

[<a id="00-03-17">00:03:17</a>]  - I do think about it, but that was the most

[<a id="00-03-20">00:03:20</a>]  relaxing August I ever had in my last 20 plus years.

[<a id="00-03-23">00:03:23</a>]  - So, say something about going there

[<a id="00-03-26">00:03:26</a>]  because this is the first time you did The Fringe.

[<a id="00-03-29">00:03:29</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-03-30">00:03:30</a>]  - As with your own show, right?

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  - Yeah, you know what happened was two, three years ago,

[<a id="00-03-35">00:03:35</a>]  some lady was doing a show about--

[<a id="00-03-38">00:03:38</a>]  - I'm up, there you go, yeah, okay.

[<a id="00-03-42">00:03:42</a>]  - Some lady was doing a show

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  about Ghislaine Maxwell at The Fringe.

[<a id="00-03-46">00:03:46</a>]  So I was just kind of Googling her name

[<a id="00-03-49">00:03:49</a>]  'cause at the time I was attending her court case

[<a id="00-03-52">00:03:52</a>]  and I was just reading anything about her.

[<a id="00-03-54">00:03:54</a>]  And I just read like, there's some young actress

[<a id="00-03-57">00:03:57</a>]  doing one women's show about Ghislaine.

[<a id="00-04-00">00:04:00</a>]  What is this?

[<a id="00-04-01">00:04:01</a>]  So like, I look, it's Fringe,

[<a id="00-04-03">00:04:03</a>]  and I was talking to a couple of people,

[<a id="00-04-04">00:04:04</a>]  then somebody said, "Hey, one of my friends told me

[<a id="00-04-09">00:04:09</a>]  "we have a mutual friend that's performing there,

[<a id="00-04-11">00:04:11</a>]  "so why don't you?"

[<a id="00-04-12">00:04:12</a>]  So, you know, I saw my friend Anthony performing.

[<a id="00-04-15">00:04:15</a>]  And when I went to see Ghislaine afterwards,

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  I was hanging out with Anthony,

[<a id="00-04-21">00:04:21</a>]  and it was like one of the first shows back

[<a id="00-04-23">00:04:23</a>]  from recovering from COVID.

[<a id="00-04-25">00:04:25</a>]  And I was like, what is this?

[<a id="00-04-26">00:04:26</a>]  You know, like I went to different,

[<a id="00-04-28">00:04:28</a>]  there were just all kinds of weird shit.

[<a id="00-04-30">00:04:30</a>]  So I was thinking like,

[<a id="00-04-31">00:04:31</a>]  oh, maybe I want to go back and--

[<a id="00-04-32">00:04:32</a>]  - Do your own thing.

[<a id="00-04-33">00:04:33</a>]  - Do my thing, but I didn't really want to,

[<a id="00-04-36">00:04:36</a>]  but once I made a decision to do it,

[<a id="00-04-38">00:04:38</a>]  it'll force me to work on it.

[<a id="00-04-40">00:04:40</a>]  And I really, it's closer to God,

[<a id="00-04-42">00:04:42</a>]  like, this is a fucking mistake.

[<a id="00-04-44">00:04:44</a>]  I don't want to do this, you know?

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  - It's a black hole for money as well.

[<a id="00-04-49">00:04:49</a>]  - Yeah, but it actually, considering how much people lost,

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  I actually didn't do that badly, you know?

[<a id="00-04-54">00:04:54</a>]  - Oh, good.

[<a id="00-04-55">00:04:55</a>]  - I only lost a couple thousand pounds,

[<a id="00-04-57">00:04:57</a>]  and considering how much other people are losing.

[<a id="00-05-01">00:05:01</a>]  And I think midpoint to the very end,

[<a id="00-05-05">00:05:05</a>]  I kind of figured out how to do this.

[<a id="00-05-07">00:05:07</a>]  I mean, it's been over a year and a half,

[<a id="00-05-09">00:05:09</a>]  so I don't even remember most of the show,

[<a id="00-05-12">00:05:12</a>]  but I just remember thinking like,

[<a id="00-05-14">00:05:14</a>]  how can I talk about this uncomfortable subject matter?

[<a id="00-05-18">00:05:18</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-19">00:05:19</a>]  - And I was able to do it in front of women.

[<a id="00-05-22">00:05:22</a>]  They were nodding when I,

[<a id="00-05-23">00:05:23</a>]  I know that you could talk about anything.

[<a id="00-05-25">00:05:25</a>]  I mean, literally anything, as long as audience trust you,

[<a id="00-05-30">00:05:30</a>]  and there's a reason why you're telling it,

[<a id="00-05-31">00:05:31</a>]  and it's coming from a good place.

[<a id="00-05-32">00:05:32</a>]  They will even have no issue.

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  So, you know, the name of the show is "Adult Content."

[<a id="00-05-37">00:05:37</a>]  I work in adult business, porn company, and other stuff

[<a id="00-05-41">00:05:41</a>]  relating to porn for like last 20 plus years.

[<a id="00-05-44">00:05:44</a>]  And it was a subject matter of rape in pornography,

[<a id="00-05-48">00:05:48</a>]  and it's a really uncomfortable thing to talk about,

[<a id="00-05-51">00:05:51</a>]  but I explain in a very reasonable

[<a id="00-05-55">00:05:55</a>]  and almost like a social scientific explanation

[<a id="00-05-59">00:05:59</a>]  for those fantasy.

[<a id="00-06-00">00:06:00</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-01">00:06:01</a>]  - The women were nodding their heads,

[<a id="00-06-02">00:06:02</a>]  like they were kind of surprised they were agreeing with me.

[<a id="00-06-04">00:06:04</a>]  So- - Interesting.

[<a id="00-06-05">00:06:05</a>]  - So I was able to do that, but I didn't know that.

[<a id="00-06-08">00:06:08</a>]  I didn't know, you don't know until you try something, right?

[<a id="00-06-10">00:06:10</a>]  - No, of course.

[<a id="00-06-11">00:06:11</a>]  And I think these sort of festivals and shows

[<a id="00-06-17">00:06:17</a>]  are kind of like an excellent platform

[<a id="00-06-19">00:06:19</a>]  to try stuff like that,

[<a id="00-06-22">00:06:22</a>]  because you're one amongst tens of thousands.

[<a id="00-06-27">00:06:27</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-27">00:06:27</a>]  - And you don't have to fight.

[<a id="00-06-29">00:06:29</a>]  Like, if you would have to, let's go there.

[<a id="00-06-31">00:06:31</a>]  Let's assume you would have to bring that particular show

[<a id="00-06-34">00:06:34</a>]  by yourself, untested.

[<a id="00-06-36">00:06:36</a>]  - Yeah, it really was untested.

[<a id="00-06-39">00:06:39</a>]  - There you go.

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  You bring that to the stand.

[<a id="00-06-42">00:06:42</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-42">00:06:42</a>]  - Like, that wouldn't work.

[<a id="00-06-48">00:06:48</a>]  - Yeah, I mean, you know what popped in my head

[<a id="00-06-50">00:06:50</a>]  when I was thinking about this, when I was trying,

[<a id="00-06-52">00:06:52</a>]  'cause I have some idea of what I want to talk about,

[<a id="00-06-55">00:06:55</a>]  but I was figuring it out every single day

[<a id="00-06-56">00:06:56</a>]  when I was doing it, you know?

[<a id="00-06-58">00:06:58</a>]  It's kind of like when Hitler,

[<a id="00-07-02">00:07:02</a>]  when Hitler held Franco in Spain, right?

[<a id="00-07-06">00:07:06</a>]  So Nazi had all this weapon that they haven't used it yet,

[<a id="00-07-09">00:07:09</a>]  prior to World War II starting it.

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  He loaned all this, gave all this weapon to Franco,

[<a id="00-07-13">00:07:13</a>]  and Franco was using it on his citizens, right?

[<a id="00-07-16">00:07:16</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-07-17">00:07:17</a>]  - So though, I think the Nazis saw like,

[<a id="00-07-20">00:07:20</a>]  okay, that really worked, that didn't work.

[<a id="00-07-22">00:07:22</a>]  You know, they were kind of like, so.

[<a id="00-07-23">00:07:23</a>]  - Fuck.

[<a id="00-07-24">00:07:24</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-07-25">00:07:25</a>]  - So, when I'm doing my show,

[<a id="00-07-28">00:07:28</a>]  like, I was thinking like the way,

[<a id="00-07-30">00:07:30</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-07-32">00:07:32</a>]  I'm not trying to be, you know what I'm trying to say here?

[<a id="00-07-33">00:07:33</a>]  - I know what you're trying to say, but.

[<a id="00-07-35">00:07:35</a>]  - Before you do in a real big market like the USA,

[<a id="00-07-39">00:07:39</a>]  why don't I act like a Nazi?

[<a id="00-07-42">00:07:42</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-07-43">00:07:43</a>]  - And bring it to Scotland.

[<a id="00-07-44">00:07:44</a>]  - Dropping a bunch of Spanish people, right?

[<a id="00-07-46">00:07:46</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-07-47">00:07:47</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-07-49">00:07:49</a>]  Yeah, the example makes perfect sense.

[<a id="00-07-52">00:07:52</a>]  - What I was talking about during my show,

[<a id="00-07-57">00:07:57</a>]  prior to working for one of the porn production company,

[<a id="00-08-02">00:08:02</a>]  I worked at the retail shop, right?

[<a id="00-08-04">00:08:04</a>]  Porn shop in Seattle in the late '90s.

[<a id="00-08-07">00:08:07</a>]  And I was always worried like,

[<a id="00-08-08">00:08:08</a>]  certain customer asking for certain things.

[<a id="00-08-10">00:08:10</a>]  Obviously--

[<a id="00-08-11">00:08:11</a>]  - What was the scary part?

[<a id="00-08-14">00:08:14</a>]  What would they ask for?

[<a id="00-08-16">00:08:16</a>]  - Well, I mean, I was preparing myself

[<a id="00-08-19">00:08:19</a>]  if they ever asked movie with underage kids or something.

[<a id="00-08-22">00:08:22</a>]  - Oh, fuck, yeah, all right.

[<a id="00-08-23">00:08:23</a>]  - Right, so obviously we don't have that

[<a id="00-08-25">00:08:25</a>]  because I don't sell my private collection at the store.

[<a id="00-08-29">00:08:29</a>]  - Fuck's sake.

[<a id="00-08-30">00:08:30</a>]  - I'm joking.

[<a id="00-08-31">00:08:31</a>]  But I was sure somebody was gonna ask

[<a id="00-08-35">00:08:35</a>]  like a rape fantasy porno,

[<a id="00-08-37">00:08:37</a>]  and I was kind of preparing myself for that.

[<a id="00-08-39">00:08:39</a>]  And it did happen.

[<a id="00-08-41">00:08:41</a>]  But it was surprising who were asking for it.

[<a id="00-08-43">00:08:43</a>]  It was always, always women asking for it.

[<a id="00-08-46">00:08:46</a>]  So the room get quiet, right?

[<a id="00-08-49">00:08:49</a>]  And obviously if you're a woman,

[<a id="00-08-51">00:08:51</a>]  I'm not talking about all women,

[<a id="00-08-52">00:08:52</a>]  but some women do have that.

[<a id="00-08-54">00:08:54</a>]  So how does a woman who have rape fantasy

[<a id="00-08-57">00:08:57</a>]  expressing interest in it,

[<a id="00-09-01">00:09:01</a>]  want to have that fantasy without endangering herself?

[<a id="00-09-03">00:09:03</a>]  You can't go public and say,

[<a id="00-09-04">00:09:04</a>]  "I like rape fantasy."

[<a id="00-09-05">00:09:05</a>]  They're gonna get raped, right?

[<a id="00-09-07">00:09:07</a>]  So what they do is,

[<a id="00-09-09">00:09:09</a>]  and the room get quiet when I say that.

[<a id="00-09-10">00:09:10</a>]  Men already feel a little uncomfortable in the room

[<a id="00-09-12">00:09:12</a>]  because I'm saying this, right?

[<a id="00-09-15">00:09:15</a>]  And I explained to them women fulfill their rape fantasy

[<a id="00-09-19">00:09:19</a>]  by watching, reading, listening to vampire stories.

[<a id="00-09-24">00:09:24</a>]  Because if you take the vampire story,

[<a id="00-09-27">00:09:27</a>]  if you take the word vampire and Dracula,

[<a id="00-09-28">00:09:28</a>]  what do they do?

[<a id="00-09-29">00:09:29</a>]  They literally fly into middle of night women's bedroom.

[<a id="00-09-33">00:09:33</a>]  They use the word ravish her,

[<a id="00-09-34">00:09:34</a>]  like rip her clothes and she's seduced by it, right?

[<a id="00-09-37">00:09:37</a>]  The room get quiet.

[<a id="00-09-38">00:09:38</a>]  Nobody's getting angry.

[<a id="00-09-40">00:09:40</a>]  And there's a psychological reasons why women

[<a id="00-09-43">00:09:43</a>]  are into rape fantasy and the right,

[<a id="00-09-47">00:09:47</a>]  why they like Dracula,

[<a id="00-09-48">00:09:48</a>]  like Robert Pattinson's "The Twilight Series."

[<a id="00-09-53">00:09:53</a>]  There's a lot of psychological cues.

[<a id="00-09-56">00:09:56</a>]  Like why do women like vampires?

[<a id="00-09-58">00:09:58</a>]  One, if you see Robert Pattinson,

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  he's a tall guy, he's pretty, good looking.

[<a id="00-10-04">00:10:04</a>]  Nothing flatters women like being with a guy.

[<a id="00-10-07">00:10:07</a>]  So every time he walks with Bella into high school,

[<a id="00-10-10">00:10:10</a>]  all the women stare at him.

[<a id="00-10-12">00:10:12</a>]  So Bella had all the women's approval

[<a id="00-10-15">00:10:15</a>]  and you wanna be with a guy where everyone wants him.

[<a id="00-10-18">00:10:18</a>]  He's tall, good looking.

[<a id="00-10-20">00:10:20</a>]  He's eight to 10 times stronger than regular human beings.

[<a id="00-10-23">00:10:23</a>]  And because he is 200 years old,

[<a id="00-10-26">00:10:26</a>]  he is 17 year old Adonis with confidence in men

[<a id="00-10-29">00:10:29</a>]  been around for 200 years.

[<a id="00-10-30">00:10:30</a>]  So you have all this psychological cues

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  that make him very, very attractive.

[<a id="00-10-35">00:10:35</a>]  - And that's why when you see magazine book covers

[<a id="00-10-39">00:10:39</a>]  where you see a vampire grabbing a woman,

[<a id="00-10-43">00:10:43</a>]  see monster grabbing a woman,

[<a id="00-10-45">00:10:45</a>]  werewolf grabbing women,

[<a id="00-10-47">00:10:47</a>]  it's just that these things are not real.

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  - Yet this aggressive sexual energy

[<a id="00-10-53">00:10:53</a>]  is something that women attract.

[<a id="00-10-56">00:10:56</a>]  Women don't like weak men,

[<a id="00-10-58">00:10:58</a>]  understandably because they can't protect them.

[<a id="00-11-01">00:11:01</a>]  So if you give all this psychological cues

[<a id="00-11-04">00:11:04</a>]  why he was so attractive

[<a id="00-11-07">00:11:07</a>]  and then when women have this kind of aggressive,

[<a id="00-11-09">00:11:09</a>]  some great fantasy,

[<a id="00-11-11">00:11:11</a>]  when you explain it,

[<a id="00-11-12">00:11:12</a>]  and the first time I was able to do it correctly,

[<a id="00-11-14">00:11:14</a>]  you know what shocked me was,

[<a id="00-11-15">00:11:15</a>]  I thought they're gonna get mad.

[<a id="00-11-17">00:11:17</a>]  Every women, when I did it correctly,

[<a id="00-11-20">00:11:20</a>]  halfway through the show were nodding their heads.

[<a id="00-11-22">00:11:22</a>]  I didn't-

[<a id="00-11-23">00:11:23</a>]  - They were nodding?

[<a id="00-11-24">00:11:24</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-11-27">00:11:27</a>]  - So did I know that going into the show,

[<a id="00-11-30">00:11:30</a>]  talking about, and believe me,

[<a id="00-11-31">00:11:31</a>]  that's one of many weird things about,

[<a id="00-11-33">00:11:33</a>]  I experienced and learned in business,

[<a id="00-11-36">00:11:36</a>]  and 20 plus years of dealing with whole fame perverts,

[<a id="00-11-40">00:11:40</a>]  directors, performers, fans,

[<a id="00-11-43">00:11:43</a>]  and people writing fan letters from prison.

[<a id="00-11-46">00:11:46</a>]  This is like all those years of living in LA,

[<a id="00-11-48">00:11:48</a>]  I kind of condense it like a 55 minute show,

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  and I was sharing with them.

[<a id="00-11-54">00:11:54</a>]  So what was interesting for me was,

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  a lot of time guys show up

[<a id="00-11-58">00:11:58</a>]  because they've heard me talk to girls on podcast,

[<a id="00-12-00">00:12:00</a>]  and Tom even said,

[<a id="00-12-02">00:12:02</a>]  come check out at Yoshi's in Scotland.

[<a id="00-12-04">00:12:04</a>]  But what I was surprised by,

[<a id="00-12-06">00:12:06</a>]  and my fans like their wife and girlfriend,

[<a id="00-12-11">00:12:11</a>]  they were kind of surprised.

[<a id="00-12-13">00:12:13</a>]  There was like, that was a really funny show,

[<a id="00-12-15">00:12:15</a>]  but they always say like,

[<a id="00-12-16">00:12:16</a>]  I was kind of shocked I actually learned stuff tonight.

[<a id="00-12-19">00:12:19</a>]  I wasn't really educating,

[<a id="00-12-22">00:12:22</a>]  and they said that was really, really funny.

[<a id="00-12-23">00:12:23</a>]  - But you're also opening a window to something-

[<a id="00-12-26">00:12:26</a>]  - That they're not really familiar with.

[<a id="00-12-27">00:12:27</a>]  - They're not familiar with at all.

[<a id="00-12-29">00:12:29</a>]  And it is something that's slightly verboten, you know?

[<a id="00-12-32">00:12:32</a>]  Like there is, despite the fact that porn has become

[<a id="00-12-37">00:12:37</a>]  something that's probably in everyone's mind,

[<a id="00-12-42">00:12:42</a>]  like no one has to look for porn anymore.

[<a id="00-12-45">00:12:45</a>]  Porn is wherever you need it.

[<a id="00-12-47">00:12:47</a>]  But the industry behind it,

[<a id="00-12-51">00:12:51</a>]  and that there are people behind it,

[<a id="00-12-53">00:12:53</a>]  like it's easy to objectify whatever you want.

[<a id="00-12-56">00:12:56</a>]  But to realize that is first of all, a performance.

[<a id="00-12-59">00:12:59</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-13-00">00:13:00</a>]  - And secondly, these are people with all their flaws.

[<a id="00-13-04">00:13:04</a>]  That's something that a normal citizen,

[<a id="00-13-08">00:13:08</a>]  like someone that's not exposed to that,

[<a id="00-13-10">00:13:10</a>]  that has any experience with.

[<a id="00-13-12">00:13:12</a>]  - Yeah, and I think that wasn't the reason why I got in.

[<a id="00-13-16">00:13:16</a>]  I got in because I had several friends.

[<a id="00-13-20">00:13:20</a>]  They were telling me how much money

[<a id="00-13-21">00:13:21</a>]  they were making in that business.

[<a id="00-13-23">00:13:23</a>]  - For you, sure.

[<a id="00-13-24">00:13:24</a>]  - And I want to support my family.

[<a id="00-13-27">00:13:27</a>]  I went in for reason A,

[<a id="00-13-29">00:13:29</a>]  but I got out with reason B.

[<a id="00-13-31">00:13:31</a>]  - Yes, so it gave you something different.

[<a id="00-13-34">00:13:34</a>]  It taught you something about the people

[<a id="00-13-36">00:13:36</a>]  that are involved in this.

[<a id="00-13-37">00:13:37</a>]  - And most civilians who's never worked in that business

[<a id="00-13-42">00:13:42</a>]  watch Pornhub, they watch "Few Minute,"

[<a id="00-13-44">00:13:44</a>]  they pick the spot they want to masturbate

[<a id="00-13-45">00:13:45</a>]  and they're done with.

[<a id="00-13-46">00:13:46</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="00-13-47">00:13:47</a>]  - Problem is, that's not something I could do

[<a id="00-13-48">00:13:48</a>]  when you're working.

[<a id="00-13-49">00:13:49</a>]  I literally have to, I literally, I can't stop.

[<a id="00-13-52">00:13:52</a>]  I have to work on it, I have to watch the whole thing.

[<a id="00-13-55">00:13:55</a>]  - Shit.

[<a id="00-13-56">00:13:56</a>]  - And I think what happened was.

[<a id="00-13-59">00:13:59</a>]  - Sorry, did you go into work usually

[<a id="00-14-03">00:14:03</a>]  in the morning, balls empty,

[<a id="00-14-04">00:14:04</a>]  to make sure that you can actually focus on everything?

[<a id="00-14-07">00:14:07</a>]  - I was just like, oh no, I gotta work on this.

[<a id="00-14-12">00:14:12</a>]  I've gotta work on this.

[<a id="00-14-14">00:14:14</a>]  I wasn't having a problem with this movie like before.

[<a id="00-14-20">00:14:20</a>]  You know, there was a movie,

[<a id="00-14-23">00:14:23</a>]  I don't have the title of the movie, right?

[<a id="00-14-27">00:14:27</a>]  It's a documentary network.

[<a id="00-14-28">00:14:28</a>]  I don't know if they still have it.

[<a id="00-14-29">00:14:29</a>]  But it was something--

[<a id="00-14-30">00:14:30</a>]  - When porn ends?

[<a id="00-14-31">00:14:31</a>]  - No, no, it was like my best friend octopus

[<a id="00-14-33">00:14:33</a>]  or something like that.

[<a id="00-14-34">00:14:34</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  - And it's about this South African guy

[<a id="00-14-37">00:14:37</a>]  used to swim into this cold water of South Africa.

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  Eventually befriended this octopus, right?

[<a id="00-14-42">00:14:42</a>]  - Wow, okay.

[<a id="00-14-43">00:14:43</a>]  - And he said something really interesting

[<a id="00-14-44">00:14:44</a>]  because from the first day when he went,

[<a id="00-14-47">00:14:47</a>]  he was so cold, he could only stay for a few minutes,

[<a id="00-14-49">00:14:49</a>]  he'd have to get out.

[<a id="00-14-50">00:14:50</a>]  But when he started going every single day,

[<a id="00-14-52">00:14:52</a>]  when he go in, the first couple of days,

[<a id="00-14-54">00:14:54</a>]  first couple of weeks, it's so murky,

[<a id="00-14-56">00:14:56</a>]  and there's a lot of seaweed,

[<a id="00-14-57">00:14:57</a>]  you don't really see anything.

[<a id="00-14-58">00:14:58</a>]  But he said something really,

[<a id="00-14-59">00:14:59</a>]  after a while, when you do it every single day,

[<a id="00-15-02">00:15:02</a>]  and you're getting acclimated,

[<a id="00-15-03">00:15:03</a>]  not just your body getting used to the temperature,

[<a id="00-15-06">00:15:06</a>]  your vision acclimated, you're sensing,

[<a id="00-15-09">00:15:09</a>]  after a while he realized all these eyes are looking at him.

[<a id="00-15-13">00:15:13</a>]  He didn't notice all the creatures in the water,

[<a id="00-15-15">00:15:15</a>]  they were hiding behind the coral reefs,

[<a id="00-15-16">00:15:16</a>]  they were hiding behind seaweed.

[<a id="00-15-18">00:15:18</a>]  You know, like the more you spend time,

[<a id="00-15-20">00:15:20</a>]  you notice all these animals are kinda looking at him,

[<a id="00-15-23">00:15:23</a>]  and then they got used to him, right?

[<a id="00-15-24">00:15:24</a>]  When you start watching so much porn at the level I did,

[<a id="00-15-29">00:15:29</a>]  you started noticing things that other people

[<a id="00-15-32">00:15:32</a>]  really don't pay attention to.

[<a id="00-15-34">00:15:34</a>]  - For example?

[<a id="00-15-35">00:15:35</a>]  - Well, like your body was here, he was Brazilian,

[<a id="00-15-40">00:15:40</a>]  and I'm sure Brazilian people, you know,

[<a id="00-15-42">00:15:42</a>]  they're really good at dancing,

[<a id="00-15-43">00:15:43</a>]  and they know, I mean, 'cause a couple of them told me,

[<a id="00-15-46">00:15:46</a>]  really interesting, like,

[<a id="00-15-48">00:15:48</a>]  oh, when this person danced this way,

[<a id="00-15-50">00:15:50</a>]  it told me this kind of personality.

[<a id="00-15-52">00:15:52</a>]  And to me, the way people fuck,

[<a id="00-15-54">00:15:54</a>]  it tells me their personality kind of thing.

[<a id="00-15-55">00:15:55</a>]  - Oh, fuck, really?

[<a id="00-15-57">00:15:57</a>]  - Yeah, but two, I think when you have to watch real time

[<a id="00-16-02">00:16:02</a>]  the whole movie, like if you see naked people all the time

[<a id="00-16-07">00:16:07</a>]  in your room, they're by sex.

[<a id="00-16-09">00:16:09</a>]  - Desensitized.

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  - I don't even notice anymore.

[<a id="00-16-11">00:16:11</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-16-13">00:16:13</a>]  - You know, but I used to live in Tacoma, Washington.

[<a id="00-16-16">00:16:16</a>]  - Did you walk out of your house bullets naked

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  because you've forgotten, like?

[<a id="00-16-19">00:16:19</a>]  - No, no, it's not like that.

[<a id="00-16-21">00:16:21</a>]  But Tacoma, Washington, they have a paper mill,

[<a id="00-16-23">00:16:23</a>]  so if you're from there,

[<a id="00-16-24">00:16:24</a>]  you don't even notice the smell anywhere.

[<a id="00-16-27">00:16:27</a>]  But I was away for like 20 years,

[<a id="00-16-30">00:16:30</a>]  so when I went back from California,

[<a id="00-16-32">00:16:32</a>]  a few years later--

[<a id="00-16-33">00:16:33</a>]  - You smell it.

[<a id="00-16-34">00:16:34</a>]  - You smell it, and when you work in sex business,

[<a id="00-16-38">00:16:38</a>]  after a while, you don't even notice it.

[<a id="00-16-41">00:16:41</a>]  The most interesting thing,

[<a id="00-16-43">00:16:43</a>]  just like this new movie by Sean Baker, "Anora,"

[<a id="00-16-46">00:16:46</a>]  it's the main character is a stripper,

[<a id="00-16-48">00:16:48</a>]  and she's always naked or whatever.

[<a id="00-16-50">00:16:50</a>]  In my opinion, I don't wanna tell you

[<a id="00-16-51">00:16:51</a>]  exactly what happened until the end of it,

[<a id="00-16-53">00:16:53</a>]  but she was finally really naked at the end of the movie.

[<a id="00-16-57">00:16:57</a>]  When I'm dealing with porn people,

[<a id="00-16-59">00:16:59</a>]  their job is to be naked, perform sex,

[<a id="00-17-04">00:17:04</a>]  show them what they're capable of doing with their body.

[<a id="00-17-08">00:17:08</a>]  But when I watched the behind the scene,

[<a id="00-17-11">00:17:11</a>]  and this is something my stupid friend Aiden,

[<a id="00-17-14">00:17:14</a>]  who used to do movies with one of the greatest

[<a id="00-17-16">00:17:16</a>]  performer, Bella Donna, he's still directing movies,

[<a id="00-17-19">00:17:19</a>]  but he's done this behind the scenes

[<a id="00-17-21">00:17:21</a>]  where he's literally sitting with porn girls

[<a id="00-17-23">00:17:23</a>]  after the scene, just talking to them.

[<a id="00-17-26">00:17:26</a>]  And of course, in the beginning,

[<a id="00-17-27">00:17:27</a>]  a lot of the girls are porny, acting like a porn star,

[<a id="00-17-30">00:17:30</a>]  but when you talk to somebody for 45 minutes,

[<a id="00-17-32">00:17:32</a>]  almost like Joe Rogan's school of interviewing,

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  you kind of drop whatever facade you have.

[<a id="00-17-38">00:17:38</a>]  - Right, okay, so the real person comes out.

[<a id="00-17-42">00:17:42</a>]  And to me, because I was part of that world for so long,

[<a id="00-17-46">00:17:46</a>]  I enjoyed that part the most,

[<a id="00-17-49">00:17:49</a>]  when somebody is emotionally naked, you know?

[<a id="00-17-52">00:17:52</a>]  I went to that whole sex tourism and working sex business.

[<a id="00-17-56">00:17:56</a>]  It really doesn't mean anything.

[<a id="00-17-58">00:17:58</a>]  And I've seen, it's not that I had sex

[<a id="00-17-59">00:17:59</a>]  with a lot of them or anything like that.

[<a id="00-18-01">00:18:01</a>]  I've seen so many beautiful women naked in front of me,

[<a id="00-18-03">00:18:03</a>]  but eventually it becomes like work, you know?

[<a id="00-18-06">00:18:06</a>]  - Of course.

[<a id="00-18-07">00:18:07</a>]  - And I think the biggest problem is,

[<a id="00-18-09">00:18:09</a>]  if you make work out of anything,

[<a id="00-18-11">00:18:11</a>]  it will kill any factors you had that.

[<a id="00-18-13">00:18:13</a>]  - Oh my God, it's completely gone.

[<a id="00-18-14">00:18:14</a>]  When you have to rock up with your Starbucks coffee

[<a id="00-18-18">00:18:18</a>]  in the morning, it goes like,

[<a id="00-18-19">00:18:19</a>]  all right, we did that blowjob again.

[<a id="00-18-21">00:18:21</a>]  It's, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-18-22">00:18:22</a>]  It's just another day at the office.

[<a id="00-18-25">00:18:25</a>]  - Yeah, and living in Los Angeles, you know, I think,

[<a id="00-18-28">00:18:28</a>]  well, especially if you live in that area,

[<a id="00-18-33">00:18:33</a>]  this is why they call it the Golden Triangle.

[<a id="00-18-35">00:18:35</a>]  - The Valley?

[<a id="00-18-36">00:18:36</a>]  - No, well, the Golden Triangle is LA, San Diego, and Vegas.

[<a id="00-18-40">00:18:40</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-18-40">00:18:40</a>]  - San Diego, because once a year they have Comic Con,

[<a id="00-18-43">00:18:43</a>]  where all the comic book movies and all the anime,

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  there's such a big fantasy festival,

[<a id="00-18-50">00:18:50</a>]  and there's a lot of fantasy shit in Vegas,

[<a id="00-18-52">00:18:52</a>]  and of course, LA.

[<a id="00-18-54">00:18:54</a>]  - Fantasy's my number one.

[<a id="00-18-55">00:18:55</a>]  - Yeah, so, you know, about 20 years,

[<a id="00-18-57">00:18:57</a>]  I was living in that kind of environment for a long time.

[<a id="00-18-59">00:18:59</a>]  And when you go to LA, you have the Major League,

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  which is Hollywood, but point is like Minor League,

[<a id="00-19-04">00:19:04</a>]  fantasy shit above LA, you know?

[<a id="00-19-07">00:19:07</a>]  So I was always bombarded by that world,

[<a id="00-19-12">00:19:12</a>]  of the fantasy world, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-19-14">00:19:14</a>]  So like, when Jim Norris started doing "Sniper Show"

[<a id="00-19-16">00:19:16</a>]  in 2005, '06, '07, he invited me.

[<a id="00-19-19">00:19:19</a>]  So when I went with them for the first couple of times,

[<a id="00-19-23">00:19:23</a>]  I became friends with the segment producers.

[<a id="00-19-25">00:19:25</a>]  And once they found out I'd written porn,

[<a id="00-19-28">00:19:28</a>]  they called me every time, "Hey, you know, Seth Robinson,

[<a id="00-19-30">00:19:30</a>]  "you mentioned porn, 'cause you might bring box of porn."

[<a id="00-19-32">00:19:32</a>]  So what happened was, I ended up on "Sniper Show"

[<a id="00-19-35">00:19:35</a>]  delivering porn, you know?

[<a id="00-19-37">00:19:37</a>]  - Hand delivered.

[<a id="00-19-38">00:19:38</a>]  Wait, so yeah, this is kind of like pre-internet.

[<a id="00-19-41">00:19:41</a>]  - Yeah, so those DVDs, they're getting free.

[<a id="00-19-44">00:19:44</a>]  And also, they don't wanna have

[<a id="00-19-45">00:19:45</a>]  an internet history looking porn.

[<a id="00-19-47">00:19:47</a>]  So DVDs really give them privacy,

[<a id="00-19-49">00:19:49</a>]  and that give them free DVD.

[<a id="00-19-51">00:19:51</a>]  And the fact that they also enjoy the fact

[<a id="00-19-53">00:19:53</a>]  that it was getting from somebody who worked in the business.

[<a id="00-19-56">00:19:56</a>]  But also, I'm a stand-up comic,

[<a id="00-19-58">00:19:58</a>]  so there were some leeways, like,

[<a id="00-20-00">00:20:00</a>]  oh, a comic gave it to me, whatever, right?

[<a id="00-20-03">00:20:03</a>]  - To me, this has like the element of Barry,

[<a id="00-20-07">00:20:07</a>]  where he's like the, he's technically the killer.

[<a id="00-20-12">00:20:12</a>]  - You wanna explain the audience,

[<a id="00-20-13">00:20:13</a>]  because maybe they have a show on HBO.

[<a id="00-20-15">00:20:15</a>]  - Barry, Barry's a show on HBO.

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  - Bill Hader.

[<a id="00-20-18">00:20:18</a>]  - Bill Hader, absolutely amazing show.

[<a id="00-20-20">00:20:20</a>]  He's a killer.

[<a id="00-20-22">00:20:22</a>]  - He's serving military.

[<a id="00-20-23">00:20:23</a>]  He hasn't dealt with his post-traumatic PTSD.

[<a id="00-20-26">00:20:26</a>]  Instead of getting therapy, he become assassin.

[<a id="00-20-29">00:20:29</a>]  - Exactly, so he's an assassin for hire,

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  but his cover is he wants to be an actor in Hollywood.

[<a id="00-20-35">00:20:35</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-20-36">00:20:36</a>]  - That's his cover.

[<a id="00-20-37">00:20:37</a>]  - Or using theater to give him a therapy in performance.

[<a id="00-20-41">00:20:41</a>]  - Probably.

[<a id="00-20-42">00:20:42</a>]  But for, what I'm thinking for you is like,

[<a id="00-20-45">00:20:45</a>]  you're the best, technically you're the best dealer.

[<a id="00-20-48">00:20:48</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-49">00:20:49</a>]  - He's like, you're a stand-up comic,

[<a id="00-20-50">00:20:50</a>]  that means you're traveling all the time.

[<a id="00-20-51">00:20:51</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-52">00:20:52</a>]  - You have access through that profession.

[<a id="00-20-55">00:20:55</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-56">00:20:56</a>]  - But you're also the porn handler.

[<a id="00-20-59">00:20:59</a>]  - Oh, you're talking about me?

[<a id="00-21-00">00:21:00</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is what I'm referring to.

[<a id="00-21-02">00:21:02</a>]  It's like, it's kind of like the ideal person

[<a id="00-21-06">00:21:06</a>]  to be like, hey, get this to that person.

[<a id="00-21-08">00:21:08</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-09">00:21:09</a>]  - It's like if the cartels would have caught on to that one,

[<a id="00-21-11">00:21:11</a>]  it would be like, only stealer comedians.

[<a id="00-21-14">00:21:14</a>]  - It's funny 'cause when I got fired in 2012,

[<a id="00-21-17">00:21:17</a>]  and I didn't know what to do, I started traveling a lot.

[<a id="00-21-19">00:21:19</a>]  And when I was, I mean, I'd go anywhere if you invite me.

[<a id="00-21-23">00:21:23</a>]  - Clearly.

[<a id="00-21-25">00:21:25</a>]  - Like most people are not like that.

[<a id="00-21-25">00:21:25</a>]  So when my friend Sonny invited me to Afghanistan,

[<a id="00-21-27">00:21:27</a>]  of course I went in 2012.

[<a id="00-21-29">00:21:29</a>]  And when I went, it doesn't matter when you tell the truth,

[<a id="00-21-32">00:21:32</a>]  they're just not gonna believe it.

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  So like, what do you do?

[<a id="00-21-34">00:21:34</a>]  Like, well, I'm a comic, but I also used to work in porn.

[<a id="00-21-39">00:21:39</a>]  But I tried to make money by sacrificing my body

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  for medical testing.

[<a id="00-21-46">00:21:46</a>]  And like, when you tell that to people,

[<a id="00-21-47">00:21:47</a>]  like they just think, no, you're a spy.

[<a id="00-21-49">00:21:49</a>]  You know that?

[<a id="00-21-50">00:21:50</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-21-51">00:21:51</a>]  - Because spies seem more believable than.

[<a id="00-21-54">00:21:54</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-54">00:21:54</a>]  - You work in porn, but you do comedy,

[<a id="00-21-56">00:21:56</a>]  but you don't make enough money to be funny.

[<a id="00-21-57">00:21:57</a>]  - So none of those jobs make sense in the first place.

[<a id="00-22-01">00:22:01</a>]  But let's go back a little bit.

[<a id="00-22-03">00:22:03</a>]  Because when you were, we talked about Edinburgh,

[<a id="00-22-08">00:22:08</a>]  the show that you brought to Edinburgh

[<a id="00-22-11">00:22:11</a>]  is basically a condensation of the years

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  that you lived in LA and in these industries.

[<a id="00-22-18">00:22:18</a>]  - But I also talk about,

[<a id="00-22-21">00:22:21</a>]  something happened to me when I was a kid

[<a id="00-22-24">00:22:24</a>]  kind of led me to that path.

[<a id="00-22-26">00:22:26</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-22-26">00:22:26</a>]  - And I think everything seemed a little accidental,

[<a id="00-22-29">00:22:29</a>]  but looking back, it made sense that I went

[<a id="00-22-32">00:22:32</a>]  that direction in life, you know?

[<a id="00-22-35">00:22:35</a>]  - When did comedy start?

[<a id="00-22-38">00:22:38</a>]  - '90s, mid '90s.

[<a id="00-22-39">00:22:39</a>]  - Mid '90s?

[<a id="00-22-40">00:22:40</a>]  - Well, I mean, I wasn't really interested in comedy.

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  I was, I think I was dealing with problems.

[<a id="00-22-48">00:22:48</a>]  I was doing more public speaking, like Toastmasters.

[<a id="00-22-51">00:22:51</a>]  - Oh, right.

[<a id="00-22-52">00:22:52</a>]  - But they don't want to hear the things I was saying.

[<a id="00-22-53">00:22:53</a>]  They get mad at you, you know?

[<a id="00-22-54">00:22:54</a>]  So I just went anywhere, like, said some really odd things.

[<a id="00-22-58">00:22:58</a>]  And that's how it already started then.

[<a id="00-23-03">00:23:03</a>]  Well, I went to school for Evergreen State College,

[<a id="00-23-07">00:23:07</a>]  where the creators of "Samsung" went,

[<a id="00-23-09">00:23:09</a>]  and it's a college where you don't get grades,

[<a id="00-23-13">00:23:13</a>]  and it's a very controversial grade,

[<a id="00-23-14">00:23:14</a>]  because many people think they're run

[<a id="00-23-16">00:23:16</a>]  by Marxistic communists.

[<a id="00-23-18">00:23:18</a>]  - Wait, is that in San Francisco?

[<a id="00-23-19">00:23:19</a>]  - No, this is Olympia, Washington.

[<a id="00-23-21">00:23:21</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-23-22">00:23:22</a>]  - In fact, they had an event like 10 years ago,

[<a id="00-23-24">00:23:24</a>]  where, well, it's been the last seven, eight years,

[<a id="00-23-27">00:23:27</a>]  a day without a white people.

[<a id="00-23-28">00:23:28</a>]  And one of the professors say, no, that's racist.

[<a id="00-23-31">00:23:31</a>]  You can't do that.

[<a id="00-23-32">00:23:32</a>]  It's like, I showed up anyway.

[<a id="00-23-34">00:23:34</a>]  That's Eric Weinstein.

[<a id="00-23-35">00:23:35</a>]  - Yes, yes, okay.

[<a id="00-23-38">00:23:38</a>]  - He was there after I left.

[<a id="00-23-39">00:23:39</a>]  And--

[<a id="00-23-43">00:23:43</a>]  - You're nearly the same age.

[<a id="00-23-45">00:23:45</a>]  - Yeah, so it wasn't that I was interested in comedy.

[<a id="00-23-49">00:23:49</a>]  I was fine in the avenue where I was dealing

[<a id="00-23-52">00:23:52</a>]  with some personal issues,

[<a id="00-23-53">00:23:53</a>]  and I just wanted to stand up being horrible.

[<a id="00-23-55">00:23:55</a>]  It doesn't have to be funny.

[<a id="00-23-57">00:23:57</a>]  - Right, so just wanted to do it like that.

[<a id="00-23-58">00:23:58</a>]  - But you can't say stuff like that on stage.

[<a id="00-24-01">00:24:01</a>]  So, like you mentioned, "Nightline" is like,

[<a id="00-24-02">00:24:02</a>]  okay, maybe just stand up.

[<a id="00-24-06">00:24:06</a>]  And I wasn't interested in Korea and things like that,

[<a id="00-24-09">00:24:09</a>]  'cause I think living in Pacific Northwest,

[<a id="00-24-12">00:24:12</a>]  you don't, these kids are so savvy these days,

[<a id="00-24-14">00:24:14</a>]  but what kind of person thinks going to stand up

[<a id="00-24-16">00:24:16</a>]  you could have made Korea out of it?

[<a id="00-24-17">00:24:17</a>]  That's just crazy.

[<a id="00-24-18">00:24:18</a>]  I was looking for a place just,

[<a id="00-24-20">00:24:20</a>]  'cause once you graduate from college and high school,

[<a id="00-24-23">00:24:23</a>]  you don't really have a bunch of young people hang out,

[<a id="00-24-25">00:24:25</a>]  'cause I'm so anti-social and not personable.

[<a id="00-24-27">00:24:27</a>]  So I don't have anybody to harass them

[<a id="00-24-31">00:24:31</a>]  by saying something bad.

[<a id="00-24-32">00:24:32</a>]  - All right.

[<a id="00-24-33">00:24:33</a>]  - That's the only reason I was doing it.

[<a id="00-24-36">00:24:36</a>]  But I noticed that because I was such an oddball,

[<a id="00-24-40">00:24:40</a>]  I mean, there's plenty of big name comedians

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  are mad at me because--

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  - Why use past tense?

[<a id="00-24-44">00:24:44</a>]  - What?

[<a id="00-24-45">00:24:45</a>]  - Why use a past tense? - Oh yeah, that's true.

[<a id="00-24-48">00:24:48</a>]  My problem is sometimes I did something,

[<a id="00-24-49">00:24:49</a>]  I wasn't trying to deliberately hurt somebody

[<a id="00-24-52">00:24:52</a>]  or make them angry.

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  Sometimes I did something,

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  I didn't even know they were angry with me for a long time,

[<a id="00-24-56">00:24:56</a>]  'cause I didn't, they don't say anything, you know?

[<a id="00-24-58">00:24:58</a>]  So that's partly a problem,

[<a id="00-25-03">00:25:03</a>]  but I think 2012, I lost my job,

[<a id="00-25-08">00:25:08</a>]  and you could hear more about it in a podcast

[<a id="00-25-12">00:25:12</a>]  called "Last Day of August" by Ron Johnson.

[<a id="00-25-16">00:25:16</a>]  Wait, John, I always forget his name.

[<a id="00-25-18">00:25:18</a>]  John Ronson, very famous writer and podcaster,

[<a id="00-25-22">00:25:22</a>]  he wrote a book called "Psychopath Test."

[<a id="00-25-24">00:25:24</a>]  So that podcast in 2019 was top five,

[<a id="00-25-27">00:25:27</a>]  the top 10 podcast of the year.

[<a id="00-25-29">00:25:29</a>]  So he interviewed me because something sad happened

[<a id="00-25-31">00:25:31</a>]  in that pod the last of August.

[<a id="00-25-33">00:25:33</a>]  But I think I got fired from my work.

[<a id="00-25-36">00:25:36</a>]  I had to make a decision.

[<a id="00-25-40">00:25:40</a>]  I got an offer from another big porn company,

[<a id="00-25-42">00:25:42</a>]  but I made a decision.

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  Do I really want to spend the other 10, 15 years

[<a id="00-25-46">00:25:46</a>]  with another porn company?

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  Or do I want to take this opportunity

[<a id="00-25-50">00:25:50</a>]  to do something I want to do?

[<a id="00-25-51">00:25:51</a>]  'Cause I always want to travel,

[<a id="00-25-53">00:25:53</a>]  and it's a really difficult decision,

[<a id="00-25-55">00:25:55</a>]  but I finally made a decision.

[<a id="00-25-56">00:25:56</a>]  I know what happened to my dad,

[<a id="00-25-58">00:25:58</a>]  he lived a pretty miserable life.

[<a id="00-26-00">00:26:00</a>]  He wanted to go all kinds of places that he wanted to go,

[<a id="00-26-01">00:26:01</a>]  he never did it.

[<a id="00-26-03">00:26:03</a>]  So I made a decision that I want to travel.

[<a id="00-26-07">00:26:07</a>]  - Right, but you were already doing a standup

[<a id="00-26-11">00:26:11</a>]  during that time, like you were already working

[<a id="00-26-14">00:26:14</a>]  as a standup, so you said--

[<a id="00-26-15">00:26:15</a>]  - I mean, working's a stretch because, sure,

[<a id="00-26-19">00:26:19</a>]  when I was opening for Jim Norton,

[<a id="00-26-21">00:26:21</a>]  David Teller, Russell Peters,

[<a id="00-26-23">00:26:23</a>]  they're not gonna make a living.

[<a id="00-26-24">00:26:24</a>]  - But when did that start?

[<a id="00-26-25">00:26:25</a>]  So you said in the '90s, you started comedy in the '90s,

[<a id="00-26-28">00:26:28</a>]  let's go back there for a split second.

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  - I mean, I think I got started getting paid

[<a id="00-26-32">00:26:32</a>]  with a real gig like early 2000.

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  - Early 2000.

[<a id="00-26-36">00:26:36</a>]  - I mean, I was getting paid with like $50 here, $100.

[<a id="00-26-39">00:26:39</a>]  You can't make money with it, you're getting paid.

[<a id="00-26-41">00:26:41</a>]  I at one point considered getting a free beer

[<a id="00-26-44">00:26:44</a>]  at the bar before my sale was payment.

[<a id="00-26-47">00:26:47</a>]  But where did you perform?

[<a id="00-26-50">00:26:50</a>]  What was the first venue that you performed?

[<a id="00-26-53">00:26:53</a>]  - Comedy Underground.

[<a id="00-26-54">00:26:54</a>]  - Comedy Underground?

[<a id="00-26-55">00:26:55</a>]  - Seattle, it's gone now.

[<a id="00-26-56">00:26:56</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-26-57">00:26:57</a>]  - It really is such a sacred place for me

[<a id="00-27-00">00:27:00</a>]  and my comedians when we started.

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  It was such a, I don't think I've had experience

[<a id="00-27-05">00:27:05</a>]  like the anywhere else where it was such a collaborative

[<a id="00-27-09">00:27:09</a>]  and loving situation.

[<a id="00-27-11">00:27:11</a>]  And there was a guy named Carl who ran the open mic.

[<a id="00-27-14">00:27:14</a>]  What an incredible guy.

[<a id="00-27-15">00:27:15</a>]  And that's where I did a show with Mitch Hepberg

[<a id="00-27-17">00:27:17</a>]  and a bunch of other comedians.

[<a id="00-27-21">00:27:21</a>]  Stanhope I saw him for the first time there, hell yes.

[<a id="00-27-24">00:27:24</a>]  But it was such a, but yeah, and you were kind enough

[<a id="00-27-28">00:27:28</a>]  to do the show that was part of and ask.

[<a id="00-27-30">00:27:30</a>]  You flew all the way from Europe and you did it last summer.

[<a id="00-27-33">00:27:33</a>]  - Exactly, but we will get there.

[<a id="00-27-36">00:27:36</a>]  So you were doing?

[<a id="00-27-38">00:27:38</a>]  - Comedy Underground.

[<a id="00-27-39">00:27:39</a>]  - Comedy Underground in Seattle, and that's what,

[<a id="00-27-40">00:27:40</a>]  once a week?

[<a id="00-27-42">00:27:42</a>]  - No, I tried, I mean, they have an open mic.

[<a id="00-27-45">00:27:45</a>]  I think back then, Sunday and Monday,

[<a id="00-27-48">00:27:48</a>]  we try to go all the time.

[<a id="00-27-50">00:27:50</a>]  Carl, to many of us, including like someone like Hepberg,

[<a id="00-27-55">00:27:55</a>]  he really was like Obi-Wan Kenobi of stand-up comedy.

[<a id="00-27-59">00:27:59</a>]  - Oh really?

[<a id="00-28-00">00:28:00</a>]  So he performed in Seattle?

[<a id="00-28-01">00:28:01</a>]  - He was a performer and to tell you how meticulous

[<a id="00-28-05">00:28:05</a>]  and how helpful he is, he has a notebook for a lot,

[<a id="00-28-08">00:28:08</a>]  I think he stopped working there like 10, 12 years ago.

[<a id="00-28-13">00:28:13</a>]  But 25 years that he ran open mic.

[<a id="00-28-15">00:28:15</a>]  - 25 years?

[<a id="00-28-16">00:28:16</a>]  - He have a notebook telling you exactly who went

[<a id="00-28-19">00:28:19</a>]  to that particular Monday and how many comedians went up.

[<a id="00-28-21">00:28:21</a>]  - Hell yes.

[<a id="00-28-22">00:28:22</a>]  - In order, he was like that.

[<a id="00-28-24">00:28:24</a>]  And he was recently interviewed for Mitch Hepberg documentary

[<a id="00-28-28">00:28:28</a>]  and things like that.

[<a id="00-28-28">00:28:28</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-28-29">00:28:29</a>]  - And I really, 'cause since then,

[<a id="00-28-32">00:28:32</a>]  I've been to all the different clubs,

[<a id="00-28-34">00:28:34</a>]  they've never had what Seattle Comedy Underground had.

[<a id="00-28-37">00:28:37</a>]  It was that place, I was so lucky to be a part of that.

[<a id="00-28-41">00:28:41</a>]  - But surrounded by people like that,

[<a id="00-28-43">00:28:43</a>]  that's also, that's kind of like pushing you, right?

[<a id="00-28-45">00:28:45</a>]  Like you go, all right, I wanna write better jokes.

[<a id="00-28-48">00:28:48</a>]  - Well, this is how dumb I am.

[<a id="00-28-49">00:28:49</a>]  When I did show with Mitch and stuff,

[<a id="00-28-52">00:28:52</a>]  and he was very generous with me, you know?

[<a id="00-28-54">00:28:54</a>]  I remember hosting a show with Mitch in Seattle.

[<a id="00-29-01">00:29:01</a>]  And after the show, thanks Mitch, you know,

[<a id="00-29-05">00:29:05</a>]  and his wife Lynn was there.

[<a id="00-29-07">00:29:07</a>]  He's in the back room at the Giggles Comedy Club,

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  which is a competing club in the outside of Seattle.

[<a id="00-29-12">00:29:12</a>]  Oh, he said, "Come here."

[<a id="00-29-13">00:29:13</a>]  And because the owner is so fucking shady,

[<a id="00-29-15">00:29:15</a>]  rest in peace, Terry, he died last year,

[<a id="00-29-17">00:29:17</a>]  early in this year, he paid in cash.

[<a id="00-29-21">00:29:21</a>]  - Of course.

[<a id="00-29-22">00:29:22</a>]  - 'Cause they don't wanna pay tax, whatever.

[<a id="00-29-23">00:29:23</a>]  But you know that thing that you go to amusement,

[<a id="00-29-25">00:29:25</a>]  amusement places where they play arcade?

[<a id="00-29-31">00:29:31</a>]  - Sure, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-29-32">00:29:32</a>]  - You know those things where you put a money,

[<a id="00-29-34">00:29:34</a>]  the thing go, it look like a jump,

[<a id="00-29-37">00:29:37</a>]  and you go, mm, and try to grab.

[<a id="00-29-40">00:29:40</a>]  - Yeah, the claw.

[<a id="00-29-41">00:29:41</a>]  - Yeah, claw.

[<a id="00-29-42">00:29:42</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-29-43">00:29:43</a>]  Man, for teddy bears.

[<a id="00-29-46">00:29:46</a>]  - I never got paid for like professional shows.

[<a id="00-29-48">00:29:48</a>]  Mitch, "Hey, wait, come here."

[<a id="00-29-50">00:29:50</a>]  He just put his hand and piled money like this.

[<a id="00-29-53">00:29:53</a>]  Grab piled money like this and just give it to me.

[<a id="00-29-56">00:29:56</a>]  - Wow.

[<a id="00-29-57">00:29:57</a>]  - See, I'm Asian, I'm cheap.

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  I only pick the dollar bills, you know?

[<a id="00-30-00">00:30:00</a>]  Right, dollar bills.

[<a id="00-30-06">00:30:06</a>]  I only give you the dirty dollar bill.

[<a id="00-30-08">00:30:08</a>]  That crispy one?

[<a id="00-30-10">00:30:10</a>]  Mention, man, was so generous.

[<a id="00-30-12">00:30:12</a>]  He just went, "Ah," you know,

[<a id="00-30-14">00:30:14</a>]  he just grabbed a bunch of money.

[<a id="00-30-15">00:30:15</a>]  "Here, take this."

[<a id="00-30-17">00:30:17</a>]  He just piled money, right?

[<a id="00-30-18">00:30:18</a>]  It was a couple, you know, like,

[<a id="00-30-19">00:30:19</a>]  it's kind of in the early 2000s.

[<a id="00-30-22">00:30:22</a>]  Just piled money like that, right?

[<a id="00-30-24">00:30:24</a>]  I thought he was joking, but he--

[<a id="00-30-26">00:30:26</a>]  - He was genuinely.

[<a id="00-30-28">00:30:28</a>]  - So I thought he was joking and like, "Oh, thanks."

[<a id="00-30-30">00:30:30</a>]  And I thought he's just been grabbing bad.

[<a id="00-30-32">00:30:32</a>]  "Yeah, I'll see you next time, hope to work again."

[<a id="00-30-35">00:30:35</a>]  Just given all that money, it must be a couple hundred bucks.

[<a id="00-30-37">00:30:37</a>]  I never been, I think he was the original Russell Peters

[<a id="00-30-40">00:30:40</a>]  before Russell Peters, you know?

[<a id="00-30-42">00:30:42</a>]  - Before Russell Peters.

[<a id="00-30-44">00:30:44</a>]  So like, but after Seattle, where do you go?

[<a id="00-30-47">00:30:47</a>]  You go to Los Angeles?

[<a id="00-30-49">00:30:49</a>]  - I went to LA because I was having an issue with my family.

[<a id="00-30-54">00:30:54</a>]  I got sick and lived in Washington State.

[<a id="00-30-56">00:30:56</a>]  I saved a little bit of money.

[<a id="00-30-58">00:30:58</a>]  And I think at that point I was working for,

[<a id="00-31-01">00:31:01</a>]  so I ended up working at three different porn shops

[<a id="00-31-03">00:31:03</a>]  from late '90s, Caboo Video, R&R, Adult Toys,

[<a id="00-31-07">00:31:07</a>]  and Larry's Bookstore, you know?

[<a id="00-31-12">00:31:12</a>]  - Larry's Bookstore.

[<a id="00-31-14">00:31:14</a>]  - I think it's Larry's Bookstore.

[<a id="00-31-16">00:31:16</a>]  It's in Tacoma, Lakewood.

[<a id="00-31-18">00:31:18</a>]  - But it's a porn shop, yeah?

[<a id="00-31-19">00:31:19</a>]  - Yeah, so I worked for three different ones, right?

[<a id="00-31-23">00:31:23</a>]  - Larry's Bookstore is the best cover name for a porn shop.

[<a id="00-31-28">00:31:28</a>]  - So I worked with them and I feel like,

[<a id="00-31-31">00:31:31</a>]  I think I learned as much as I can looking at this shop

[<a id="00-31-34">00:31:34</a>]  for like five years, and I was ready to go.

[<a id="00-31-37">00:31:37</a>]  In 2002, I finally traveled overseas.

[<a id="00-31-42">00:31:42</a>]  Until 1995, well, until late '80s and early '90s,

[<a id="00-31-47">00:31:47</a>]  I was illegal alien.

[<a id="00-31-48">00:31:48</a>]  My mother just kidnapped myself and my younger brother

[<a id="00-31-51">00:31:51</a>]  from Japan to USA after my parents got divorced.

[<a id="00-31-54">00:31:54</a>]  I didn't even know they were divorced

[<a id="00-31-55">00:31:55</a>]  until we landed in Hawaii.

[<a id="00-31-57">00:31:57</a>]  And basically, she made me and my younger brother,

[<a id="00-32-01">00:32:01</a>]  we were living with her sister in Washington.

[<a id="00-32-05">00:32:05</a>]  So I didn't know what was going on, you know?

[<a id="00-32-08">00:32:08</a>]  - So you didn't have an American passport?

[<a id="00-32-10">00:32:10</a>]  - I was a legal alien and I didn't have,

[<a id="00-32-13">00:32:13</a>]  I received my citizenship 1995.

[<a id="00-32-17">00:32:17</a>]  - '95, and by that point, you're in the US for how long?

[<a id="00-32-21">00:32:21</a>]  - 15 years, I guess, 14, 15 years.

[<a id="00-32-24">00:32:24</a>]  - Yeah, right, okay.

[<a id="00-32-25">00:32:25</a>]  - And, and...

[<a id="00-32-29">00:32:29</a>]  - So you said in early 2000s, like 2002,

[<a id="00-32-32">00:32:32</a>]  you're traveling abroad for the first time?

[<a id="00-32-35">00:32:35</a>]  - I went to Japan prior to that,

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  but I always wanted to go to Europe.

[<a id="00-32-39">00:32:39</a>]  And my friend D'Amico, who was a manager

[<a id="00-32-43">00:32:43</a>]  at the R&R Hato Toys, was generous with time.

[<a id="00-32-46">00:32:46</a>]  So I was able to travel overseas,

[<a id="00-32-48">00:32:48</a>]  and I realized we live in a bigger world.

[<a id="00-32-51">00:32:51</a>]  I don't want to be just stuck in Seattle, Washington,

[<a id="00-32-55">00:32:55</a>]  for the rest of my life.

[<a id="00-32-56">00:32:56</a>]  So I made a decision to move to LA.

[<a id="00-32-59">00:32:59</a>]  Well...

[<a id="00-33-00">00:33:00</a>]  - Where did you go in Europe?

[<a id="00-33-02">00:33:02</a>]  When or why?

[<a id="00-33-04">00:33:04</a>]  When?

[<a id="00-33-05">00:33:05</a>]  - When, 2002.

[<a id="00-33-08">00:33:08</a>]  - And you went where first?

[<a id="00-33-10">00:33:10</a>]  - But before I tell you,

[<a id="00-33-14">00:33:14</a>]  my original plan was to move to New York City.

[<a id="00-33-16">00:33:16</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-33-19">00:33:19</a>]  - And what happened was...

[<a id="00-33-19">00:33:19</a>]  - For how many reasons, I presume?

[<a id="00-33-21">00:33:21</a>]  - Not really.

[<a id="00-33-25">00:33:25</a>]  - That would be lying.

[<a id="00-33-26">00:33:26</a>]  I just want to get the fuck out of Washington State.

[<a id="00-33-28">00:33:28</a>]  So this is what happened.

[<a id="00-33-29">00:33:29</a>]  Okay, okay.

[<a id="00-33-30">00:33:30</a>]  My uncle and aunt finally have enough money

[<a id="00-33-34">00:33:34</a>]  to start a, take over a new business.

[<a id="00-33-37">00:33:37</a>]  They were doing nail salon for a long time,

[<a id="00-33-38">00:33:38</a>]  but they were able to buy a new location, right?

[<a id="00-33-41">00:33:41</a>]  And that they need a possibility manager working there.

[<a id="00-33-45">00:33:45</a>]  So they signed a deal for a lease,

[<a id="00-33-49">00:33:49</a>]  and they told, hey, you know, we're filing the lease.

[<a id="00-33-50">00:33:50</a>]  Maybe we need a manager or something like that.

[<a id="00-33-53">00:33:53</a>]  - So you were going like, well, I sold porn all my life.

[<a id="00-33-56">00:33:56</a>]  Nail's probably easier?

[<a id="00-33-58">00:33:58</a>]  - No.

[<a id="00-33-59">00:33:59</a>]  They signed the lease on September 10th, 2001.

[<a id="00-34-05">00:34:05</a>]  - Oh, hell yes.

[<a id="00-34-07">00:34:07</a>]  - So they were down in Bleecker Street,

[<a id="00-34-09">00:34:09</a>]  which is lower Manhattan.

[<a id="00-34-10">00:34:10</a>]  So like, September 10th, I was thinking like,

[<a id="00-34-12">00:34:12</a>]  that was Monday, I think.

[<a id="00-34-15">00:34:15</a>]  Yeah, I'm going to New York.

[<a id="00-34-16">00:34:16</a>]  Then of course I get up early morning, September 11th,

[<a id="00-34-21">00:34:21</a>]  and I'm watching CNN, and I'm watching and I'm like,

[<a id="00-34-23">00:34:23</a>]  holy fuck, what movies, the graphic is incredible.

[<a id="00-34-27">00:34:27</a>]  'Cause it says CNN, World Trade Center's on fire.

[<a id="00-34-31">00:34:31</a>]  I just got up, you know, like,

[<a id="00-34-32">00:34:32</a>]  and I don't understand what movies,

[<a id="00-34-35">00:34:35</a>]  I don't understand what's going on.

[<a id="00-34-37">00:34:37</a>]  As I'm watching, the second plane hit the World Trade Center.

[<a id="00-34-41">00:34:41</a>]  So I'm just watching this live, you know?

[<a id="00-34-44">00:34:44</a>]  And only person at the time I knew from New York

[<a id="00-34-47">00:34:47</a>]  was my friend Guy De Silva.

[<a id="00-34-48">00:34:48</a>]  That's his stage name, he's a porn guy.

[<a id="00-34-50">00:34:50</a>]  So I'm talking to him, like,

[<a id="00-34-51">00:34:51</a>]  so on 9/11 I'm talking to my porn buddy,

[<a id="00-34-54">00:34:54</a>]  because I don't know anybody else in New York

[<a id="00-34-58">00:34:58</a>]  except my uncle and aunt and my cousin,

[<a id="00-35-00">00:35:00</a>]  but I called, nobody's answering the phone.

[<a id="00-35-02">00:35:02</a>]  On Friday recently, it was a really difficult day to call.

[<a id="00-35-04">00:35:04</a>]  The telecommunication was all fucked up, you know?

[<a id="00-35-07">00:35:07</a>]  So eventually they said,

[<a id="00-35-10">00:35:10</a>]  my first time in New York was like six or seven days after.

[<a id="00-35-14">00:35:14</a>]  I already bought the ticket, you know?

[<a id="00-35-15">00:35:15</a>]  - So you still went.

[<a id="00-35-16">00:35:16</a>]  - I still went.

[<a id="00-35-17">00:35:17</a>]  What's funny is I was supposed to go September 11th,

[<a id="00-35-21">00:35:21</a>]  but because my coworkers couldn't switch dates,

[<a id="00-35-25">00:35:25</a>]  I went like within six or seven, eight days after the 9/11.

[<a id="00-35-29">00:35:29</a>]  So that was my first trip to New York City.

[<a id="00-35-31">00:35:31</a>]  So as I'm flying over New York City,

[<a id="00-35-35">00:35:35</a>]  we flew over Lower Manhattan.

[<a id="00-35-36">00:35:36</a>]  I could see smoke coming up.

[<a id="00-35-37">00:35:37</a>]  At the same time I'm going like, fuck man,

[<a id="00-35-39">00:35:39</a>]  I thought I was gonna go to New York, you know?

[<a id="00-35-42">00:35:42</a>]  But it's not gonna happen because of that.

[<a id="00-35-44">00:35:44</a>]  - The store was in Lower Manhattan.

[<a id="00-35-46">00:35:46</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-35-47">00:35:47</a>]  - Was supposed to be in Lower Manhattan.

[<a id="00-35-48">00:35:48</a>]  - It was in Lower Manhattan, Glacier Street,

[<a id="00-35-50">00:35:50</a>]  which is not that far from Comedy Cellar.

[<a id="00-35-54">00:35:54</a>]  So I realized like late 2002, early 2003,

[<a id="00-35-59">00:35:59</a>]  oh no, late 2001, early 2002,

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  I guess New York is not option anymore,

[<a id="00-36-08">00:36:08</a>]  so I made a decision to go to LA.

[<a id="00-36-10">00:36:10</a>]  But my original plan was to go to New York.

[<a id="00-36-12">00:36:12</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  - But 9/11 really changed my plan, you know?

[<a id="00-36-15">00:36:15</a>]  - It changed your plans.

[<a id="00-36-18">00:36:18</a>]  - For a lot of people.

[<a id="00-36-19">00:36:19</a>]  - A lot of people.

[<a id="00-36-19">00:36:19</a>]  - So I went and moved to LA for that.

[<a id="00-36-25">00:36:25</a>]  But there's a lot of weird things happened

[<a id="00-36-27">00:36:27</a>]  because I didn't, I think that the convention,

[<a id="00-36-32">00:36:32</a>]  the porn convention I went before I moved to LA,

[<a id="00-36-38">00:36:38</a>]  which was January 2003,

[<a id="00-36-41">00:36:41</a>]  and Evil Angel, my favorite porn company,

[<a id="00-36-45">00:36:45</a>]  had a signing, they were looking for a DVD producer.

[<a id="00-36-48">00:36:48</a>]  Only reason I got that job

[<a id="00-36-50">00:36:50</a>]  is because nobody else applied for it.

[<a id="00-36-52">00:36:52</a>]  I was the only one.

[<a id="00-36-53">00:36:53</a>]  Out of the tens of thousands of people applying,

[<a id="00-36-56">00:36:56</a>]  I'm the only one applying for it.

[<a id="00-36-58">00:36:58</a>]  That's the only reason I got a job.

[<a id="00-36-59">00:36:59</a>]  I have no experience whatsoever.

[<a id="00-37-01">00:37:01</a>]  (laughs)

[<a id="00-37-03">00:37:03</a>]  - Wait, okay, so describe what a DVD producer in porn does.

[<a id="00-37-09">00:37:09</a>]  - Well basically, I'll be blunt,

[<a id="00-37-12">00:37:12</a>]  I have to sit down, put my pervert cap on,

[<a id="00-37-15">00:37:15</a>]  trying to figure out what spot men want to get ready

[<a id="00-37-18">00:37:18</a>]  to masturbate to.

[<a id="00-37-19">00:37:19</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-37-20">00:37:20</a>]  - Like in Hollywood movies, you have chapter porn

[<a id="00-37-22">00:37:22</a>]  where each time something new story happens,

[<a id="00-37-24">00:37:24</a>]  you put a porn.

[<a id="00-37-25">00:37:25</a>]  I only put points where people are ready

[<a id="00-37-27">00:37:27</a>]  to masturbate to that spot.

[<a id="00-37-28">00:37:28</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-37-29">00:37:29</a>]  - And since I don't have technical skill,

[<a id="00-37-32">00:37:32</a>]  but I am above average pervert IQ,

[<a id="00-37-37">00:37:37</a>]  because working at the porn shop,

[<a id="00-37-39">00:37:39</a>]  you have all the training dealing with customers like,

[<a id="00-37-42">00:37:42</a>]  I didn't like this movie because this happened

[<a id="00-37-44">00:37:44</a>]  or didn't happen, you know?

[<a id="00-37-45">00:37:45</a>]  - So people would give you feedback on porn movies?

[<a id="00-37-49">00:37:49</a>]  - Or they complain.

[<a id="00-37-50">00:37:50</a>]  - Jesus Christ.

[<a id="00-37-52">00:37:52</a>]  - Not every, is this the original?

[<a id="00-37-54">00:37:54</a>]  - Every weird thing that you could possibly have porn shop,

[<a id="00-37-57">00:37:57</a>]  I heard it all.

[<a id="00-37-58">00:37:58</a>]  - Is this the original version of commenting

[<a id="00-38-01">00:38:01</a>]  on movies on U-Porn?

[<a id="00-38-03">00:38:03</a>]  Like, I was always confused.

[<a id="00-38-05">00:38:05</a>]  - It really is, it really is.

[<a id="00-38-06">00:38:06</a>]  I was so confused about this.

[<a id="00-38-07">00:38:07</a>]  Like, why the fuck would you do that?

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  Taking the time, it's like, oh yeah, great pitch.

[<a id="00-38-12">00:38:12</a>]  I'm like, okay, whatever.

[<a id="00-38-14">00:38:14</a>]  So people would do that to you in the shop?

[<a id="00-38-17">00:38:17</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-38-18">00:38:18</a>]  Or they would complain, like,

[<a id="00-38-20">00:38:20</a>]  or they would talk about like,

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  well, I think this porn star is better in this scene.

[<a id="00-38-24">00:38:24</a>]  They have these arguments or,

[<a id="00-38-27">00:38:27</a>]  so I have other colleagues who work way longer than me.

[<a id="00-38-31">00:38:31</a>]  So I learned, you learn from them,

[<a id="00-38-35">00:38:35</a>]  like the, look, and it's just like stand-up comedy,

[<a id="00-38-39">00:38:39</a>]  like they say stand-up comedy is art,

[<a id="00-38-42">00:38:42</a>]  but it is, but it isn't because,

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  maybe any other performance or any other form of art,

[<a id="00-38-48">00:38:48</a>]  you could get scholarship.

[<a id="00-38-49">00:38:49</a>]  You can't get scholarship with stand-up comedy.

[<a id="00-38-51">00:38:51</a>]  - No. - No.

[<a id="00-38-52">00:38:52</a>]  You can in painting, sculpture, dancing,

[<a id="00-38-54">00:38:54</a>]  you name it, all kinds of weird shit.

[<a id="00-38-56">00:38:56</a>]  - Expressive dance.

[<a id="00-38-58">00:38:58</a>]  - Yeah, so there's no school for like pornography 101,

[<a id="00-39-01">00:39:01</a>]  and just like there's no stand-up comedy 101.

[<a id="00-39-03">00:39:03</a>]  So these two different things,

[<a id="00-39-04">00:39:04</a>]  you just kind of learn on your own.

[<a id="00-39-06">00:39:06</a>]  You watch, and then you learn from hard lessons, right?

[<a id="00-39-10">00:39:10</a>]  So working, dealing with a customer,

[<a id="00-39-12">00:39:12</a>]  both good, bad, and ugly, and dealing with my coworkers,

[<a id="00-39-16">00:39:16</a>]  you quickly learn like,

[<a id="00-39-18">00:39:18</a>]  very expensive history of erotica, right?

[<a id="00-39-21">00:39:21</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-39-22">00:39:22</a>]  - Like if you deal with conservative religious people,

[<a id="00-39-27">00:39:27</a>]  although I get they seem more credible to me,

[<a id="00-39-32">00:39:32</a>]  because when you're a religious person

[<a id="00-39-35">00:39:35</a>]  versus a liberal person,

[<a id="00-39-36">00:39:36</a>]  guess who knows one side,

[<a id="00-39-40">00:39:40</a>]  guess which side know more about other person.

[<a id="00-39-43">00:39:43</a>]  You think conservative person know more about liberal person,

[<a id="00-39-45">00:39:45</a>]  liberal person know more about conservative.

[<a id="00-39-46">00:39:46</a>]  What do you think?

[<a id="00-39-47">00:39:47</a>]  - Oh, it's the other way around.

[<a id="00-39-50">00:39:50</a>]  Conservatives know more about liberals.

[<a id="00-39-51">00:39:51</a>]  - Right, and the reason is, in my opinion,

[<a id="00-39-55">00:39:55</a>]  is because conservative people are religious people.

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  Religious people read a lot of the religious texts,

[<a id="00-40-01">00:40:01</a>]  and when you read the Bible, or Quran,

[<a id="00-40-03">00:40:03</a>]  or these religious books,

[<a id="00-40-06">00:40:06</a>]  one thing I notice about them,

[<a id="00-40-08">00:40:08</a>]  they have a very extensive view of the universe.

[<a id="00-40-11">00:40:11</a>]  They get the big picture,

[<a id="00-40-12">00:40:12</a>]  but because liberal people never read

[<a id="00-40-14">00:40:14</a>]  a lot of these religious texts,

[<a id="00-40-16">00:40:16</a>]  it's always surprised to me when somebody say,

[<a id="00-40-19">00:40:19</a>]  something, something wanna do it to take us to promised land.

[<a id="00-40-22">00:40:22</a>]  Young people don't have no idea that's like Moses,

[<a id="00-40-25">00:40:25</a>]  and also Martin Luther King using that phrase in speech,

[<a id="00-40-29">00:40:29</a>]  because anybody who has a religious background

[<a id="00-40-31">00:40:31</a>]  would know that.

[<a id="00-40-32">00:40:32</a>]  You talk to young white kids, especially young liberal kids,

[<a id="00-40-37">00:40:37</a>]  they didn't know that.

[<a id="00-40-38">00:40:38</a>]  But conservative people also watch televisions and movies,

[<a id="00-40-41">00:40:41</a>]  so they know the liberal people's thinking.

[<a id="00-40-43">00:40:43</a>]  - They-- - They know that.

[<a id="00-40-44">00:40:44</a>]  - They know that, but--

[<a id="00-40-46">00:40:46</a>]  - It's not that they agree, but they watch,

[<a id="00-40-48">00:40:48</a>]  if you watch enough movie and television,

[<a id="00-40-50">00:40:50</a>]  they know what they think.

[<a id="00-40-51">00:40:51</a>]  So what I noticed like for the last five, seven years,

[<a id="00-40-55">00:40:55</a>]  anyone could be unreasonable,

[<a id="00-40-57">00:40:57</a>]  but liberal people think to be more unreasonable,

[<a id="00-40-59">00:40:59</a>]  because they don't know, except looking at the big picture,

[<a id="00-41-03">00:41:03</a>]  because-- - It's more narrow.

[<a id="00-41-05">00:41:05</a>]  - They only know their thing,

[<a id="00-41-06">00:41:06</a>]  whereas conservative knows their view,

[<a id="00-41-08">00:41:08</a>]  and on top of it, their background.

[<a id="00-41-10">00:41:10</a>]  So-- - Because conservatives

[<a id="00-41-11">00:41:11</a>]  need to know what they need to say no to.

[<a id="00-41-13">00:41:13</a>]  - Yes, but they just, they just are,

[<a id="00-41-15">00:41:15</a>]  these liberal people trained by TV and movies.

[<a id="00-41-19">00:41:19</a>]  - Yeah, yeah. - You know?

[<a id="00-41-20">00:41:20</a>]  So the reason I'm telling you, working with these guys,

[<a id="00-41-23">00:41:23</a>]  I only know little bits of porno stuff,

[<a id="00-41-25">00:41:25</a>]  but once you work in those jobs,

[<a id="00-41-27">00:41:27</a>]  I got pretty good training in history

[<a id="00-41-31">00:41:31</a>]  of erotica and pornography,

[<a id="00-41-33">00:41:33</a>]  and when I meet like old perverts,

[<a id="00-41-35">00:41:35</a>]  they'll tell me like, well,

[<a id="00-41-37">00:41:37</a>]  if you think this guy's a good performer,

[<a id="00-41-38">00:41:38</a>]  you should have seen this performer,

[<a id="00-41-40">00:41:40</a>]  or one guy was, one time I had a customer,

[<a id="00-41-42">00:41:42</a>]  I think, was it Pretty Peaches?

[<a id="00-41-47">00:41:47</a>]  I can't, it's one of those movies where,

[<a id="00-41-49">00:41:49</a>]  did you know that was the first movie that had a fisting?

[<a id="00-41-51">00:41:51</a>]  So we had like a long talk about fisting in the movie, right?

[<a id="00-41-56">00:41:56</a>]  And-- - Wait, where does that talk

[<a id="00-41-58">00:41:58</a>]  happen, at the checkout?

[<a id="00-42-00">00:42:00</a>]  - Yeah, because, so-- - Wait, hang on, hang on,

[<a id="00-42-05">00:42:05</a>]  sorry, sorry, I wanna set the scene here.

[<a id="00-42-07">00:42:07</a>]  So you're in the shop, you're working at the checkout,

[<a id="00-42-10">00:42:10</a>]  right, so let's assume I go to buy a pair of jeans, right?

[<a id="00-42-14">00:42:14</a>]  And I'm gonna have a discussion about it's like,

[<a id="00-42-16">00:42:16</a>]  oh, skinny doesn't really work for me,

[<a id="00-42-18">00:42:18</a>]  can you get me something that works a little better?

[<a id="00-42-21">00:42:21</a>]  - Or I say like, I know you like that jeans,

[<a id="00-42-23">00:42:23</a>]  but you know what, I think I have X, Y, and Z jeans

[<a id="00-42-27">00:42:27</a>]  over here, you look great, not only you look great,

[<a id="00-42-32">00:42:32</a>]  but because of your skin tone, that looks great on you,

[<a id="00-42-35">00:42:35</a>]  but it's also hip, so it's comfortable.

[<a id="00-42-39">00:42:39</a>]  So that's my-- - So you do this for porn?

[<a id="00-42-41">00:42:41</a>]  - Yeah, like when you go to Apple store,

[<a id="00-42-44">00:42:44</a>]  you have a genie's bar, we have a pervert bar,

[<a id="00-42-47">00:42:47</a>]  I'm your pervert, right?

[<a id="00-42-49">00:42:49</a>]  - Pervert in residence.

[<a id="00-42-52">00:42:52</a>]  - Yeah, and when people have these kind of things,

[<a id="00-42-55">00:42:55</a>]  even they don't have therapists,

[<a id="00-42-56">00:42:56</a>]  it's kind of really weird,

[<a id="00-42-58">00:42:58</a>]  so they don't have anybody to talk to, I become your guy,

[<a id="00-43-02">00:43:02</a>]  but two, when you're the new guy working at the porn shop,

[<a id="00-43-05">00:43:05</a>]  you always get the worst time slot,

[<a id="00-43-07">00:43:07</a>]  like most people don't wanna work midnight to 9 a.m. slot,

[<a id="00-43-10">00:43:10</a>]  and because I wanna have a job--

[<a id="00-43-11">00:43:11</a>]  - That's prime wanking time.

[<a id="00-43-13">00:43:13</a>]  - But a lot of people rather not work midnight shift,

[<a id="00-43-17">00:43:17</a>]  because a lot of time you have more problems.

[<a id="00-43-20">00:43:20</a>]  - Of course, no, that's what I mean,

[<a id="00-43-22">00:43:22</a>]  like this is when it's already charged,

[<a id="00-43-24">00:43:24</a>]  like nothing good happens after midnight, we know that.

[<a id="00-43-27">00:43:27</a>]  - But my idea is even when you're putting

[<a id="00-43-29">00:43:29</a>]  in a disadvantaged situations,

[<a id="00-43-31">00:43:31</a>]  if you spend time, get to know the job,

[<a id="00-43-33">00:43:33</a>]  you can make advantage for yourself.

[<a id="00-43-36">00:43:36</a>]  So I ended up doing stuff there,

[<a id="00-43-38">00:43:38</a>]  even though my bosses didn't know,

[<a id="00-43-39">00:43:39</a>]  'cause they never show up at midnight.

[<a id="00-43-41">00:43:41</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-43-42">00:43:42</a>]  - I made it as,

[<a id="00-43-44">00:43:44</a>]  I almost made it like it was my show.

[<a id="00-43-50">00:43:50</a>]  And I made a clinic out of it.

[<a id="00-43-54">00:43:54</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-43-54">00:43:54</a>]  - So what happened was, a lot of times,

[<a id="00-43-57">00:43:57</a>]  especially like this time of year,

[<a id="00-43-58">00:43:58</a>]  it's so fucking cold in Seattle, like rainy, it will snow.

[<a id="00-44-01">00:44:01</a>]  Sometimes people walk in,

[<a id="00-44-05">00:44:05</a>]  and you know, you gotta remember,

[<a id="00-44-11">00:44:11</a>]  every day somebody's turning 18 years old,

[<a id="00-44-14">00:44:14</a>]  and they have all kinds of questions.

[<a id="00-44-17">00:44:17</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-44-18">00:44:18</a>]  And online stuff wasn't really a factor.

[<a id="00-44-22">00:44:22</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-44-22">00:44:22</a>]  - Right?

[<a id="00-44-23">00:44:23</a>]  So what I did was,

[<a id="00-44-26">00:44:26</a>]  - 1839 parties have a porn story.

[<a id="00-44-29">00:44:29</a>]  - It did something to me,

[<a id="00-44-34">00:44:34</a>]  I didn't anticipate, in a really weird way,

[<a id="00-44-40">00:44:40</a>]  it gave me opportunity to be more humane to people,

[<a id="00-44-46">00:44:46</a>]  and it gave me opportunity to be generous with people,

[<a id="00-44-49">00:44:49</a>]  that which I didn't anticipate.

[<a id="00-44-51">00:44:51</a>]  - Wow.

[<a id="00-44-52">00:44:52</a>]  - So what happened was,

[<a id="00-44-53">00:44:53</a>]  here's a couple of examples, right?

[<a id="00-44-59">00:44:59</a>]  'Cause people just wanna minimize people

[<a id="00-45-03">00:45:03</a>]  by calling them perverts, and that's it.

[<a id="00-45-05">00:45:05</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-45-06">00:45:06</a>]  - End of the story, black and white.

[<a id="00-45-07">00:45:07</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-45-08">00:45:08</a>]  - Star Wars, good and bad guy.

[<a id="00-45-09">00:45:09</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-45-10">00:45:10</a>]  - Blah, blah, blah.

[<a id="00-45-11">00:45:11</a>]  Just like you have this sort of music

[<a id="00-45-13">00:45:13</a>]  attached to Darth Vader being a bad guy,

[<a id="00-45-16">00:45:16</a>]  you could play pervert music anytime these guys walk in.

[<a id="00-45-19">00:45:19</a>]  That's the end of the story.

[<a id="00-45-20">00:45:20</a>]  There's nothing more to them.

[<a id="00-45-22">00:45:22</a>]  They're worthless human beings, they're perverts.

[<a id="00-45-24">00:45:24</a>]  That's that.

[<a id="00-45-25">00:45:25</a>]  And I went in thinking that too,

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  'cause I went in, how much money they were making,

[<a id="00-45-29">00:45:29</a>]  I went in with a bad attitude, like,

[<a id="00-45-31">00:45:31</a>]  oh, this is something they could make a lot of money.

[<a id="00-45-33">00:45:33</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-45-34">00:45:34</a>]  - So, for example, here's a couple examples, right?

[<a id="00-45-42">00:45:42</a>]  A guy walked in, I checked, when they were looking young,

[<a id="00-45-46">00:45:46</a>]  you know, I checked their IDs, you know,

[<a id="00-45-48">00:45:48</a>]  and he just turned 18 that day.

[<a id="00-45-50">00:45:50</a>]  - That day?

[<a id="00-45-52">00:45:52</a>]  - Yeah, literally 18 that day.

[<a id="00-45-53">00:45:53</a>]  And I think he was, somebody kinda far away from Seattle

[<a id="00-45-57">00:45:57</a>]  kinda drove, it's like a middle,

[<a id="00-45-58">00:45:58</a>]  I don't wanna say their redneck area,

[<a id="00-46-00">00:46:00</a>]  but it's kinda like more nature-y area, you know?

[<a id="00-46-04">00:46:04</a>]  He drove, and he was asking gay porn,

[<a id="00-46-12">00:46:12</a>]  and, you know, I don't watch it, but I cannot say like,

[<a id="00-46-17">00:46:17</a>]  oh, don't watch that fucking perverted shit,

[<a id="00-46-21">00:46:21</a>]  that's disgusting, you know, you don't wanna do that.

[<a id="00-46-23">00:46:23</a>]  - I know what you mean, yeah.

[<a id="00-46-25">00:46:25</a>]  - So, what I do is I read AVN, which is adult video news,

[<a id="00-46-28">00:46:28</a>]  they have reviews for gay movies.

[<a id="00-46-31">00:46:31</a>]  So like, well, I haven't seen this movie,

[<a id="00-46-32">00:46:32</a>]  but I noticed like the last six months ago

[<a id="00-46-36">00:46:36</a>]  doing gay AVN awards, Jeff Strickland won so many awards,

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  you know, this one got five dips out of five dips, right?

[<a id="00-46-45">00:46:45</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-46-47">00:46:47</a>]  So, Chichi Rauru, I don't know, he directed this one,

[<a id="00-46-52">00:46:52</a>]  the Jeff Striker or something.

[<a id="00-46-53">00:46:53</a>]  So like, I know the right language make them comfortable.

[<a id="00-46-57">00:46:57</a>]  - Right, this one's trusty.

[<a id="00-47-00">00:47:00</a>]  - Yeah, so like, if you're looking for these kind

[<a id="00-47-03">00:47:03</a>]  of looking guys, or you like kinda chubby, heavy bears,

[<a id="00-47-08">00:47:08</a>]  yeah, then I tell them like, you know, you should try

[<a id="00-47-10">00:47:10</a>]  Falcon, or Bill and Me, you know, these are like

[<a id="00-47-13">00:47:13</a>]  a couple of foreign companies, right?

[<a id="00-47-15">00:47:15</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-47-17">00:47:17</a>]  - And I have an incentive because you get commission

[<a id="00-47-19">00:47:19</a>]  when you see all this stuff like that, too.

[<a id="00-47-21">00:47:21</a>]  - Oh, yes, okay, this is where the money comes from.

[<a id="00-47-23">00:47:23</a>]  - Yeah, so I do it, so like he picked four or five movies,

[<a id="00-47-27">00:47:27</a>]  you know, maybe one, I don't care, he picked something,

[<a id="00-47-30">00:47:30</a>]  he came back next day, and he did something

[<a id="00-47-36">00:47:36</a>]  that it was pretty obvious even from a rookie porn clerk

[<a id="00-47-41">00:47:41</a>]  that he probably wasn't sure about himself,

[<a id="00-47-46">00:47:46</a>]  confused maybe, maybe feel a little guilty.

[<a id="00-47-49">00:47:49</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-47-50">00:47:50</a>]  - So what he does is, anybody who loves sushi,

[<a id="00-47-53">00:47:53</a>]  you know that little bit of that ginger thing,

[<a id="00-47-55">00:47:55</a>]  that thing they have, so the reason why you have that,

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  when you have, you pick something like Maguro,

[<a id="00-48-00">00:48:00</a>]  it's delicious, you eat that to wipe out your taste,

[<a id="00-48-04">00:48:04</a>]  and you could appreciate savoriness of another sushi,

[<a id="00-48-08">00:48:08</a>]  right? - Sure.

[<a id="00-48-09">00:48:09</a>]  - So I think what he-- - Cleanser.

[<a id="00-48-11">00:48:11</a>]  - Cleanser, and I think what he was trying to do

[<a id="00-48-13">00:48:13</a>]  because he felt guilty, he tried to get

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  full heterosexual porn.

[<a id="00-48-17">00:48:17</a>]  - No, that was his cleanser?

[<a id="00-48-19">00:48:19</a>]  - Cleanser, and I told him like, you know,

[<a id="00-48-21">00:48:21</a>]  the more you rent, we make money,

[<a id="00-48-23">00:48:23</a>]  but if you feel guilty of getting gay porn,

[<a id="00-48-28">00:48:28</a>]  you should feel that way, you know?

[<a id="00-48-31">00:48:31</a>]  And I talked to him for a little bit.

[<a id="00-48-32">00:48:32</a>]  - Wow.

[<a id="00-48-33">00:48:33</a>]  - And I got to know the kid, and it just shows like,

[<a id="00-48-38">00:48:38</a>]  that generation is so different,

[<a id="00-48-44">00:48:44</a>]  'cause these kids are so entitled.

[<a id="00-48-46">00:48:46</a>]  - What year are we talking here?

[<a id="00-48-48">00:48:48</a>]  - 1999.

[<a id="00-48-49">00:48:49</a>]  - 1999, okay.

[<a id="00-48-50">00:48:50</a>]  - Yeah, so 25 years ago.

[<a id="00-48-51">00:48:51</a>]  - Wow.

[<a id="00-48-53">00:48:53</a>]  - So when I got to know him, you know these days like,

[<a id="00-48-58">00:48:58</a>]  my fucking family hate me because I'm gay,

[<a id="00-49-02">00:49:02</a>]  fuck them, like that, but I think people

[<a id="00-49-06">00:49:06</a>]  who were actually struggling with it back then,

[<a id="00-49-08">00:49:08</a>]  and they're trying not to be a center of attention,

[<a id="00-49-11">00:49:11</a>]  they're not attention whore,

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  this is something they were honestly struggling.

[<a id="00-49-14">00:49:14</a>]  He was basically telling me he was worried

[<a id="00-49-18">00:49:18</a>]  about how his parents gonna react when he's gay,

[<a id="00-49-23">00:49:23</a>]  'cause he didn't want his religious parents to think

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  our son is gay because we failed to raise our son.

[<a id="00-49-30">00:49:30</a>]  - As a parent, yeah.

[<a id="00-49-31">00:49:31</a>]  - Yeah, that's what he was worried about,

[<a id="00-49-33">00:49:33</a>]  and that is such a noticeably different group.

[<a id="00-49-36">00:49:36</a>]  Just like, I don't like the new gay kids,

[<a id="00-49-39">00:49:39</a>]  I don't like the new--

[<a id="00-49-40">00:49:40</a>]  - You don't like the new kids.

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  - New transgender people, because when these kids complain

[<a id="00-49-45">00:49:45</a>]  how much they're struggling, they have no fucking idea

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  what my transgender friends in the late 90s and 80s

[<a id="00-49-52">00:49:52</a>]  have to deal with.

[<a id="00-49-53">00:49:53</a>]  When they say life ended, they really mean life ended.

[<a id="00-49-56">00:49:56</a>]  They get killed back then, dude.

[<a id="00-49-57">00:49:57</a>]  - Yeah, I know, like there was murders.

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  - And these kids right here, they give me slow service

[<a id="00-50-04">00:50:04</a>]  because I'm transgender, my God.

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  Just count your blessing, you fucking piece of shit.

[<a id="00-50-08">00:50:08</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-50-11">00:50:11</a>]  - The victim mentality is a big one.

[<a id="00-50-13">00:50:13</a>]  - Yeah, so I was able to be generous with that person.

[<a id="00-50-18">00:50:18</a>]  I was also situations like a lady who survived Holocaust,

[<a id="00-50-23">00:50:23</a>]  she was married, her husband passed away,

[<a id="00-50-27">00:50:27</a>]  but they didn't really could communicate

[<a id="00-50-29">00:50:29</a>]  what they had at once from sex.

[<a id="00-50-30">00:50:30</a>]  Now her husband's dead, she's shy,

[<a id="00-50-34">00:50:34</a>]  and she was way older than me.

[<a id="00-50-35">00:50:35</a>]  It was a very awkward conversation,

[<a id="00-50-36">00:50:36</a>]  but I told her that we could go gently and slow.

[<a id="00-50-39">00:50:39</a>]  You don't have to go crazy.

[<a id="00-50-41">00:50:41</a>]  - You said to her, we can go gently and slow?

[<a id="00-50-45">00:50:45</a>]  - Yeah, you don't go from zero to 69 miles an hour.

[<a id="00-50-50">00:50:50</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, literally 69.

[<a id="00-50-54">00:50:54</a>]  So I think what I did was I kind of made it fun.

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  Whenever I had a customer to answer a question,

[<a id="00-51-05">00:51:05</a>]  they wanna figure out, I'm into this kind of fetish.

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  So what I do, like, oh, just tell me what are you into?

[<a id="00-51-13">00:51:13</a>]  And then I process that.

[<a id="00-51-16">00:51:16</a>]  Oh, I think you're looking at this,

[<a id="00-51-18">00:51:18</a>]  so I'll bring the tape and I'll--

[<a id="00-51-19">00:51:19</a>]  - Bring some NBA.

[<a id="00-51-21">00:51:21</a>]  - I will show this, but were you looking

[<a id="00-51-22">00:51:22</a>]  for something like this, right?

[<a id="00-51-24">00:51:24</a>]  And like, if they were depressed,

[<a id="00-51-25">00:51:25</a>]  why don't you get this movie, this and that,

[<a id="00-51-27">00:51:27</a>]  here's two buck plug and call me in the morning, right?

[<a id="00-51-30">00:51:30</a>]  So that's what I did, because I don't wanna make them

[<a id="00-51-35">00:51:35</a>]  feel bad, you know?

[<a id="00-51-38">00:51:38</a>]  - So, but you mentioned something before,

[<a id="00-51-40">00:51:40</a>]  I wanna tie this back, because I find this fascinating.

[<a id="00-51-42">00:51:42</a>]  So you have this vast education in porn over time

[<a id="00-51-47">00:51:47</a>]  as a salesperson, literally.

[<a id="00-51-48">00:51:48</a>]  Like you're literally selling porn.

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  - Well, you get free rentals,

[<a id="00-51-51">00:51:51</a>]  so I was able to watch other stuff

[<a id="00-51-52">00:51:52</a>]  I've never normally watched, like,

[<a id="00-51-55">00:51:55</a>]  because I think, I mean, when you actually spend your money,

[<a id="00-51-59">00:51:59</a>]  you can't watch everything, it costs a lot to do that.

[<a id="00-52-02">00:52:02</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-52-03">00:52:03</a>]  - And that's why we have sometimes customers

[<a id="00-52-07">00:52:07</a>]  standing in the store like hour,

[<a id="00-52-09">00:52:09</a>]  'cause they will look at the box cover,

[<a id="00-52-11">00:52:11</a>]  front and back, sideways.

[<a id="00-52-13">00:52:13</a>]  Sometimes I had a customer like, hey, motherfucker,

[<a id="00-52-15">00:52:15</a>]  you see, he showed me the box, right, side, the side part,

[<a id="00-52-19">00:52:19</a>]  this one girl in the corner, that girl was in the movie,

[<a id="00-52-21">00:52:21</a>]  you just ripped me off, you know,

[<a id="00-52-23">00:52:23</a>]  they always do shit like that.

[<a id="00-52-25">00:52:25</a>]  So I look like, like, you know, so every annoying thing

[<a id="00-52-30">00:52:30</a>]  that could happen in porn show, I had to deal with that.

[<a id="00-52-37">00:52:37</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-52-38">00:52:38</a>]  - But because I deal with it,

[<a id="00-52-39">00:52:39</a>]  I had experience dealing with that sort of things,

[<a id="00-52-43">00:52:43</a>]  and like, wow, I didn't even even thought about that,

[<a id="00-52-45">00:52:45</a>]  or that kind of finish or whatever, right?

[<a id="00-52-47">00:52:47</a>]  - So then Evil Angel hires you,

[<a id="00-52-50">00:52:50</a>]  and you're the only person that applies,

[<a id="00-52-53">00:52:53</a>]  which is a good start.

[<a id="00-52-55">00:52:55</a>]  So you--

[<a id="00-52-56">00:52:56</a>]  - Well, and that's 2003, but 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999,

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  every year I'll visit that booth,

[<a id="00-53-03">00:53:03</a>]  and I got to know John Staliano,

[<a id="00-53-05">00:53:05</a>]  and the reason why I like John Staliano--

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  - When you say you visit that booth, what do you mean?

[<a id="00-53-10">00:53:10</a>]  - Once a year, back in those days,

[<a id="00-53-12">00:53:12</a>]  they have a porn convention in Vegas.

[<a id="00-53-14">00:53:14</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-53-15">00:53:15</a>]  - So originally, the porn convention was part of CES,

[<a id="00-53-18">00:53:18</a>]  which is Consumer Electronics Shows.

[<a id="00-53-20">00:53:20</a>]  - Holy fuck.

[<a id="00-53-22">00:53:22</a>]  That was, so, okay, here's the new Discman,

[<a id="00-53-25">00:53:25</a>]  and these are triple Ds, porn videos.

[<a id="00-53-30">00:53:30</a>]  - Yeah, so a lot of time back in those days,

[<a id="00-53-32">00:53:32</a>]  a lot of these husbands who knew that,

[<a id="00-53-34">00:53:34</a>]  but their wife didn't know,

[<a id="00-53-36">00:53:36</a>]  honey, I'm going to Consumer Electronics Show for--

[<a id="00-53-38">00:53:38</a>]  - Yes, it was a color mission.

[<a id="00-53-41">00:53:41</a>]  - We went to get new TV for our basement,

[<a id="00-53-44">00:53:44</a>]  or they weren't pretty high tech, they went,

[<a id="00-53-47">00:53:47</a>]  but porn was kind of turning into a bigger business,

[<a id="00-53-52">00:53:52</a>]  and I think what happened was,

[<a id="00-53-54">00:53:54</a>]  Japanese created VHS tape, VCR,

[<a id="00-54-01">00:54:01</a>]  which became implemented in pornography,

[<a id="00-54-05">00:54:05</a>]  and there was a collision of high tech

[<a id="00-54-06">00:54:06</a>]  and pornography all the time,

[<a id="00-54-07">00:54:07</a>]  and every time there's new technology,

[<a id="00-54-10">00:54:10</a>]  eroticism kind of benefited from it.

[<a id="00-54-12">00:54:12</a>]  So when they started putting VHS and VCR,

[<a id="00-54-18">00:54:18</a>]  in American market during Vegas,

[<a id="00-54-20">00:54:20</a>]  that coincided with the Virgin marketing in pornography,

[<a id="00-54-25">00:54:25</a>]  and every year, CES had the porn section,

[<a id="00-54-29">00:54:29</a>]  until I think around 2002, three or four,

[<a id="00-54-32">00:54:32</a>]  where AVN decided to have their own thing,

[<a id="00-54-34">00:54:34</a>]  because they could make money controlling the whole thing.

[<a id="00-54-37">00:54:37</a>]  - And it was a growing business at the time as well,

[<a id="00-54-40">00:54:40</a>]  like it started fringy,

[<a id="00-54-41">00:54:41</a>]  but then suddenly became a multi-million dollar business.

[<a id="00-54-44">00:54:44</a>]  - Sure, so my experience in CES and porn,

[<a id="00-54-48">00:54:48</a>]  and when I went, it's such a really weird feeling,

[<a id="00-54-53">00:54:53</a>]  when you go to the 1999, when I went,

[<a id="00-54-59">00:54:59</a>]  because I definitely, working, watch so much porn,

[<a id="00-55-05">00:55:05</a>]  that when I meet somebody,

[<a id="00-55-07">00:55:07</a>]  I'm meeting this person for the first time,

[<a id="00-55-08">00:55:08</a>]  I know exactly what her butthole looks like.

[<a id="00-55-11">00:55:11</a>]  - Jesus.

[<a id="00-55-12">00:55:12</a>]  - And what position she likes, you know?

[<a id="00-55-14">00:55:14</a>]  I had a triple x-ray vision of what they're into, you know?

[<a id="00-55-18">00:55:18</a>]  - Sure.

[<a id="00-55-19">00:55:19</a>]  - They don't know anything about me,

[<a id="00-55-20">00:55:20</a>]  but I know everything about what she's capable of doing,

[<a id="00-55-23">00:55:23</a>]  what's her strengths and weaknesses as a performer,

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  and things like that.

[<a id="00-55-27">00:55:27</a>]  So when I went, it was a really weird, visceral reaction,

[<a id="00-55-30">00:55:30</a>]  but I went evil angel,

[<a id="00-55-32">00:55:32</a>]  because the guy who ran the company school,

[<a id="00-55-34">00:55:34</a>]  a guy named John Staliano, AKA Buttman,

[<a id="00-55-39">00:55:39</a>]  and he's Buttman because he has a business degree,

[<a id="00-55-44">00:55:44</a>]  he studied film in UCLA, he did a lot of dancing,

[<a id="00-55-48">00:55:48</a>]  and he also a Chippendale dancer.

[<a id="00-55-50">00:55:50</a>]  - Oh, wow.

[<a id="00-55-51">00:55:51</a>]  - And once he started working for a guy named Bill Marco,

[<a id="00-55-54">00:55:54</a>]  some people theorized that Bill Marco

[<a id="00-55-57">00:55:57</a>]  was one of the possible character

[<a id="00-55-59">00:55:59</a>]  that Quentin Tarantino was brainstorming

[<a id="00-56-02">00:56:02</a>]  to make that last movie, Copritic,

[<a id="00-56-04">00:56:04</a>]  which he canceled later on,

[<a id="00-56-05">00:56:05</a>]  but he was originally making a movie about porn,

[<a id="00-56-09">00:56:09</a>]  a guy who was reviewing movies in porn magazine,

[<a id="00-56-13">00:56:13</a>]  and Bill Marco was one of those kind of guys.

[<a id="00-56-15">00:56:15</a>]  Anyway, John used to work for him,

[<a id="00-56-18">00:56:18</a>]  he was one of the founders of Gonzo Porn,

[<a id="00-56-20">00:56:20</a>]  where you as a person who's filming is part of the story,

[<a id="00-56-24">00:56:24</a>]  like Parker S. Thompson is part of the story

[<a id="00-56-27">00:56:27</a>]  when he's writing the story.

[<a id="00-56-27">00:56:27</a>]  - First person vision, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-56-30">00:56:30</a>]  - So, and the reason why I was searching John Staliano,

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  'cause I like the movie Girls that he used,

[<a id="00-56-37">00:56:37</a>]  and he is shy with women,

[<a id="00-56-40">00:56:40</a>]  so he's not like confident like Marco Soprini,

[<a id="00-56-42">00:56:42</a>]  like club tickets club, that kind of guy, yeah.

[<a id="00-56-46">00:56:46</a>]  He's more relatable,

[<a id="00-56-47">00:56:47</a>]  but what I find so interesting with John

[<a id="00-56-49">00:56:49</a>]  is that he has Econ degree,

[<a id="00-56-52">00:56:52</a>]  he is also donating money to Cato Institute,

[<a id="00-56-55">00:56:55</a>]  which is like ultra-conservative sort of

[<a id="00-56-57">00:56:57</a>]  libertarian institute in Washington, D.C.,

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  and I find it really interesting with him

[<a id="00-57-02">00:57:02</a>]  because it is the collision of sex and money

[<a id="00-57-06">00:57:06</a>]  and conservatism.

[<a id="00-57-08">00:57:08</a>]  - He's not conservative,

[<a id="00-57-09">00:57:09</a>]  I think he's conservative in the sense that,

[<a id="00-57-12">00:57:12</a>]  not in a religious sense, he's conservative,

[<a id="00-57-15">00:57:15</a>]  I'm conservative in the sense that

[<a id="00-57-17">00:57:17</a>]  human nature really hasn't changed all that much

[<a id="00-57-20">00:57:20</a>]  since the beginning of God,

[<a id="00-57-22">00:57:22</a>]  and there's certain behaviors is predictable,

[<a id="00-57-25">00:57:25</a>]  but I like him because I think

[<a id="00-57-29">00:57:29</a>]  this is something that's clear when anybody got to know me,

[<a id="00-57-34">00:57:34</a>]  that whether you like it or not,

[<a id="00-57-37">00:57:37</a>]  sex and money do run the world,

[<a id="00-57-42">00:57:42</a>]  big chunk of it.

[<a id="00-57-43">00:57:43</a>]  - Absolutely.

[<a id="00-57-44">00:57:44</a>]  - And either someone has only worked in the money side,

[<a id="00-57-49">00:57:49</a>]  like the people at the World Union Forum,

[<a id="00-57-52">00:57:52</a>]  or somebody's a pervert on sex,

[<a id="00-57-54">00:57:54</a>]  but if we learn anything from Jeffrey Epstein

[<a id="00-57-58">00:57:58</a>]  is that here's a guy who has a lever

[<a id="00-58-01">00:58:01</a>]  called money and sex,

[<a id="00-58-04">00:58:04</a>]  so he is manipulating people by,

[<a id="00-58-08">00:58:08</a>]  you know--

[<a id="00-58-08">00:58:08</a>]  - The major strings.

[<a id="00-58-10">00:58:10</a>]  - Marinette, so if he's dealing with billionaires,

[<a id="00-58-13">00:58:13</a>]  they have more money than him,

[<a id="00-58-14">00:58:14</a>]  but he used sex to manipulate them,

[<a id="00-58-17">00:58:17</a>]  and he's dealing with people with no money,

[<a id="00-58-19">00:58:19</a>]  he'll use sex, I mean--

[<a id="00-58-20">00:58:20</a>]  - He'll use money.

[<a id="00-58-21">00:58:21</a>]  - Money to manipulate them,

[<a id="00-58-22">00:58:22</a>]  or various combination of those two things,

[<a id="00-58-26">00:58:26</a>]  and I didn't know that's what I was doing,

[<a id="00-58-29">00:58:29</a>]  'cause my original plan was just leaving my personal problem

[<a id="00-58-32">00:58:32</a>]  from Seattle, Washington,

[<a id="00-58-33">00:58:33</a>]  but I ended up spending the last 21 years

[<a id="00-58-37">00:58:37</a>]  working, doing standup,

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  but standup, I'm not really good at it,

[<a id="00-58-42">00:58:42</a>]  but that put me into show business world,

[<a id="00-58-46">00:58:46</a>]  where I ended up going to Tonight Show,

[<a id="00-58-48">00:58:48</a>]  I missed tons and tons of stars,

[<a id="00-58-50">00:58:50</a>]  which was revealing,

[<a id="00-58-53">00:58:53</a>]  but working in erotica and sex,

[<a id="00-58-55">00:58:55</a>]  I ended up meeting people

[<a id="00-58-56">00:58:56</a>]  that they probably don't want me to mention their names.

[<a id="00-58-59">00:58:59</a>]  So, I...

[<a id="00-59-02">00:59:02</a>]  - Can we close that loop quickly,

[<a id="00-59-03">00:59:03</a>]  because the one thing that you started talking about

[<a id="00-59-06">00:59:06</a>]  is the job that you had at Immilagio.

[<a id="00-59-08">00:59:08</a>]  So, you said you were not a technical person,

[<a id="00-59-13">00:59:13</a>]  but you were good at identifying the spots

[<a id="00-59-16">00:59:16</a>]  that people liked to,

[<a id="00-59-18">00:59:18</a>]  and the relationship was,

[<a id="00-59-19">00:59:19</a>]  you were relating this to your experience

[<a id="00-59-21">00:59:21</a>]  as a salesperson for porn, so you had this--

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  - And I'm familiar with John Staniak's movies.

[<a id="00-59-25">00:59:25</a>]  - Exactly, so you have this vision,

[<a id="00-59-28">00:59:28</a>]  or sorry, you have this understanding,

[<a id="00-59-30">00:59:30</a>]  this technical understanding of porn.

[<a id="00-59-33">00:59:33</a>]  - I don't have a technical skills,

[<a id="00-59-35">00:59:35</a>]  but I understand desire, fantasy, and eroticism,

[<a id="00-59-40">00:59:40</a>]  because I deal with those customers.

[<a id="00-59-43">00:59:43</a>]  - So, you were a DVD producer,

[<a id="00-59-45">00:59:45</a>]  which means you had to watch all the content.

[<a id="00-59-49">00:59:49</a>]  - Make sure everything's okay,

[<a id="00-59-50">00:59:50</a>]  make sure there's not questionable,

[<a id="00-59-52">00:59:52</a>]  make sure that when people move, audio sync with that.

[<a id="00-59-57">00:59:57</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="00-59-58">00:59:58</a>]  - Make sure their names are spelled correctly,

[<a id="01-00-00">01:00:00</a>]  make sure to put behind the scenes,

[<a id="01-00-01">01:00:01</a>]  cast listing, music, bonus scenes, and the chapter points.

[<a id="01-00-06">01:00:06</a>]  - So, this is what you refer to,

[<a id="01-00-09">01:00:09</a>]  like this is what people like to,

[<a id="01-00-11">01:00:11</a>]  where you know the chapter points, is that what you mean?

[<a id="01-00-13">01:00:13</a>]  - That's what I did, that's what they trained me to do.

[<a id="01-00-16">01:00:16</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="01-00-17">01:00:17</a>]  - So, from 2003, I moved to L.A. February 3rd, 2003.

[<a id="01-00-22">01:00:22</a>]  I moved to L.A. on the day I felt specter murdered that girl.

[<a id="01-00-31">01:00:31</a>]  - Jesus, so first the towers go down.

[<a id="01-00-37">01:00:37</a>]  - Second time I moved to L.A. was February 3rd, 2003,

[<a id="01-00-41">01:00:41</a>]  felt specter murdered.

[<a id="01-00-42">01:00:42</a>]  The first time was when I was getting kicked out

[<a id="01-00-43">01:00:43</a>]  of Washington State as a kid, summer of '85,

[<a id="01-00-47">01:00:47</a>]  and the day I land Long Beach,

[<a id="01-00-48">01:00:48</a>]  I think second Asian person was murdered

[<a id="01-00-50">01:00:50</a>]  by Richard Ramirez, night stalker, things like that.

[<a id="01-00-53">01:00:53</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-00-54">01:00:54</a>]  - So, that's what I did for nine years,

[<a id="01-00-58">01:00:58</a>]  and I think what happened,

[<a id="01-01-01">01:01:01</a>]  I don't know how much longer you want to do

[<a id="01-01-04">01:01:04</a>]  and stop and record the second part, so whatever.

[<a id="01-01-06">01:01:06</a>]  - We will record the second bit in a second,

[<a id="01-01-09">01:01:09</a>]  but finish your thought.

[<a id="01-01-10">01:01:10</a>]  - Couple things that happened accidentally, right?

[<a id="01-01-13">01:01:13</a>]  So, Jim Norton was hosting "Avian and War Jail"

[<a id="01-01-18">01:01:18</a>]  around the time I would start working for "Evil Angel."

[<a id="01-01-22">01:01:22</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="01-01-23">01:01:23</a>]  - And then the Jim knew that I was stand up,

[<a id="01-01-25">01:01:25</a>]  somebody told him I'm a comic or something,

[<a id="01-01-27">01:01:27</a>]  somebody told him, I don't remember who,

[<a id="01-01-29">01:01:29</a>]  so Jim contacted me and said I work for "Evil Angel,"

[<a id="01-01-31">01:01:31</a>]  so I brought him over to "Evil Angel."

[<a id="01-01-33">01:01:33</a>]  So, you know, I'm a comic and work in porn,

[<a id="01-01-36">01:01:36</a>]  and Jim is into transgender porn,

[<a id="01-01-41">01:01:41</a>]  and also, Joyce Savare, one of the Hall of Fame performer

[<a id="01-01-46">01:01:46</a>]  and the director, was one of the "Evil Angel" director in '97.

[<a id="01-01-51">01:01:51</a>]  He was the first mainstream pornographer

[<a id="01-01-54">01:01:54</a>]  to bring transgender porn into the,

[<a id="01-01-56">01:01:56</a>]  there's always been transgender porn,

[<a id="01-01-57">01:01:57</a>]  but they were like, obscure.

[<a id="01-02-00">01:02:00</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-02-01">01:02:01</a>]  - Below the radar, even in the porn,

[<a id="01-02-02">01:02:02</a>]  but Joyce Savare was the main name director,

[<a id="01-02-08">01:02:08</a>]  working for one of the biggest porn production company,

[<a id="01-02-11">01:02:11</a>]  and first one to make a movie called "Rogue Avengers,"

[<a id="01-02-16">01:02:16</a>]  where he put transgender,

[<a id="01-02-18">01:02:18</a>]  and '97 was such a strange year,

[<a id="01-02-20">01:02:20</a>]  and pivotal year for--

[<a id="01-02-21">01:02:21</a>]  - '97.

[<a id="01-02-22">01:02:22</a>]  - He was the first one to do it,

[<a id="01-02-24">01:02:24</a>]  but that's the same year my future boss, John Staliano,

[<a id="01-02-28">01:02:28</a>]  tested HIV, tested positive for HIV,

[<a id="01-02-33">01:02:33</a>]  'cause he had sex with a transgender prostitute,

[<a id="01-02-36">01:02:36</a>]  which sounds like redundant, in Brazil.

[<a id="01-02-39">01:02:39</a>]  So '97 was such a pivotal year,

[<a id="01-02-42">01:02:42</a>]  and it was around '96 and '97,

[<a id="01-02-44">01:02:44</a>]  invention of Viagra also changed

[<a id="01-02-47">01:02:47</a>]  the pornography business, too, you know?

[<a id="01-02-49">01:02:49</a>]  So--

[<a id="01-02-50">01:02:50</a>]  - I guess the shoots got simpler.

[<a id="01-02-52">01:02:52</a>]  - Yeah, and so that, on top of Jim,

[<a id="01-02-57">01:02:57</a>]  I start opening for him here and there,

[<a id="01-03-01">01:03:01</a>]  he took me to "Tonight Show,"

[<a id="01-03-02">01:03:02</a>]  and from "Tonight Show," and prior to "Tonight Show,"

[<a id="01-03-07">01:03:07</a>]  when you work for DVD department,

[<a id="01-03-09">01:03:09</a>]  you get a bunch of DVDs.

[<a id="01-03-11">01:03:11</a>]  We have a thing called check disc.

[<a id="01-03-12">01:03:12</a>]  Check disc is one step before you make final product.

[<a id="01-03-15">01:03:15</a>]  What you're supposed to do is look at the check disc

[<a id="01-03-17">01:03:17</a>]  and make sure everything works.

[<a id="01-03-19">01:03:19</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="01-03-20">01:03:20</a>]  - So everything, and if there's a problem,

[<a id="01-03-21">01:03:21</a>]  right, then all the problems need to be fixed.

[<a id="01-03-23">01:03:23</a>]  They fix it, they bring the second check disc,

[<a id="01-03-25">01:03:25</a>]  and if everything's okay,

[<a id="01-03-27">01:03:27</a>]  then we can make a final product.

[<a id="01-03-28">01:03:28</a>]  - Right.

[<a id="01-03-29">01:03:29</a>]  - Well, we have piles and piles and piles of check discs,

[<a id="01-03-31">01:03:31</a>]  and they're just piling up, they didn't do anything.

[<a id="01-03-33">01:03:33</a>]  I ask them, "What do you do with them?"

[<a id="01-03-35">01:03:35</a>]  Like, "Oh, we just throw away or give it to people."

[<a id="01-03-39">01:03:39</a>]  And that's when my life got

[<a id="01-03-40">01:03:40</a>]  really different level of weirdness,

[<a id="01-03-44">01:03:44</a>]  because I had a bunch of check discs.

[<a id="01-03-46">01:03:46</a>]  Sometimes I give to my friends, they really appreciate it,

[<a id="01-03-48">01:03:48</a>]  but you know what happened?

[<a id="01-03-49">01:03:49</a>]  One time, I went to some porn event,

[<a id="01-03-52">01:03:52</a>]  the summer of 2003, and I had to valet in my car.

[<a id="01-03-58">01:03:58</a>]  I didn't have a cash, so I said,

[<a id="01-03-59">01:03:59</a>]  "Sorry, man, I don't have anything,

[<a id="01-04-00">01:04:00</a>]  but I could be a porn disc."

[<a id="01-04-02">01:04:02</a>]  This guy was way more happy than getting a couple dollars.

[<a id="01-04-05">01:04:05</a>]  - Ha ha, you gave him porn, the valet guy?

[<a id="01-04-09">01:04:09</a>]  - On that day, I realized the power of giving DVDs, right?

[<a id="01-04-15">01:04:15</a>]  So I kind of parlay, in addition to getting weekly paycheck,

[<a id="01-04-22">01:04:22</a>]  those DVD led to budget interest,

[<a id="01-04-24">01:04:24</a>]  because when you work at the porn shop in Seattle,

[<a id="01-04-27">01:04:27</a>]  I remember like, sometimes we have our customers,

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  they want version DVDs and VHS.

[<a id="01-04-33">01:04:33</a>]  What that means is they are the first ones to rent that tape.

[<a id="01-04-37">01:04:37</a>]  - Oh, really?

[<a id="01-04-38">01:04:38</a>]  - Yeah, I would do those kind of service for like--

[<a id="01-04-40">01:04:40</a>]  - That's a thing.

[<a id="01-04-41">01:04:41</a>]  - That's a thing.

[<a id="01-04-42">01:04:42</a>]  They don't want to touch DVD

[<a id="01-04-42">01:04:42</a>]  where somebody's been jacking off to already.

[<a id="01-04-45">01:04:45</a>]  - Oh, of course.

[<a id="01-04-47">01:04:47</a>]  - Sometimes there's little fingerprints on DVDs and VHS,

[<a id="01-04-52">01:04:52</a>]  and they say, "Hey, motherfucker."

[<a id="01-04-55">01:04:55</a>]  Because when they return them like that,

[<a id="01-04-56">01:04:56</a>]  and these guys have a audacity.

[<a id="01-04-59">01:04:59</a>]  Or it was like, "Fuck you, mother,

[<a id="01-05-00">01:05:00</a>]  "there's blood in the corner of the DVD.

[<a id="01-05-03">01:05:03</a>]  "It wasn't like that, motherfucker."

[<a id="01-05-04">01:05:04</a>]  So we make them clean, and we penalize.

[<a id="01-05-07">01:05:07</a>]  So for customers like that, I would do it with my,

[<a id="01-05-11">01:05:11</a>]  it's like, "Hey Johnny, we got the new Jeff Schachter

[<a id="01-05-14">01:05:14</a>]  "gave porn, I'll save it for you."

[<a id="01-05-16">01:05:16</a>]  They appreciate like that, but you know what happened?

[<a id="01-05-19">01:05:19</a>]  We had a guy working from Fancy Restaurant across the street,

[<a id="01-05-25">01:05:25</a>]  and sometimes he'll bring me, he'll lie to the kitchen,

[<a id="01-05-30">01:05:30</a>]  and he'll make me this fancy, you know,

[<a id="01-05-34">01:05:34</a>]  Michelin star restaurant at the hotel,

[<a id="01-05-36">01:05:36</a>]  bring me food from there.

[<a id="01-05-37">01:05:37</a>]  He'll bring the whole thing with the thing on top of it.

[<a id="01-05-42">01:05:42</a>]  He'll walk across the--

[<a id="01-05-42">01:05:42</a>]  - Oh, who's that with the silver--

[<a id="01-05-44">01:05:44</a>]  - Yeah, he'll walk across the street

[<a id="01-05-46">01:05:46</a>]  from the Fancy Restaurant.

[<a id="01-05-47">01:05:47</a>]  (Johnny laughs)

[<a id="01-05-49">01:05:49</a>]  Across the street is the taboo video store.

[<a id="01-05-50">01:05:50</a>]  He'll bring the whole thing.

[<a id="01-05-52">01:05:52</a>]  Why, because I get rid of all his penalty fees,

[<a id="01-05-55">01:05:55</a>]  I always save him all the DVDs, shit like that.

[<a id="01-05-58">01:05:58</a>]  So I try to make business out of that thing,

[<a id="01-06-01">01:06:01</a>]  because here's the thing, people don't have to give you cash

[<a id="01-06-05">01:06:05</a>]  to get something in return, you know?

[<a id="01-06-07">01:06:07</a>]  So I used to get Sonic Stages,

[<a id="01-06-09">01:06:09</a>]  I used to get Mariners tickets, sometimes play tickets,

[<a id="01-06-12">01:06:12</a>]  or sometimes they'd bring me like, I don't know,

[<a id="01-06-15">01:06:15</a>]  bunch of different kind of shit with trade-off, you know?

[<a id="01-06-19">01:06:19</a>]  And I think by doing that, I became a little bit

[<a id="01-06-22">01:06:22</a>]  more personable, showmanship or whatever,

[<a id="01-06-25">01:06:25</a>]  'cause you know, I was a very shy, awkward guy.

[<a id="01-06-28">01:06:28</a>]  My mom forced me to work at her restaurant

[<a id="01-06-30">01:06:30</a>]  10 years before that, so I got more comfortable

[<a id="01-06-34">01:06:34</a>]  around people then, you know?

[<a id="01-06-35">01:06:35</a>]  - Sure, and introduction to the concept of crowd work.

[<a id="01-06-38">01:06:38</a>]  - Crowd work, yeah.

[<a id="01-06-39">01:06:39</a>]  But, so whenever I had a customer with problems,

[<a id="01-06-44">01:06:44</a>]  I'll show them little clips, like,

[<a id="01-06-46">01:06:46</a>]  oh, based on what you told me,

[<a id="01-06-47">01:06:47</a>]  I think you like these kind of moves, right?

[<a id="01-06-50">01:06:50</a>]  And I think that job really helped me

[<a id="01-06-55">01:06:55</a>]  that people are far more complicated, you know?

[<a id="01-06-58">01:06:58</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="01-06-58">01:06:58</a>]  - I had a God customer.

[<a id="01-07-00">01:07:00</a>]  - Wait, before we go into this,

[<a id="01-07-01">01:07:01</a>]  we're gonna take a break here.

[<a id="01-07-05">01:07:05</a>]  - Welcome to Project XXX, part one.

[<a id="01-07-08">01:07:08</a>]  - Part one.

[<a id="01-07-15">01:07:15</a>]  See, if I could, if I could.
