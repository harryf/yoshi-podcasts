# Transcript

[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  at school and at the same time there was a guy doing a podcast about Marc Dutroux who was the

[<a id="00-00-07">00:00:07</a>]  Belgian pedophile that kicked all this off and I connected the guy doing the podcast with her

[<a id="00-00-14">00:00:14</a>]  because I heard she was going to be in Belgium at the time he was like yeah he was releasing

[<a id="00-00-20">00:00:20</a>]  episode by episode and so they ended up yeah they ended up talking so I've had one phone call with

[<a id="00-00-28">00:00:28</a>]  her because she wanted to find nerd skills to um but if you I would I would try the lesson

[<a id="00-00-37">00:00:37</a>]  it just uh it's not that I'm ignoring you I have so many people send me shit all the time

[<a id="00-00-42">00:00:42</a>]  and the reason why I'm overwhelmed because it's just like oh you got to listen to this

[<a id="00-00-50">00:00:50</a>]  fucker you got to read this book you got to watch this tv you know I can't I can't keep

[<a id="00-00-55">00:00:55</a>]  track of everything yeah I think it's just a little too fucking much I know I get it I get

[<a id="00-01-00">00:01:00</a>]  it this this particular lady I just think she's interesting I know I want to listen to it now

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  because I know you don't you don't normally talk about the pedo things don't chop this off

[<a id="00-01-12">00:01:12</a>]  and the thing is she's kind of a key to unpacking a lot of the stuff like

[<a id="00-01-21">00:01:21</a>]  uh yeah I get the feeling a lot of this stuff's gonna get get exposed in a big way like the

[<a id="00-01-28">00:01:28</a>]  the epstein list in some form may come out I don't know any any of that will happen but um

[<a id="00-01-35">00:01:35</a>]  I don't want to make an impression that only rich people rape kids yeah believe me middle class and

[<a id="00-01-44">00:01:44</a>]  poor people too you know yeah yeah and uh that place I told you guys in Florida they used to

[<a id="00-01-52">00:01:52</a>]  call it miracle village it has a bunch of like richards the sixth offenders live there so I've

[<a id="00-01-56">00:01:56</a>]  been there four or five times talked to them um and I got people always kind of get snarky like

[<a id="00-02-04">00:02:04</a>]  they think I support them I support in a way that they should get help not do that kind of thing

[<a id="00-02-09">00:02:09</a>]  that got them in trouble first but if you want to protect kids you need to talk to these people and

[<a id="00-02-15">00:02:15</a>]  find out what happened to let them you know is it genetic is an environment yeah you know and then

[<a id="00-02-20">00:02:20</a>]  what's interesting is that that miracle village it's exactly 50 miles exactly 50 miles to that

[<a id="00-02-27">00:02:27</a>]  Jeffrey Epstein's home because I we measured that the driving distance from there yeah you know

[<a id="00-02-34">00:02:34</a>]  and when you're when you assault kids and if you have money you could get away with it

[<a id="00-02-39">00:02:39</a>]  yeah you know or you have a um special um treatment and you know I mean but let's let's maybe let's

[<a id="00-02-49">00:02:49</a>]  pause that and because I think you you had a pressing thing for today oh a couple okay so

[<a id="00-02-57">00:02:57</a>]  I've been here since Friday right so I got here Friday morning what is it now Monday morning so

[<a id="00-03-03">00:03:03</a>]  so you know some days 70 to 70 to 80 hours right

[<a id="00-03-09">00:03:09</a>]  today's a particularly interesting day because um November 25th 1970 something significant

[<a id="00-03-19">00:03:19</a>]  happened in Japan and I wouldn't expect you to know because not most 99% of young Japanese

[<a id="00-03-26">00:03:26</a>]  would know that there was a writer named well in the west they call him Yukio Mishima or Mishima

[<a id="00-03-35">00:03:35</a>]  Yukio he is a significant writer he's been in consideration for Nobel Prize for literature

[<a id="00-03-42">00:03:42</a>]  many times and on this day 54 years ago he committed ritual suicide when he tried to take

[<a id="00-03-49">00:03:49</a>]  defense department in Tokyo and why did he do that he went there with a bunch of his acolytes

[<a id="00-03-57">00:03:57</a>]  they dressed in just a military outfit and everybody called him fascist and this and that

[<a id="00-04-01">00:04:01</a>]  but you know what's interesting about this guy and this is something maybe Switzerland and many

[<a id="00-04-08">00:04:08</a>]  modern countries are suffering possibility Japan made a remarkable recovery since World War II

[<a id="00-04-18">00:04:18</a>]  there's no doubt about that you know well Japan has always done that remarkable advance back

[<a id="00-04-23">00:04:23</a>]  when when the Americans showed up in 1873 and World War II happened and then after that

[<a id="00-04-28">00:04:28</a>]  but he thought sometimes when you have too many good things and life get easier

[<a id="00-04-34">00:04:34</a>]  I don't want to say it's a spirituality but but this sense of being solid human being as a man

[<a id="00-04-43">00:04:43</a>]  these you know that disappear with modern comfort you know yeah and as I was watching the show

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  believe me I don't enjoy coming to Europe doing shows and get really weird actually with silence

[<a id="00-04-58">00:04:58</a>]  you know uh it's it's it's it it it it doesn't hurt my feelings it's not fun because a lot of times

[<a id="00-05-05">00:05:05</a>]  what what if I open for roster it's a completely different show but if I come here you know what

[<a id="00-05-11">00:05:11</a>]  it feels like because I'm not just talking about shows in Switzerland I've done other shows except

[<a id="00-05-16">00:05:16</a>]  only exceptions Denmark where I got them they got me when I show show up to many of the European

[<a id="00-05-23">00:05:23</a>]  shows it's kind of like these voyagers or um biologists showing up to some island for the first

[<a id="00-05-30">00:05:30</a>]  time these animals have never seen people before so they don't even know that humans are dangerous

[<a id="00-05-36">00:05:36</a>]  so they're sitting around like I have no idea right because they've been never been discomfort

[<a id="00-05-42">00:05:42</a>]  there's never been conflict they never known pain so they're happy I guess and and they have no fear

[<a id="00-05-50">00:05:50</a>]  but end result is that these are like soft lazy animals you know that that to someone you're

[<a id="00-05-58">00:05:58</a>]  describing is New Zealand to to to reach a higher elevation of anything there have to be some level

[<a id="00-06-06">00:06:06</a>]  of conflict difficulties and struggle right and and and um um you've been to states you've seen

[<a id="00-06-15">00:06:15</a>]  when you when there's a great shows you know you know the level of uh audience participation and

[<a id="00-06-21">00:06:21</a>]  the years of a dedication to provide a kind of show that get the reaction and I'm not mad at any

[<a id="00-06-28">00:06:28</a>]  of the people here I'm just saying they don't know any better and they're so polite they're so polite

[<a id="00-06-33">00:06:33</a>]  to the point it's not helping anyone you see I remember there's places and states where everyone

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  is too nice but because they're so nice none of them know how bad they are that what are you talking

[<a id="00-06-46">00:06:46</a>]  about Wisconsin there's rooms like that I mean there's places like Philly and New York and Boston

[<a id="00-06-53">00:06:53</a>]  there's they're beyond me so they're other extreme sure but but I think it's I it's really rude for

[<a id="00-07-04">00:07:04</a>]  me to show up because I don't know everything about this country that this neutrality attitude

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  is both blessing and a curse I think it's a blessing for the country but elevating individual

[<a id="00-07-17">00:07:17</a>]  strength and greatness it I don't think it's a good thing at all you know and and and I think

[<a id="00-07-23">00:07:23</a>]  look Petrie you know when I when I had that long conversation with Petrie it was on very unpleasant

[<a id="00-07-30">00:07:30</a>]  but he is representative of the northeast attitude um one of my favorite coach in NFL his name is

[<a id="00-07-40">00:07:40</a>]  Bill Parcell he got in trouble for um saying something like a jab attack one of the football

[<a id="00-07-45">00:07:45</a>]  maneuver he's not racist at all but he said something really interesting conflict is actually

[<a id="00-07-51">00:07:51</a>]  necessarily important and it's actually wonderful because when you have conflict it makes clear

[<a id="00-07-56">00:07:56</a>]  the two individual or two groups or two countries clear the air whatever the problem you know it's

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  out in the open and I don't sense that here because I think a lot of people are a little

[<a id="00-08-08">00:08:08</a>]  passive aggressive they don't they don't explain their yeah and I'm only being here like you know

[<a id="00-08-13">00:08:13</a>]  like um because a few times I've been here I just show up a couple days I'm jet lagged I don't really

[<a id="00-08-18">00:08:18</a>]  get the time but you know I've been here I've been in Europe for like a week and um look if you're

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  gonna stay here and do shows and and and audience are comfortable with that that's great then you

[<a id="00-08-29">00:08:29</a>]  don't you don't have to worry about it but if you know what I'm saying like if you're a basketball

[<a id="00-08-35">00:08:35</a>]  player you could play basketball in Europe but if you want to be great you have to get the fuck out

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  of here and go to the place where that shit come from right then you then you really know how good

[<a id="00-08-46">00:08:46</a>]  or bad you are right and so if you do it in American form of art um you don't have black

[<a id="00-08-53">00:08:53</a>]  people here do the people harass and even the black people I mean in Sweden they're very nice

[<a id="00-08-58">00:08:58</a>]  people they're I don't know you know what I'm trying to say here it's not good for spirit to

[<a id="00-09-03">00:09:03</a>]  be this nice so how does this and Mishima you know I love that guy and everybody thinks crazy

[<a id="00-09-10">00:09:10</a>]  but you know I know he's crazy to a point but there's thing that he was saying it's it's it's

[<a id="00-09-15">00:09:15</a>]  true there is this modern malaise the west is suffering from this is this is the guy that

[<a id="00-09-21">00:09:21</a>]  you're talking about at the beginning yeah I mean I call him Japanese uh Ernest Hemingway

[<a id="00-09-27">00:09:27</a>]  that the way uh so what was he what was just he he just did the modern modernism has corrupt Japan

[<a id="00-09-35">00:09:35</a>]  and it's decaying and everybody's happy because they have a modern comfort that they lost some

[<a id="00-09-40">00:09:40</a>]  essence of spirit I'm not I'm not I'm not even talking about fascism but the essence of being a

[<a id="00-09-48">00:09:48</a>]  it's not sexist but being a man yeah yeah this modern shit is not necessarily a good thing for

[<a id="00-09-54">00:09:54</a>]  you I found the quote what he said um or what he wrote in his diary on the 3rd of September 1970

[<a id="00-10-01">00:10:01</a>]  so a couple months leading up to his um seppuku is it called yeah okay uh Japan has lost its

[<a id="00-10-09">00:10:09</a>]  spiritual tradition and instead has become infested with materialism Japan is under the

[<a id="00-10-15">00:10:15</a>]  curse of the green snake the green snake is biting Japan's chest there is no way to escape this curse

[<a id="00-10-23">00:10:23</a>]  so he's screaming he so he's sneaking to the defense man he went so what does he do he goes

[<a id="00-10-30">00:10:30</a>]  to the defense ministry he went to the ministry with his acolytes and they're talking and all of

[<a id="00-10-36">00:10:36</a>]  a sudden he grabbed the minister and took control of the building he's on the balcony yelling and

[<a id="00-10-41">00:10:41</a>]  talking to audience like remember the spirit of Japan and things like that but these modern guys

[<a id="00-10-46">00:10:46</a>]  they're a bunch of tofu eating pussies uh they're laughing at him and they don't understand what

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  he's saying I know when you write people think you're crazy that's the thing yeah eccentric

[<a id="00-10-58">00:10:58</a>]  literally mean someone who didn't believe earth was not a center of the universe because many of

[<a id="00-11-04">00:11:04</a>]  the time people thought earth was center of the universe of center yeah yeah they're not see

[<a id="00-11-09">00:11:09</a>]  everyone who were wrong ridiculed the man who was right a guy like Mishima right so um so yeah this

[<a id="00-11-17">00:11:17</a>]  morning uh uh I was thinking about because I remember it was his day and I had a really weird

[<a id="00-11-22">00:11:22</a>]  um dream and where where where I had this dream there was a school shooting in in all over

[<a id="00-11-30">00:11:30</a>]  switzerland and the reason why is it because I'm not saying they should literally have a real

[<a id="00-11-37">00:11:37</a>]  school shootings but living a life with a little bit of danger and fear I don't think it's a good

[<a id="00-11-46">00:11:46</a>]  thing either this place is too protected well but just so let's just wrap up so what happens

[<a id="00-11-53">00:11:53</a>]  so he yells he grabs a minister and everybody laughed I didn't take his message then he went

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  back into the office he commit seppuku which is one of the most painful way to die because you're

[<a id="00-12-03">00:12:03</a>]  literally getting the blade putting over here go down and you're doing this yourself across your

[<a id="00-12-08">00:12:08</a>]  stomach and up again to show that you have this intestinal string to do this most agonizing pain

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  and have the secondary guide chop your head off and here's the humor comes out the guy didn't do

[<a id="00-12-22">00:12:22</a>]  a good job cutting his head so he had to do two three times to cut his head off but um I know

[<a id="00-12-26">00:12:26</a>]  it's crazy you can't get the stuff yeah but uh it's it's just remember this morning having that

[<a id="00-12-32">00:12:32</a>]  dream and and and then and then um thinking about what he was saying as a kid because my dad said he

[<a id="00-12-39">00:12:39</a>]  was crazy but it's true the things that have any modern world like these people can't even take a

[<a id="00-12-45">00:12:45</a>]  joke that's how sensitive it is so this also goes back to because you did your first show in switzerland

[<a id="00-12-50">00:12:50</a>]  yesterday no I mean it was actually kind of fun because I think there was enough people I mean

[<a id="00-12-56">00:12:56</a>]  that show was actually above average compared to what I did before here because there was people

[<a id="00-13-00">00:13:00</a>]  like they didn't want to laugh because they were with their girlfriend but they didn't laugh but

[<a id="00-13-04">00:13:04</a>]  they were laughing so that's way better than what I what I what I remember but um

[<a id="00-13-10">00:13:10</a>]  just unable to say what how you feel and think and so and and and and you have to worry about

[<a id="00-13-18">00:13:18</a>]  what other people think and and I just I don't know man I just I don't really care for that kind

[<a id="00-13-23">00:13:23</a>]  of environment all right one last question so what's the what is the consequence of what you're

[<a id="00-13-31">00:13:31</a>]  calling out here is that okay we've become well there's no I'm just I'm just ranting

[<a id="00-13-35">00:13:35</a>]  I don't I don't I don't expect any sort of change but but let's say we're all like sheep here uh

[<a id="00-13-42">00:13:42</a>]  what does that mean does that make us easier to manipulate like what's the what's the damage that

[<a id="00-13-48">00:13:48</a>]  having can ask something because you live here yeah if you have to ask average swiss person

[<a id="00-13-55">00:13:55</a>]  do you think they're happy and living a meaningful life

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  uh I know that's unfair but what do you think that would be a question where people would climb up

[<a id="00-14-06">00:14:06</a>]  I mean I've actually I've even do a joke about like where I'm where I'm going uh so does anybody

[<a id="00-14-12">00:14:12</a>]  here know what they're doing have a purpose in life and the way I construct it is deliberately

[<a id="00-14-17">00:14:17</a>]  to get people not to answer and then I tell them well then have some kids because at least you're

[<a id="00-14-22">00:14:22</a>]  doing something um having some purpose I think maybe I can't answer directly but I can say this

[<a id="00-14-29">00:14:29</a>]  one time I was doing a joke about you know we're right on the edge of nuclear war and people are

[<a id="00-14-35">00:14:35</a>]  like oh yeah who cares I'm like and you go like how can you say you don't care it's nuclear war

[<a id="00-14-41">00:14:41</a>]  and they're like yeah but we're in switzerland we're protected and like are you fucking nuts do you understand

[<a id="00-14-47">00:14:47</a>]  what happens when when the bombs start going at that level we're all done there'll be a few

[<a id="00-14-53">00:14:53</a>]  mutants left in a cave underneath the swiss mountains maybe but so that was I was thinking

[<a id="00-14-59">00:14:59</a>]  about this and I was thinking about the show but I was thinking like I can't I can't wait until

[<a id="00-15-04">00:15:04</a>]  Christian visit Austin because once you do shows because I was I was actually kind of glad he did

[<a id="00-15-12">00:15:12</a>]  the show last year in Memphis because it was such a it was such a it wasn't fun show for me to do

[<a id="00-15-20">00:15:20</a>]  and I don't want people to think like I was that awful but when I did Memphis it's like a comfort

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  thing like I only I only know this fucking I've done shows many times in the states you know

[<a id="00-15-31">00:15:31</a>]  but also I want you guys to do shows because they're ruder but for sure they're more stand-up

[<a id="00-15-39">00:15:39</a>]  comedy savvy audience yeah you know so but something that you mentioned before the question

[<a id="00-15-45">00:15:45</a>]  that you wanted to ask the swiss people I find that fascinating because I think this translates

[<a id="00-15-50">00:15:50</a>]  into the sentiment that you have for comedy audiences so there is the world happiness index

[<a id="00-15-58">00:15:58</a>]  and I just pulled up the results for 2024 number one in the world happiness index is Finland

[<a id="00-16-05">00:16:05</a>]  okay okay number one I'm sure Denmark is like top five Denmark Denmark is number two yeah

[<a id="00-16-12">00:16:12</a>]  I could see that and then you have all the other countries with um at georgian cross so Iceland

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  Sweden um followed by number five Israel go here um I mean if you commit in genocide you're always

[<a id="00-16-26">00:16:26</a>]  happy so the Netherlands also not a country known for loud laughter um Norway Luxembourg

[<a id="00-16-33">00:16:33</a>]  and then number nine Switzerland we are one before Australia and but this this is um

[<a id="00-16-41">00:16:41</a>]  they get these figures by I know they do stuff like uh they only have your number for every

[<a id="00-16-49">00:16:49</a>]  10 000 babies born they have a this is the score this is what I this is what what I wanted to get

[<a id="00-16-54">00:16:54</a>]  into because like um if you ask the question are you happy and are you leaving a meaningful life

[<a id="00-17-01">00:17:01</a>]  yeah that's a sentiment the but statistically we have a world happiness index that tells us

[<a id="00-17-08">00:17:08</a>]  that we are happy people now what are they looking at they're looking at real GDP per capita social

[<a id="00-17-15">00:17:15</a>]  support healthy life expectancy freedom of to make life choices so that does not translate into

[<a id="00-17-22">00:17:22</a>]  social mobility by the way what I'm asking is not something you could quantify that's that's

[<a id="00-17-27">00:17:27</a>]  that's the thing um but apparently you can qualify generosity which I find interesting um and the

[<a id="00-17-34">00:17:34</a>]  perception of corruption perception not real corruption yeah perception of corruption so as

[<a id="00-17-39">00:17:39</a>]  long as you don't perceive corruption apparently that makes you happy as a nation and sorry but

[<a id="00-17-45">00:17:45</a>]  another thing that really bugged me then I'll finish um the another reason I was saying this

[<a id="00-17-49">00:17:49</a>]  because Switzerland do reminds me Japan a lot and it really saddens me because I see such a dedicated

[<a id="00-17-55">00:17:55</a>]  groups of people for most part well educated their work ethic is outstanding and service amazing

[<a id="00-18-01">00:18:01</a>]  but it's not a culture that lead individual to pursue their full potential no a meaningful life

[<a id="00-18-08">00:18:08</a>]  and and so no of course if you're from like Africa and you're starving to death of course you they

[<a id="00-18-14">00:18:14</a>]  would love to go to those places I I get it you know but these are like rich enough country but

[<a id="00-18-19">00:18:19</a>]  they're not rich enough to pursue individual happiness it doesn't seem like that I think

[<a id="00-18-23">00:18:23</a>]  I mean the the Switzerland to me has always seemed like like a working form of communism

[<a id="00-18-30">00:18:30</a>]  so it's capitalistic to the front but for example nobody here uh if you if you lose your job you're

[<a id="00-18-38">00:18:38</a>]  well protected yes you technically you don't even need to be homeless basically the only people

[<a id="00-18-44">00:18:44</a>]  living on the street have mental health issues and we are not good at mental health that's for

[<a id="00-18-49">00:18:49</a>]  sure and and so uh and so there is a high emphasis on not putting yourself first yeah now and and

[<a id="00-18-59">00:18:59</a>]  and where I kind of accept that is that is that the the sort of the exceptionalist individualist

[<a id="00-19-05">00:19:05</a>]  point of view yeah you focus on the success and you don't focus on all the other people that failed

[<a id="00-19-11">00:19:11</a>]  and their life is shit because and and to have like an exceptional African there's got to be a

[<a id="00-19-18">00:19:18</a>]  lot of starving dying Africans for this one guy who is genetic I guess I also meant like maybe

[<a id="00-19-24">00:19:24</a>]  there's be part one or part two maybe uh part a and part b because I think there are individual

[<a id="00-19-29">00:19:29</a>]  selfish people in states as well but there are individuals who do something that they get no

[<a id="00-19-34">00:19:34</a>]  financial reward at all but they live meaningful life yeah you know so um I don't know I'm having

[<a id="00-19-43">00:19:43</a>]  a hard time verbalize it because um it always bugs me like when my friends like god you're

[<a id="00-19-49">00:19:49</a>]  lucky you live this way you know you get to go to all those places like nobody's stopping you

[<a id="00-19-53">00:19:53</a>]  to go in those places but if something's important you will do it they just won't

[<a id="00-19-57">00:19:57</a>]  they just make excuse like I live like an idiot but they're just but from my point of view like

[<a id="00-20-04">00:20:04</a>]  wow you know you have three homes married kids uh retirement this and that but they're so unhappy

[<a id="00-20-11">00:20:11</a>]  that's the weird thing that that is something that I I see a lot in in this country where

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  there is an emphasis um there there's a word for it that comes out of religion it's that um

[<a id="00-20-26">00:20:26</a>]  Calvinism taught us that we have to work of the process the protestant work ethic thank you very

[<a id="00-20-32">00:20:32</a>]  much so the work ethic means nothing else that you're a good soldier yeah and I see this a lot

[<a id="00-20-39">00:20:39</a>]  in swiss society in general where it's all about like you follow the fucking rules and you go and

[<a id="00-20-46">00:20:46</a>]  start working you have to be gainfully employed the person who's an artist is even more perceived

[<a id="00-20-54">00:20:54</a>]  an outlier than in in any other culture than yeah that that guy we met yesterday that was his story

[<a id="00-21-01">00:21:01</a>]  you've got there's a swiss guy we met as an artist here he went to america for a while and he was

[<a id="00-21-06">00:21:06</a>]  talking about how he actually said that you can't stand out you get crushed it the interesting thing

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  actually sorry it was interesting guy he made me laugh the other interesting way you brought the

[<a id="00-21-16">00:21:16</a>]  world happiness index also swiss and usually pretty high on the suicide index with so is finland and

[<a id="00-21-23">00:21:23</a>]  this is this is something that baffles me it's like what are we measuring these things about and

[<a id="00-21-29">00:21:29</a>]  the the quantification of happiness seems bizarre in a way because happiness is by and large a

[<a id="00-21-36">00:21:36</a>]  sentiment to me it goes it goes back to the thing when george w bush said um with the war on terror

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  yeah how can you have a war against the feeling yes like it doesn't it doesn't work but it's you

[<a id="00-21-51">00:21:51</a>]  cannot really quantify happiness in that sense it is always a sentiment and i i would argue to go

[<a id="00-21-58">00:21:58</a>]  back to to harry's point um if you would ask swiss people that question yes do you have a happy and

[<a id="00-22-05">00:22:05</a>]  a meaningful life i doubt that you will get the real answer yeah they'll avoid it yeah i think

[<a id="00-22-11">00:22:11</a>]  that's probably true in japan because nobody know what you you have more japanese people showing

[<a id="00-22-17">00:22:17</a>]  octopus porn porn than people asking that question believe me and i mean the myth i have of japan is

[<a id="00-22-24">00:22:24</a>]  that is there is a self-sacrifice like the guy committing harikiri in a way he sacrificed himself

[<a id="00-22-30">00:22:30</a>]  for his for international ideal but also there's this this i just watched shogun so i'm an expert

[<a id="00-22-37">00:22:37</a>]  on japan did you did you watch the new version of the new version i've seen both i've seen both as

[<a id="00-22-44">00:22:44</a>]  well but the new one i thought was fantastic it's fantastic but the main tremendous the main female

[<a id="00-22-49">00:22:49</a>]  character is exactly that she goes she could have such a great life and she chooses for honor and

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  principle and service to to get killed i'm going to make a comment about that and then um that the

[<a id="00-23-04">00:23:04</a>]  calvinist thing it's interesting because japanese and christian but you know i'm ethically korean

[<a id="00-23-08">00:23:08</a>]  i have a lot of korean family members and a lot of them are perspiterian that we're we're break up

[<a id="00-23-15">00:23:15</a>]  it's like elder so it's organization it's a christian organization but it's run by elders

[<a id="00-23-21">00:23:21</a>]  which is compatible to their their culture and and often when i talk to them if some member

[<a id="00-23-27">00:23:27</a>]  of korean community is poor it's because it's predestination some people were determined

[<a id="00-23-33">00:23:33</a>]  some people work really hard so if they're rich because god deemed necessary reward you and so

[<a id="00-23-38">00:23:38</a>]  there's that there's that thinking i had to deal with which is similar to india as well the caste

[<a id="00-23-42">00:23:42</a>]  system yeah and and and in japan um this is such a tough thing because you know um on one hand

[<a id="00-23-50">00:23:50</a>]  when you're visiting it's just it's just amazing place to visit because everyone is sacrificing

[<a id="00-23-55">00:23:55</a>]  for your happiness when you're visiting because you have all the fun without any of the

[<a id="00-24-00">00:24:00</a>]  responsibility as a foreigner yeah you know but it does make me sad because i think so many people

[<a id="00-24-07">00:24:07</a>]  living lower than their potential their willingness make sacrifice i think it's for uh something

[<a id="00-24-15">00:24:15</a>]  spring by ozu there's a movie always is like considered to be one of the four or five great

[<a id="00-24-20">00:24:20</a>]  masters of movie like he did tokyo story which is always ranked top 10 greatest movie yeah the one

[<a id="00-24-26">00:24:26</a>]  my favorite is the spring something i'm not having the title right but it's the one where

[<a id="00-24-32">00:24:32</a>]  a daughter's living with her father and they both make decision to sacrifice to make the other one

[<a id="00-24-38">00:24:38</a>]  happy so she this she decide she want to live with her dad forever but dad decide

[<a id="00-24-45">00:24:45</a>]  to have her marry even though he would like to have her but it was wrong to keep her with him

[<a id="00-24-51">00:24:51</a>]  not marry so they're both making sacrifice not knowing that they're doing it to make others

[<a id="00-24-57">00:24:57</a>]  happy but what they're doing is they're mutually hurting each other by her getting married and

[<a id="00-25-01">00:25:01</a>]  leaving the house and that's a common common thing that happened in japan you know and uh and the last

[<a id="00-25-07">00:25:07</a>]  i want to say is there's this kid named johnny somali you know this guy no he johnny i mean so

[<a id="00-25-16">00:25:16</a>]  he got famous in japan because he's a he's a black kid from arizona he personally went to japan to

[<a id="00-25-23">00:25:23</a>]  harass people so he'll run up to japanese people say hiroshima nagasaki hiroshima nagasaki and shit

[<a id="00-25-28">00:25:28</a>]  like that and he doing all kinds of shit upset people right he went to jail this and that they

[<a id="00-25-33">00:25:33</a>]  eventually deported him then he went to israel where i'm making in my youth hostel because i'm

[<a id="00-25-38">00:25:38</a>]  looking at him like why does this motherfucker looks familiar so we're talking like what's what

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  do you do like oh you know i make money online like what kind of stuff like youtube like what

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  kind of stuff travel like oh like where do you go and as soon as he's in asia like um have you been

[<a id="00-25-55">00:25:55</a>]  to japan then then he laughed and we got then it was him because all my friends hate this guy

[<a id="00-26-00">00:26:00</a>]  now now he went to after getting trouble in israel he went to korea now they might put him

[<a id="00-26-06">00:26:06</a>]  present for 10 years because he went up to this statue where it's called comfort women a comfort

[<a id="00-26-12">00:26:12</a>]  girl and it's a statue representing sexual um yeah degradation of koreans by japanese people

[<a id="00-26-21">00:26:21</a>]  and is making tribute to the bravery and and and the pain suffered by korean women so he's going

[<a id="00-26-27">00:26:27</a>]  there dancing around with t-shirt putting all your like fucking ditty like all over the fucking

[<a id="00-26-33">00:26:33</a>]  statue this you know so he got in trouble got beat up and things like that and and everybody's

[<a id="00-26-39">00:26:39</a>]  a lot of people angry with him and a couple of my friends say how could you be friend with that guy

[<a id="00-26-45">00:26:45</a>]  okay on paper i mean it's awful this is a kind of weird way of thinking but yeah

[<a id="00-26-53">00:26:53</a>]  he was getting so asian americans are angry with this guy going to asian pissing people off

[<a id="00-27-01">00:27:01</a>]  but see they're asian american they're not asians yeah in my opinion i'm asian with u.s citizenship

[<a id="00-27-09">00:27:09</a>]  but i don't consider myself asian american at all so why do i feel a little sympathy for him

[<a id="00-27-15">00:27:15</a>]  when he wants to do that shit in japan american asian that everybody all asian people hit him

[<a id="00-27-20">00:27:20</a>]  there's a significant portion of people who are sending him money you know who who are those

[<a id="00-27-25">00:27:25</a>]  people they're chinese they hate japanese people so they're saying go and cause more problems right

[<a id="00-27-31">00:27:31</a>]  but here's the weird part he still has small percentage japanese people donating money

[<a id="00-27-37">00:27:37</a>]  okay so people ask me why is that that made complete sense to me i i understand why and it

[<a id="00-27-44">00:27:44</a>]  doesn't it doesn't sound very obvious asian american imagine you live in a system you're

[<a id="00-27-51">00:27:51</a>]  not allowed to complain that you really have no choices pretty much that hierarchy is so strong

[<a id="00-27-58">00:27:58</a>]  unless you get really really high grade in testing or you have a extraordinary talent

[<a id="00-28-03">00:28:03</a>]  in performance or something or you come from rich family you're pretty much determined yeah see

[<a id="00-28-10">00:28:10</a>]  you have a priest this is named christianity and there's a guy named dono richie one of the greatest

[<a id="00-28-15">00:28:15</a>]  uh critic and the guy who wrote stuff about japan and if you get criterion dvd of any major japanese

[<a id="00-28-20">00:28:20</a>]  movie dono rich is doing commentary this guy know japan like you cannot believe i mean i learned

[<a id="00-28-27">00:28:27</a>]  stuff about japan from this guy listening you know and one time someone asked him mr richie what is

[<a id="00-28-33">00:28:33</a>]  the religion of japan the the technical term is technical answer is confuciusism buddhism

[<a id="00-28-39">00:28:39</a>]  and shintoism right because they do they do three different things they don't conflict

[<a id="00-28-44">00:28:44</a>]  yeah dono rich you said the religion of japan is being japanese and being japanese you have

[<a id="00-28-51">00:28:51</a>]  to follow these sets of uh instruction like programming yeah but you can't hack that shit

[<a id="00-28-57">00:28:57</a>]  and the reason why they were suffering johnny somali because they were just angry

[<a id="00-29-01">00:29:01</a>]  that they can't protest and do get out of that fucking invisible slavery they're on do you

[<a id="00-29-08">00:29:08</a>]  understand yeah yeah so um place on the taliban women have obviously physical threat and they

[<a id="00-29-15">00:29:15</a>]  can't really do anything but country like this and country like japan it's like those animal got the

[<a id="00-29-21">00:29:21</a>]  thing around their neck color and then they get zapped right they got zapped so much in childhood

[<a id="00-29-28">00:29:28</a>]  about a time they were dope it can no longer zap but they've been trained so they can't go beyond

[<a id="00-29-34">00:29:34</a>]  that you know what i mean and and to me um that's what it seems like to me i mean i could be wrong

[<a id="00-29-40">00:29:40</a>]  so that that would see interesting question and maybe for you christian is if we bring johnny

[<a id="00-29-44">00:29:44</a>]  somali to switzerland what's he gonna do to piss people off so i know he's gonna ask a lot of my

[<a id="00-29-51">00:29:51</a>]  friends but i i i there is some value to chaos in places that is too ordered yeah yeah and stand-up

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  comedy still be supposed to be chaos and every time i watch kids and shows look i'm not saying

[<a id="00-30-05">00:30:05</a>]  you have to be rich or prior but i it drives me crazy because even when they're telling stories

[<a id="00-30-10">00:30:10</a>]  you don't have to get laugh i don't even care about that at least say something interesting

[<a id="00-30-14">00:30:14</a>]  or you know i've been there's plenty of times i get angry or or i listen like you know this person

[<a id="00-30-20">00:30:20</a>]  doesn't have a sentence comedy sentence structure or punchline but that is an interesting original

[<a id="00-30-25">00:30:25</a>]  point of view or he or she have something there yeah it's there's just none of that you know

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  i mean i know when you guys have it you have it you know and um i don't know i just i i know i'm

[<a id="00-30-39">00:30:39</a>]  all over the place but this kind of shit not really this guy's frustrated because when i did

[<a id="00-30-44">00:30:44</a>]  my show adult content you know when i told you like it's a misunderstanding that i thought adult

[<a id="00-30-49">00:30:49</a>]  content mean adult content as in adult happiness and and the stuff that i really cover in pornography

[<a id="00-30-56">00:30:56</a>]  and things like that it's stuff that really people feel uncomfortable but if they're ever to talk

[<a id="00-31-01">00:31:01</a>]  about it or change their ways it's a it's a thing that could lead them to a little bit more meaningful

[<a id="00-31-07">00:31:07</a>]  and happiness i know it's a really funny thing to say from pornography i've seen it but okay now

[<a id="00-31-12">00:31:12</a>]  okay this is kind of making some sense so first of all although it's all over the place that

[<a id="00-31-16">00:31:16</a>]  actually makes sense bringing johnny somali and actually at least it made sense to me

[<a id="00-31-21">00:31:21</a>]  so in a way you're you're bringing the asian version of the pursuit of happiness

[<a id="00-31-27">00:31:27</a>]  is what you're i don't know if i should make it about being asian but you're coming up this this

[<a id="00-31-32">00:31:32</a>]  is the greatest thing about america in my opinion is life liberty and pursuit of happiness not

[<a id="00-31-38">00:31:38</a>]  guarantee of happiness pursuit you can pursue something it doesn't mean it's guaranteed

[<a id="00-31-43">00:31:43</a>]  but the idea that you're allowed to do that because there's been so many places you're not

[<a id="00-31-48">00:31:48</a>]  even allowed to do that literally yeah and i go to countries that they could do it but they don't

[<a id="00-31-53">00:31:53</a>]  because they have a they're invisible slaves yeah i i think we wouldn't be not invisible but

[<a id="00-32-00">00:32:00</a>]  they're slaves they're not they don't know that i think we wouldn't even be able to formulate that

[<a id="00-32-04">00:32:04</a>]  here because i'm not i'm not even providing like i don't know how but i'm just getting general

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  general frustration it's it's an interesting thought like the the comparison with the dog

[<a id="00-32-15">00:32:15</a>]  collar because um when you're when you're never talking about your emotions and you hit on that

[<a id="00-32-22">00:32:22</a>]  before when you're never talking about your emotions when you're never identifying with what

[<a id="00-32-26">00:32:26</a>]  you actually really want but rather identify with the system that you then have to be the the slave

[<a id="00-32-32">00:32:32</a>]  yeah to yeah so to speak it's it's um i didn't mean to make it too heady today you know but i

[<a id="00-32-40">00:32:40</a>]  just didn't want to forget sometimes you have a funny joke you gotta write down you go forget

[<a id="00-32-44">00:32:44</a>]  so i just want to say this one time so at least you have it you know it's out there yeah switzerland

[<a id="00-32-50">00:32:50</a>]  is boring and you know what you're trying to say in the very i mean this is boring sometimes great

[<a id="00-32-55">00:32:55</a>]  too but um but this is a topic so one example that maybe for you is we do i'm sure a ton of

[<a id="00-33-04">00:33:04</a>]  us have done jokes about this but there's a ritual in switzerland if you you don't throw cardboard in

[<a id="00-33-10">00:33:10</a>]  the trash you have to put it outside for recycling huh so if you have cardboard okay and you don't

[<a id="00-33-17">00:33:17</a>]  just chuck it on the street you carefully crush it okay fold it and you have to tie it up in a

[<a id="00-33-23">00:33:23</a>]  string with a bow that can be undone by someone pulling it are you joking no yeah and also they

[<a id="00-33-31">00:33:31</a>]  only pick it up once every two weeks okay and it's a narrow time window so the amount of shit that

[<a id="00-33-38">00:33:38</a>]  has to be coordinated in your life yeah in your time planning so that you can hit the time window

[<a id="00-33-44">00:33:44</a>]  with your cardboard done the right way and this is a this is a national a national ritual it's the

[<a id="00-33-51">00:33:51</a>]  same way that also the bottle recycling i make jokes about because we live we can see bottles

[<a id="00-33-57">00:33:57</a>]  from space using satellites you think we don't have like a solution to automatically sort bottles

[<a id="00-34-04">00:34:04</a>]  but there's this thing with the bottle recycling you you go there you have your aluminium you have

[<a id="00-34-10">00:34:10</a>]  your green bottles your white bottles people take their kids to do this as a saturday afternoon

[<a id="00-34-15">00:34:15</a>]  activity and it's a ritual to say we are contributing to the order of the system here

[<a id="00-34-22">00:34:22</a>]  and i'm doing my part the thing that i think of is uh the sort of propaganda you had in in britain in

[<a id="00-34-30">00:34:30</a>]  world war ii yeah my grandmother was telling me that they did this collection for i think for

[<a id="00-34-37">00:34:37</a>]  maybe aluminium pots or iron pots so everybody gave up all half their cooking gear because they

[<a id="00-34-44">00:34:44</a>]  said we need it for the war effort yeah the bombs for the bombs yeah none of that stuff was used it

[<a id="00-34-50">00:34:50</a>]  was left on giant piles but it was a propaganda technique so that everyone could feel they were

[<a id="00-34-55">00:34:55</a>]  contributing to the war sure and they found after the war like giant mountains of saucepans

[<a id="00-35-01">00:35:01</a>]  so and it's this mentality of we we've all got to do our yeah and that that to me exists here i

[<a id="00-35-10">00:35:10</a>]  just missed carton recycling day by the way yeah and how do you feel about that you feel like

[<a id="00-35-15">00:35:15</a>]  shit because now my basement is fucked exactly and don't you feel that at some level your life

[<a id="00-35-20">00:35:20</a>]  slightly falling apart you don't have i don't i don't want you guys to think i hate this country

[<a id="00-35-24">00:35:24</a>]  i think this country is great oh yeah i think japan's great too it's just it's just that i mean

[<a id="00-35-29">00:35:29</a>]  you know i mean on the other hand i said all this stuff and then as you were telling me another thing

[<a id="00-35-34">00:35:34</a>]  that popped me up popped up is even shitty job japanese take pride in things like that i was

[<a id="00-35-39">00:35:39</a>]  really impressed by yeah yeah yeah and um i think that that is also something that's similar here

[<a id="00-35-46">00:35:46</a>]  like the majority of people despite the fucking meaningless work that they would do they would be

[<a id="00-35-50">00:35:50</a>]  proud of the meaningless work that they are doing yeah so i mean i i i know i'm all over the place

[<a id="00-35-55">00:35:55</a>]  but i got a little um i don't know what the fuck was going on it just i was just walking back where

[<a id="00-36-02">00:36:02</a>]  i really enjoyed the show last night i really liked that kid because the russian kid he was so

[<a id="00-36-07">00:36:07</a>]  he was so diligent and he was so enthusiastic not like that you know like uh show busy like

[<a id="00-36-13">00:36:13</a>]  people in la no he genuinely want to go so i really appreciated that and i appreciate an

[<a id="00-36-19">00:36:19</a>]  audience it was a fun show it was a good show um but um i don't know it i always it worked these

[<a id="00-36-27">00:36:27</a>]  questions yeah my family you know you know when people say it's better to do it and ask for

[<a id="00-36-32">00:36:32</a>]  forgiveness later on i feel like it's better for me to say it even if i make somebody mad because

[<a id="00-36-36">00:36:36</a>]  if i don't say it and i've been said sometimes it might harm more because i think so many times

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  people ask me like how do you live like that there's another one i don't know how do you live

[<a id="00-36-47">00:36:47</a>]  like that yeah that's fair enough you have so much money and stuff but like united like i have a

[<a id="00-36-54">00:36:54</a>]  couple friends like that like they have so much stuff and money they never have to work but they

[<a id="00-36-58">00:36:58</a>]  work anyway like they don't own things things on them like they have to do all this shit because

[<a id="00-37-04">00:37:04</a>]  they create this narrative now they got a wife and kids and they're kind of trapped and i think it's

[<a id="00-37-09">00:37:09</a>]  so funny that i have so little money compared to all my friends but obviously i'm 90 more

[<a id="00-37-13">00:37:13</a>]  freer than those guys and i i done stuff i mean i'm actually no money um but i i i had a privilege

[<a id="00-37-23">00:37:23</a>]  being part of something a lot of like those accidental meaningful things you know and i'm

[<a id="00-37-27">00:37:27</a>]  seeing seeing things and and done things and when places like if you go back thousand years and all

[<a id="00-37-35">00:37:35</a>]  that my ancestors all the people were in my family tree they were not they've never done any of them

[<a id="00-37-42">00:37:42</a>]  yeah there's no way they're all born in small village they can't leave they die there yeah and

[<a id="00-37-47">00:37:47</a>]  repeat that for a thousand years really and maybe what i would just there's one story you might be

[<a id="00-37-54">00:37:54</a>]  interested i remember this in the i was like the fifth year i was in switzerland i'm still figuring

[<a id="00-37-59">00:37:59</a>]  it out yeah i'm still feeling isolated i don't know many people and i'm trying to fit into the

[<a id="00-38-06">00:38:06</a>]  system and there's a story on the news about this swiss family um who the neighbors thought were very

[<a id="00-38-14">00:38:14</a>]  successful it happened somewhere around zurich uh i think maybe around clortom near the airport so

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  they had the house the car they had two kids and then and then and then they then the parents killed

[<a id="00-38-28">00:38:28</a>]  the kids and themselves and it turned out that they were massively in debt and they couldn't

[<a id="00-38-33">00:38:33</a>]  keep up their lives this wasn't like a zurich or something this was around zurich yeah and

[<a id="00-38-37">00:38:37</a>]  to me that story number one that they killed their own kids yeah what the fuck and and because those

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  and then the other thing is that this yeah your your things own you this is like an extreme form

[<a id="00-38-51">00:38:51</a>]  of that like they took the the identity the shame all the stuff because they're now in debt they're

[<a id="00-38-57">00:38:57</a>]  gonna have to lose everything let them to kill like yeah yeah first of all i don't agree with

[<a id="00-39-04">00:39:04</a>]  what they did but in a sick logic i kind of understand too it's not like it's not that they

[<a id="00-39-10">00:39:10</a>]  can't file bankruptcy it's just that they're in social class and friends and colleagues and things

[<a id="00-39-14">00:39:14</a>]  like that they're part of like community to be exposed that you were living beyond your mean or

[<a id="00-39-23">00:39:23</a>]  living in the way that you're maintaining certain social club i don't know whatever it is i don't

[<a id="00-39-27">00:39:27</a>]  know they did but but but that must have been devastating to them but they're so many fascinating

[<a id="00-39-33">00:39:33</a>]  we don't need to go at this angle but there was a point where i moved out from my family yeah it

[<a id="00-39-38">00:39:38</a>]  was like living in a shitty place yeah up in north syria shitty for switzerland and and so it was a

[<a id="00-39-44">00:39:44</a>]  point of like wow like i'm here um what was i i'm almost 40 i fucked my life like everything ended

[<a id="00-39-52">00:39:52</a>]  in the wrong place yeah this is not why i like i've been working the whole time i did the family

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  thing it's all fucked and now yeah now i'm just going to be paying alimony and um uh and actually

[<a id="00-40-05">00:40:05</a>]  that began from the moment that i realized it's all fucked and then i thought wait i'm still alive

[<a id="00-40-11">00:40:11</a>]  yes that was where a whole bunch of stuff just got better and life got more fun leading eventually

[<a id="00-40-18">00:40:18</a>]  the comedy yeah leading to because yeah it's just like a point where you're like who gives a fuck

[<a id="00-40-24">00:40:24</a>]  about this stuff if you're alive life is the greatest experience at this point actually i

[<a id="00-40-30">00:40:30</a>]  want to i want to lead that back a little bit to the story that we have started with you yes yoshi

[<a id="00-40-35">00:40:35</a>]  because um you your your search for for meaning um is something that i find fascinating whenever

[<a id="00-40-43">00:40:43</a>]  whenever we talk because you have a tendency to boil things down quite quite quickly um to

[<a id="00-40-49">00:40:49</a>]  to its essence in a way um and last time we spoke uh we were discussing how your mom kidnapped you

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  and your brother yeah for the second time and moved to the states um and you kind of hinted

[<a id="00-41-05">00:41:05</a>]  on the fact that you were in the states in a new place um and you were already a young

[<a id="00-41-11">00:41:11</a>]  teenager at this point um i'll answer but just quick comments so we'll move on one one other

[<a id="00-41-18">00:41:18</a>]  thing that really helped me the reason that they're meaning i'm not a philosopher you know

[<a id="00-41-22">00:41:22</a>]  i mean i read is raises edge and all that i read all that a bunch of basics of philosophy stuff

[<a id="00-41-28">00:41:28</a>]  it's not that it's just my family made a point when i was growing up you just have to get good

[<a id="00-41-34">00:41:34</a>]  education get a good job you have money then you'll be happy with the rest of life yeah it's

[<a id="00-41-38">00:41:38</a>]  nonsense i mean it's a biggest lie it can be if you have the right personality but it's it's it's

[<a id="00-41-44">00:41:44</a>]  it's not necessarily true it's not necessarily true now the best outcome is you achieve that

[<a id="00-41-48">00:41:48</a>]  shit then you're like and then what yeah but we've got to give this man around because he did a

[<a id="00-41-53">00:41:53</a>]  beautiful segue just saying that was one of the greatest segues and two it's not the asians anymore

[<a id="00-41-59">00:41:59</a>]  hard working it's just that in my theory the reason most asian people work really hard they

[<a id="00-42-04">00:42:04</a>]  say they're doing it for their family and kids i don't really necessarily believe that hundred

[<a id="00-42-08">00:42:08</a>]  percent i think they work really hard because they don't want to deal with their own personal

[<a id="00-42-11">00:42:11</a>]  problems see that's a that's a form of escapism yes so if they work it gives the cover like being

[<a id="00-42-18">00:42:18</a>]  socially uh respectful and taking care of family but what they're doing is they work really hard

[<a id="00-42-22">00:42:22</a>]  and they turn around their kids i'm suffering all this for your future happiness whatever

[<a id="00-42-27">00:42:27</a>]  so they're basically deferring their own personal happiness by making these kids miserable

[<a id="00-42-34">00:42:34</a>]  you know what i mean so then it becomes a fucking yeah this is something i told you people trickle

[<a id="00-42-38">00:42:38</a>]  down of misery you know so um but okay let's go let's go back to your this is where we are in a

[<a id="00-42-45">00:42:45</a>]  timeline you are uh in america now yes my mom kidnapped i'm studying fourth grade again in the

[<a id="00-42-53">00:42:53</a>]  states and then i thought when my mother did it did it the second time she said my parents are

[<a id="00-42-59">00:42:59</a>]  divorced and i thought she's gonna stay but no she decided to go back to japan for some reason

[<a id="00-43-03">00:43:03</a>]  wait hang on so this is 1980 march okay so but the logistics interest me here um i've never said that

[<a id="00-43-13">00:43:13</a>]  before um so you arrive in america you don't know a word of english at this point none you're getting

[<a id="00-43-22">00:43:22</a>]  sent into fourth grade how the fuck does that work what do you mean i mean i think within a

[<a id="00-43-27">00:43:27</a>]  four or five days arrive in states they took me to school what happens in school you don't understand

[<a id="00-43-33">00:43:33</a>]  a thing i don't understand the thing at all and they were confused and they just said i'm from

[<a id="00-43-37">00:43:37</a>]  japan and two i forgot the teacher's name but my fourth grade teacher was actually japanese america

[<a id="00-43-45">00:43:45</a>]  so really that kind of helped me a lot did she but but was she able to explain the curriculum

[<a id="00-43-50">00:43:50</a>]  in japanese to you or did she make no you just sit there like they're just talking you don't know

[<a id="00-43-53">00:43:53</a>]  what's going on at all so for the first what three months you all here is just so much loud

[<a id="00-44-00">00:44:00</a>]  march 19th march 1982 late may early june or middle of the june finished fourth grade

[<a id="00-44-06">00:44:06</a>]  um i'm just sitting there i have no idea what's going on now when they give me math problems i

[<a id="00-44-11">00:44:11</a>]  was way ahead of them because math is japan was so much hair you know at that point fucking age

[<a id="00-44-18">00:44:18</a>]  at that point at that point at fourth grade i was probably like seventh or eighth grade level i think

[<a id="00-44-24">00:44:24</a>]  right yeah but other than that you know i'm like i'm sitting there i have to write alphabet i've

[<a id="00-44-29">00:44:29</a>]  never seen these letters before so they're just making me do saying a lot of time i'm just copying

[<a id="00-44-33">00:44:33</a>]  stuff and like i don't know what's going on you know so they just dropped me out we fly we land

[<a id="00-44-40">00:44:40</a>]  in march 13th 1980 with less than a week i'm in school and within 10 days my mother went back to

[<a id="00-44-48">00:44:48</a>]  japan i'm living with my my mother's older sister second older sister and the white guy who was her

[<a id="00-44-54">00:44:54</a>]  boyfriend like an uncle i'm living with them and i have to relearn everything because things that

[<a id="00-45-00">00:45:00</a>]  were acceptable in japan i'm getting you can't do those i learned the hard way and then i and things

[<a id="00-45-06">00:45:06</a>]  like that you're not supposed to do it's acceptable in american way right so it was very confusing me

[<a id="00-45-12">00:45:12</a>]  and my brother were just confused like i i didn't understand what was going on and who did you talk

[<a id="00-45-17">00:45:17</a>]  to in that period just my brother just your brother and in what little i could learn from other kids

[<a id="00-45-22">00:45:22</a>]  but it took a long i mean i don't know i i imagine if they grab you matter when i say

[<a id="00-45-27">00:45:27</a>]  you know china tomorrow they take you and like you're you're going to school you know

[<a id="00-45-32">00:45:32</a>]  ching chung elementary school whatever

[<a id="00-45-35">00:45:35</a>]  i'm asian and they all sound like king chung so i i can't imagine like a white person like

[<a id="00-45-43">00:45:43</a>]  what does it sound like right yeah i'm just being honest i told when i was living in scandinavia

[<a id="00-45-51">00:45:51</a>]  uh 2012 for three months i told my friend nadir funny fact i stand in swedish community like

[<a id="00-45-58">00:45:58</a>]  there's no way i could live here even if i could learn to speak the language he said he asked me

[<a id="00-46-02">00:46:02</a>]  why because those fucking stupid scandinavian alphabet with like line across the o or two dots

[<a id="00-46-08">00:46:08</a>]  and shit fuck that i'm not doing that shit and that's it so as a guy who grew up with the japanese

[<a id="00-46-13">00:46:13</a>]  i know but i have to do the alphabet shit like you've already done it twice i'm i'm i don't i

[<a id="00-46-18">00:46:18</a>]  don't know what they were saying and they teaching shit so differently and when you make you're not

[<a id="00-46-25">00:46:25</a>]  in japan you're not supposed to make eye contact because you're questioning authority but in the

[<a id="00-46-28">00:46:28</a>]  west you if you don't make eye contact they think you're lying you're shifty everything i have to

[<a id="00-46-33">00:46:33</a>]  relearn you know and like 1980 in navy town brown matthew where the battleship missouri's there where

[<a id="00-46-39">00:46:39</a>]  japanese side surrendered there's so many people who survived world war ii living in there it was

[<a id="00-46-44">00:46:44</a>]  the worst name to have at the time living there it's a navy town dude brampton washington brammer

[<a id="00-46-50">00:46:50</a>]  tune there's brammer germany you know what i'm saying there's like a it's it's it's a navy town

[<a id="00-46-56">00:46:56</a>]  they don't like japs even other asian kids are calling me japs and i don't know the word japan

[<a id="00-47-02">00:47:02</a>]  because proper term for japan is nippon so i'm just like what's jab i don't i don't know what

[<a id="00-47-08">00:47:08</a>]  that means and i told you this group a couple of days a couple years later i'm in chicago washington

[<a id="00-47-12">00:47:12</a>]  but i didn't speak or writing some english black guy say remember i told you say hey an n word

[<a id="00-47-19">00:47:19</a>]  i've never heard that word before so i thought that kind of guy groovy something something fun

[<a id="00-47-24">00:47:24</a>]  right so i just put it back thinking i was being friendly this guy had that look like i've seen

[<a id="00-47-29">00:47:29</a>]  that look and people usually get punched in the face i've read so i'm learning i am literally

[<a id="00-47-33">00:47:33</a>]  learning every day like i don't know i have to relearn everything right yeah when when you're a

[<a id="00-47-42">00:47:42</a>]  graduating you're coming closer to to graduation like you mentioned before graduate from a high

[<a id="00-47-46">00:47:46</a>]  school yeah we we i want to get there because like your your school time like you have to learn

[<a id="00-47-54">00:47:54</a>]  a lot and um like a completely new culture and language and all that sort of stuff yeah but also

[<a id="00-47-59">00:47:59</a>]  you said you were acting up i want to before you graduated what does acting up entail for you

[<a id="00-48-07">00:48:07</a>]  i mean i'm not lying you know i think they caught me like once or twice see

[<a id="00-48-14">00:48:14</a>]  my brother had way less interaction with his dad so our dad was more like an abstract idea for my

[<a id="00-48-24">00:48:24</a>]  dad my brother yeah sure so when my dad passed away in 2003 i don't remember the way he said it

[<a id="00-48-31">00:48:31</a>]  but the way he said it was it was there was a huge distance between him like he know that's his dad

[<a id="00-48-38">00:48:38</a>]  he's not happy that he's dead but there was not like a warm history because he was too young

[<a id="00-48-43">00:48:43</a>]  i had that you know so so um i i think my aunt and my mom maybe caught me crying because i just

[<a id="00-48-52">00:48:52</a>]  i just went through that second and third grade where we got kidnapped and we live in an apartment

[<a id="00-48-57">00:48:57</a>]  without a dad that was a little weird because every but this is 70s too and most people are

[<a id="00-49-02">00:49:02</a>]  married for life you know so it's already strange like we leave middle of the school year appear in

[<a id="00-49-08">00:49:08</a>]  this apartment different from osaka and i had to make all kinds of love because that's what mom tells

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  me and i don't see my dad and finally doing this then there's a period for like 11 months or

[<a id="00-49-19">00:49:19</a>]  something where i thought everything was back to normal then we're doing this shit but now i mean

[<a id="00-49-23">00:49:23</a>]  six seven thousand six thousand miles away in a culture where i don't understand any of it

[<a id="00-49-28">00:49:28</a>]  and and and i know a lot of people who immigrate to usa they love that and and they're coming

[<a id="00-49-34">00:49:34</a>]  they're arriving to a wonderful country but japan is not a bad place and my biggest grievance is

[<a id="00-49-41">00:49:41</a>]  not having dad and cartoon shows and toys are way better in japan like i don't i'm coming to a

[<a id="00-49-48">00:49:48</a>]  country with like shit toys and shit shows you know and then and then puberty is no but that's

[<a id="00-49-56">00:49:56</a>]  still at four or five i mean really three four five years away from that you know okay you gotta

[<a id="00-50-01">00:50:01</a>]  remember i was like four ten ten years old you know ten years old but you've seen plenty asian

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  girls like they're 28 but they look like 14 you know like you know we're so slow but i'm trying

[<a id="00-50-14">00:50:14</a>]  to ask so i mean what do you wait okay maybe we're jumping around you're jumping so but what

[<a id="00-50-19">00:50:19</a>]  are you thinking about these these american chicks i mean i think i was too young to think like

[<a id="00-50-27">00:50:27</a>]  in that light but i you know you gotta i was like i can't believe people have blue eyes

[<a id="00-50-33">00:50:33</a>]  and then you know like green because my my grandmother told me that time i saw foreigners on tv

[<a id="00-50-40">00:50:40</a>]  i wasn't sure if that's real because i've never seen one i know it's kind of dumb thing but

[<a id="00-50-46">00:50:46</a>]  everyone looks like me in japan right so like i thought they were black

[<a id="00-50-54">00:50:54</a>]  mediterranean white people were as real as gazella was you know the monster do you know what i mean

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  they're on tv so i didn't think it's real and i asked my grandmother about that i'm like

[<a id="00-51-04">00:51:04</a>]  how come they have like blue and green eyes if they're real right you know what my grandmother

[<a id="00-51-08">00:51:08</a>]  told me because those people eat cats nice that's what that's cats have those kind of colors right

[<a id="00-51-15">00:51:15</a>]  yeah i said what kind of motherfucking filthy animal that eat cat like who does that to cat

[<a id="00-51-20">00:51:20</a>]  because i'm not chinese we don't you know i mean like who eat animals like that so i thought i

[<a id="00-51-25">00:51:25</a>]  thought then did you make did you make a friend so how long did you wait oh before i said before

[<a id="00-51-32">00:51:32</a>]  that so eventually i did see white guys in my neighborhood a couple years after that

[<a id="00-51-36">00:51:36</a>]  they're riding bicycles they have in japan that is yeah and then they have white shirt and tie

[<a id="00-51-42">00:51:42</a>]  they're Mormons obviously right my fucking bitch of grandmother said if you see these people they

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  can feel pain that's what she said right so yes so when we saw white people i was like what the fuck

[<a id="00-51-59">00:51:59</a>]  right so i had my brother and cousin distract one of them and one guy they were talking i ran up i

[<a id="00-52-06">00:52:06</a>]  touched one in shoulder and arm make sure they're real i ran back and hide right because that i

[<a id="00-52-11">00:52:11</a>]  didn't know they're real right so i thought okay so imagine i touch one is like a hand like back

[<a id="00-52-19">00:52:19</a>]  shoulders i'm oh my god they're real i ran back right then because my grandmother said they can't

[<a id="00-52-24">00:52:24</a>]  feel pain so i told all the kids to get rocks right so they were they went to house i don't

[<a id="00-52-33">00:52:33</a>]  know what they were doing obviously they were trying to convert so we're hiding soon as they're

[<a id="00-52-37">00:52:37</a>]  driving riding bicycle did i told all the kids to throw rock they started pouting that's my idea

[<a id="00-52-44">00:52:44</a>]  and like this lying bitch they feel pain all right

[<a id="00-52-47">00:52:47</a>]  so stuff like that i'm a stupid guy stupid kid but like i was always curious like why did they

[<a id="00-52-58">00:52:58</a>]  do it that way i just wondered like it okay so if you turn that story on its head and you have to

[<a id="00-53-03">00:53:03</a>]  talk to the guy his name was probably jeffrey or something boring jebediah jebediah from utah

[<a id="00-53-10">00:53:10</a>]  salomon exactly who who flew in uh to osaka because he wants to convert yeah convert people

[<a id="00-53-18">00:53:18</a>]  and then it's like you know what and then this thing happened there's this kid that ran up to me

[<a id="00-53-22">00:53:22</a>]  touch me in the shoulder and next minute they started fucking pelting us no he wouldn't use

[<a id="00-53-27">00:53:27</a>]  phone no no i mean that see you guys you guys are well educated pelting native americans

[<a id="00-53-34">00:53:34</a>]  americans once knew that you're right that's such a perfect word you guys are so smart yeah you know

[<a id="00-53-41">00:53:41</a>]  so i i got in trouble for shit like that all the time because i was so curious mama but it's

[<a id="00-53-48">00:53:48</a>]  partly because you know you're being fucked with at home so you got to figure the shit out for

[<a id="00-53-52">00:53:52</a>]  yourself i guess you go yeah i don't really stay home because i think you're very observant check

[<a id="00-53-57">00:53:57</a>]  out the brain on this guy yes because they're dirt you don't want to see your mom trying to

[<a id="00-54-01">00:54:01</a>]  stab your dad with a knife i've seen them multiple times and uh yeah well there's there's that but

[<a id="00-54-07">00:54:07</a>]  then there's also like grandmother who you can't trust so you got to finish she's lying grandmother

[<a id="00-54-14">00:54:14</a>]  you know i just didn't like any of that stuff and oh my god i had a neighbor i'm telling you

[<a id="00-54-23">00:54:23</a>]  it's not cool to call white trash but if you do it then prepare to call your

[<a id="00-54-27">00:54:27</a>]  others black trash brown trash yellow trash even as a kid this was like not right

[<a id="00-54-36">00:54:36</a>]  we had like tourists in like namba place or something

[<a id="00-54-42">00:54:42</a>]  it's like a fancy it's like a touristy place even in 70s i saw this fucking white i mean yellow trash

[<a id="00-54-50">00:54:50</a>]  you know how um this is something like we're so old but

[<a id="00-54-56">00:54:56</a>]  you dress well you have a friendly demeanor you're younger than us uh you're a charming guy

[<a id="00-55-04">00:55:04</a>]  you know so i'm sure there's a social hammer social standing sitting where you know um

[<a id="00-55-10">00:55:10</a>]  you you're working somebody's rich work and then for you might meet somebody fancy where you you

[<a id="00-55-18">00:55:18</a>]  know how to greet yourself and like a gentleman sure and perhaps when she put your hand and kiss

[<a id="00-55-22">00:55:22</a>]  her hand and things like that very charming you know just those fancy dance at the young

[<a id="00-55-27">00:55:27</a>]  teenage at vienna right i don't know yeah the ball ball and things like that i could see you doing

[<a id="00-55-32">00:55:32</a>]  that this motherfucker i'm eight years i saw that he just grabbed some random white lady's hand

[<a id="00-55-41">00:55:41</a>]  and not even like a kiss because he didn't even probably this motherfucker licked her hand like a

[<a id="00-55-49">00:55:49</a>]  dog yes i saw that dude that's my 1977 and he had one of the look almost like a looky like a tongue

[<a id="00-55-59">00:55:59</a>]  like that like i'm a junkie even at the like there's no way that's the proper way doing this

[<a id="00-56-06">00:56:06</a>]  this motherfucker i said this motherfucker right so i've seen shit like that because when you're poor

[<a id="00-56-13">00:56:13</a>]  growing up those kind of environment you know my luck i was lucky enough that i had some relative

[<a id="00-56-20">00:56:20</a>]  overseas so i got kind of used to traveling you know but it's like that famous playdoh thing

[<a id="00-56-26">00:56:26</a>]  right that the cave thing where everybody see the real thing with the fire so they create this

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  shadow on the wall everybody chain looking at the wall thing the shadow is the real thing

[<a id="00-56-37">00:56:37</a>]  a lot of people live like that you know what sells at these days they're not even chained

[<a id="00-56-41">00:56:41</a>]  they could see the real thing they voluntarily live like a slave even when they have option

[<a id="00-56-46">00:56:46</a>]  now if you don't have option you're stuck in some shit country then i don't feel i feel sympathy

[<a id="00-56-52">00:56:52</a>]  and i understand what drives me crazy when people have so much options to do stuff but they're

[<a id="00-56-59">00:56:59</a>]  afraid they're they're they're raised they're raised in the way that they're afraid to do things

[<a id="00-57-05">00:57:05</a>]  or um they took that fighting spirit away from them that's what i don't like yeah if if you

[<a id="00-57-13">00:57:13</a>]  have a shitty job according to me shitty job but you dedicate yourself and you're proud then you're

[<a id="00-57-18">00:57:18</a>]  not that person that i'm worried about do you understand what i'm saying here but then it's so

[<a id="00-57-23">00:57:23</a>]  i mean this is going to zag into a different direction but just yeah yeah so with when people

[<a id="00-57-29">00:57:29</a>]  are self-oppressing themselves like that because they're afraid yeah then it come you can't suppress

[<a id="00-57-36">00:57:36</a>]  human nature so it comes out in something like like porn is that but you say you hate that was

[<a id="00-57-42">00:57:42</a>]  that part was that part of the fascination of working in porn for you i mean i mean i mean

[<a id="00-57-47">00:57:47</a>]  i went in for money but what i got in return was naked truth right so when you pervert and train

[<a id="00-57-55">00:57:55</a>]  like a pervert well played no no but when you train like a program pornographer you notice

[<a id="00-58-00">00:58:00</a>]  something that civilians don't see like i start working at evil angel the week eyes wide shot

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  premiere even on the day right and well and i'll finish this there's a there's a point for that

[<a id="00-58-15">00:58:15</a>]  because that's that movie i learned a lot a lot from that movie and and and and i believe that

[<a id="00-58-22">00:58:22</a>]  movie was the most meaningful movie to cover just like it's a very meaningful movie to me

[<a id="00-58-26">00:58:26</a>]  and and you were telling me about the podcast where they're talking about a lot of conspiracy

[<a id="00-58-30">00:58:30</a>]  stuff yeah i'm not saying it's not true i'm sure there's a lot of that stuff there too

[<a id="00-58-33">00:58:33</a>]  but when i saw that movie what was so interesting

[<a id="00-58-43">00:58:43</a>]  everybody bought the whole orgy thing in the movie but see as a

[<a id="00-58-48">00:58:48</a>]  185 pervert iq person that orgy is a idea of like average person who's never worked in sex

[<a id="00-59-02">00:59:02</a>]  business to deal with that kind of world there it's their idea of orgy right but to me somebody

[<a id="00-59-08">00:59:08</a>]  who is pornographer and work with pornography we let that scene we laugh because it that's not

[<a id="00-59-14">00:59:14</a>]  pornographic at all i mean average person to get it but to us it's not pornographic in fact it almost

[<a id="00-59-20">00:59:20</a>]  seemed like it was a performance arts and dancing then years later when i read i was 100 accurate

[<a id="00-59-27">00:59:27</a>]  when kubrick hired and start casting these people originally they were saying that this is going to

[<a id="00-59-32">00:59:32</a>]  be like a dance scene and they were training these people for eight months and every eight months

[<a id="00-59-37">00:59:37</a>]  they were yeah yeah eight or not and maybe even longer and every every time they're getting closer

[<a id="00-59-42">00:59:42</a>]  closer filming it's getting more risky and risque and eventually they told them it's a scene for

[<a id="00-59-47">00:59:47</a>]  kubrick movie they didn't know oh they didn't know they didn't even know they didn't even they

[<a id="00-59-52">00:59:52</a>]  didn't even know now to me the most sexy part the hot scene is actually it's a scene between nicole

[<a id="01-00-00">01:00:00</a>]  kipman and tom cruise see the orgy scene is what average people would be fool thinking that's orgy

[<a id="01-00-07">01:00:07</a>]  but pornography is a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah yeah and the reason why eyes wide shut is so amazing and

[<a id="01-00-15">01:00:15</a>]  meaningful to me and i'm not discounting all the conspiracy i believe they probably put it in there

[<a id="01-00-19">01:00:19</a>]  two things can be true it's just that it's a wonderful film it's a really optimistic film

[<a id="01-00-27">01:00:27</a>]  because kubrick was married three times uh he was kind of fraudulent he was a young man uh

[<a id="01-00-35">01:00:35</a>]  it was covered in that movie um what was the um 19th 18th century european

[<a id="01-00-42">01:00:42</a>]  movie where a guy was a liar and fraudulent he was fought in a seven-year war uh i'm forgetting

[<a id="01-00-49">01:00:49</a>]  the name of the title of the movie um it's such a very very linden the main character is fraudulent

[<a id="01-00-58">01:00:58</a>]  he's getting trouble and eventually his dishonesty and inability to be true to himself and do the

[<a id="01-01-04">01:01:04</a>]  right thing it's a disaster which reflect kubrick's first marriage but second was most toxic marriage

[<a id="01-01-12">01:01:12</a>]  and he was most sadist which is covered in the movie go shining which is a very toxic merit you

[<a id="01-01-17">01:01:17</a>]  know when you're trying to ask your [ __ ] wife it's not a good marriage but third one the marriage

[<a id="01-01-22">01:01:22</a>]  he had with his wife the love of his life um is covered in eyes wide shut because in the movie

[<a id="01-01-31">01:01:31</a>]  nicole cameron's character shocked tom cruise character bill and alice that women can have

[<a id="01-01-36">01:01:36</a>]  fantasy too and i was willing to leave our marriage and our our daughter to be with somebody else

[<a id="01-01-42">01:01:42</a>]  the reason why i think this is amazing at the end of the movie tom cruise got so upset by that

[<a id="01-01-47">01:01:47</a>]  uh fantasy and mission that he does his his own fantasy journey where all the kind of [ __ ]

[<a id="01-01-54">01:01:54</a>]  happened to him and it was kind of semi-disaster i mean it's kind of funny when a guy that looked

[<a id="01-01-59">01:01:59</a>]  like tom cruise that couldn't get laid in new york city but nevertheless at the end of it he realized

[<a id="01-02-04">01:02:04</a>]  he was upset with her with her fantasy he tried to his fantasy but he survived at the end of the

[<a id="01-02-10">01:02:10</a>]  movie she said you know what we should be thankful because we went through this horrible thing we're

[<a id="01-02-15">01:02:15</a>]  both completely honest we're on the same page and we survived this thing we still love each other

[<a id="01-02-23">01:02:23</a>]  and it's kind of is the marriage that cooper can he's a hollywood director but he doesn't want to

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  have anything with hollywood because fantasy is dangerous he's one of the few director never

[<a id="01-02-33">01:02:33</a>]  cheated on his wife wonderful father wonderful husband it's amazing somebody who was able to

[<a id="01-02-38">01:02:38</a>]  create so many amazing movies so i had so much opportunity to do anything that he wanted in

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  that fantasy world true enough to do it have a meaningful life with his wife i have a loving life

[<a id="01-02-51">01:02:51</a>]  and kids to me he he is the artist of a highest degree because he create create great art that

[<a id="01-03-00">01:03:00</a>]  learned the lessons of those art and actually lived those lessons and lived a happy meaningful

[<a id="01-03-05">01:03:05</a>]  life and that movie in my opinion is a tribute to his wife i don't give a fuck about the tribute

[<a id="01-03-10">01:03:10</a>]  conspiracy and stuff i'm sure that's true but it's an incredible film here's a thought so what

[<a id="01-03-16">01:03:16</a>]  they're saying with this whole journey that tom cruise does is to kind of cat because he's almost

[<a id="01-03-21">01:03:21</a>]  like he's jealous of his wife of course because he didn't know that women could have a uh so

[<a id="01-03-26">01:03:26</a>]  capacity for fantasy is this does this resonate with you with porn it's like because porn is

[<a id="01-03-32">01:03:32</a>]  largely watched by men watched by men most likely uh lonely and we're doing it because we're jealous

[<a id="01-03-39">01:03:39</a>]  of women's fantasy ultimately like that's the underlying driver would you would you say that

[<a id="01-03-47">01:03:47</a>]  and and then it leads to we can't have their level of and also like a male orgasm is it and

[<a id="01-03-53">01:03:53</a>]  you're done yeah and and for women they can have multiple orgasm go look i i don't want to get too

[<a id="01-03-59">01:03:59</a>]  too detailed on sex because i think at the end of the day in my personal opinion sex is overrated

[<a id="01-04-06">01:04:06</a>]  yeah and the amount of effort and in the grief it brings it's but i i think what i think what i

[<a id="01-04-13">01:04:13</a>]  think i've been pursuing is not so much pornography but people have fantasy because something's not

[<a id="01-04-20">01:04:20</a>]  right awry in their life right so you manufacture this matter involved is another one like my mother

[<a id="01-04-25">01:04:25</a>]  she hate she she hated her life she manufactured a scenario hopefully that she could live a happy

[<a id="01-04-32">01:04:32</a>]  life it just that does that unhealthy fantasy brought disaster at the end of the movie and she

[<a id="01-04-38">01:04:38</a>]  hurt her kid in a book so people have fantasy look harmless fantasy we all have it that's okay

[<a id="01-04-43">01:04:43</a>]  but whether this venn diagram about serial killers or terrorists or billionaire business people or

[<a id="01-04-51">01:04:51</a>]  ordinary people because they're unhappy so they have to manufacture fantasy you know recognized

[<a id="01-05-00">01:05:00</a>]  recognized you have a fantasy recognize why you have a fantasy they want you you know why you

[<a id="01-05-05">01:05:05</a>]  have it then you could figure out what you probably have to do to give yourself more meaningful and

[<a id="01-05-11">01:05:11</a>]  happy life yeah but that's the difficult part because i live in la it's a fantasy land it's not

[<a id="01-05-17">01:05:17</a>]  just pornography and hollywood acting the people in the music business in sports you know because

[<a id="01-05-23">01:05:23</a>]  when i was hanging out at tonight's show when i deliver porn that that hallway was such an

[<a id="01-05-27">01:05:27</a>]  interesting place guys jesus christ you have multi-platinum winning rapper and you reach

[<a id="01-05-34">01:05:34</a>]  the highest level so that's not fantasy anymore you're jealous of actors and then the actors will

[<a id="01-05-39">01:05:39</a>]  be jealous of athlete visiting tonight show and after be jealous of you know what i'm saying like

[<a id="01-05-44">01:05:44</a>]  it doesn't even if you reach the highest it's never enough and i'm just saying you could be

[<a id="01-05-49">01:05:49</a>]  happy if you want to that's the thing yeah most people don't want to especially if you're super

[<a id="01-05-54">01:05:54</a>]  competitive in nature um we're gonna we're gonna wrap it up here and we're gonna that was a fun

[<a id="01-05-59">01:05:59</a>]  episode kind of that was fun that was kind of um uh thanks how long do you think should we leave

[<a id="01-06-12">01:06:12</a>]  no no no you don't have to leave i mean we could go get some get takeaway or something
