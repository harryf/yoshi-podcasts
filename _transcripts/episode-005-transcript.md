[<a id="00-00-21">00:00:21</a>]  May you make people go why would you do that Yoshi? Oh

[<a id="00-00-28">00:00:28</a>]  and

[<a id="00-00-30">00:00:30</a>]  That makes sense and then well

[<a id="00-00-32">00:00:32</a>]  I wonder about that myself sometimes and the way of your name and then instead of our rated it's why you're a kid

[<a id="00-00-38">00:00:38</a>]  I mean whatever you wanted

[<a id="00-00-40">00:00:40</a>]  fine with me

[<a id="00-00-43">00:00:43</a>]  Hey, is it catching that's why rated why why rated?

[<a id="00-00-48">00:00:48</a>]  Welcome to why rated?

[<a id="00-00-51">00:00:51</a>]  conversation with Yoshi Oh my gosh, she

[<a id="00-00-53">00:00:53</a>]  That working for you I

[<a id="00-00-58">00:00:58</a>]  If that's that's fine with me, but maybe

[<a id="00-01-01">00:01:01</a>]  Want to take that microphone?

[<a id="00-01-04">00:01:04</a>]  The microphone that you have in front of you now

[<a id="00-01-06">00:01:06</a>]  Can you sit the way that you will be sitting when you're talking? I'm sure

[<a id="00-01-29">00:01:29</a>]  I

[<a id="00-01-31">00:01:31</a>]  Wear the headphones for sure. I think probably something like that

[<a id="00-01-37">00:01:37</a>]  I have 10 to 9 is

[<a id="00-01-47">00:01:47</a>]  Tendonite tinnitus

[<a id="00-01-52">00:01:52</a>]  Tinnitus I have that this coming permanent ringing in my ear tinnitus

[<a id="00-01-58">00:01:58</a>]  No, just just I just started having the problem

[<a id="00-02-01">00:02:01</a>]  Six seven years ago. So my hearing is a little weird. So it probably helps me a lot

[<a id="00-02-06">00:02:06</a>]  And I think it's good

[<a id="00-02-27">00:02:27</a>]  Because yesterday when we do it it was a good conversation

[<a id="00-02-30">00:02:30</a>]  But I don't know if it's a good thing for the listeners because we were meandering all over the place

[<a id="00-02-34">00:02:34</a>]  Used to use to like two people with dementia trying to go place and I go

[<a id="00-02-42">00:02:42</a>]  To me it made sense I felt like yeah, whatever

[<a id="00-02-48">00:02:48</a>]  Okay, welcome to Oh

[<a id="00-02-55">00:02:55</a>]  Welcome

[<a id="00-02-57">00:02:57</a>]  Welcome to why write a conversation with Yoshi or be actually we may just change your name or maybe not have a name at all

[<a id="00-03-05">00:03:05</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-03-06">00:03:06</a>]  We'll see

[<a id="00-03-08">00:03:08</a>]  Alright, it's interesting when I was doing this with you guys you guys are like two cops, you know, it's different way of like

[<a id="00-03-15">00:03:15</a>]  interrogating someone

[<a id="00-03-17">00:03:17</a>]  Why are the lights a bit too intense or what are you talking? No, no, it's a good cop bad cop

[<a id="00-03-24">00:03:24</a>]  So it was weird because when Christian did it today I

[<a id="00-03-27">00:03:27</a>]  Meant to like interviewing him, but I don't know why it

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  Turned out to be a pretty good conversation, but he basically ended up

[<a id="00-03-36">00:03:36</a>]  We ended up talking more about like

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  Beginning of the comedy stuff, but also

[<a id="00-03-44">00:03:44</a>]  It was a funny conversation

[<a id="00-03-47">00:03:47</a>]  About when I got into the adult business, you know in Seattle and things like that. Yeah, so

[<a id="00-03-53">00:03:53</a>]  He's he's very good at avoiding revealing things about himself

[<a id="00-03-57">00:03:57</a>]  I'm just

[<a id="00-04-00">00:04:00</a>]  What are you saying? You see because he secretly got a dark past and nobody really knows about

[<a id="00-04-06">00:04:06</a>]  Yeah, I think it goes you're saying Christian camps that you're saying this time and time again. It's a I

[<a id="00-04-13">00:04:13</a>]  Wonder what your fantasy is what my past is. I don't I don't have a fancy

[<a id="00-04-19">00:04:19</a>]  From doing podcast. Yeah in the past is the what I call the beast of breaker because he's a very nice guy and

[<a id="00-04-26">00:04:26</a>]  Everyone is like Christian. He's the sweetest guy or whatever

[<a id="00-04-29">00:04:29</a>]  Yeah, this this you get into a certain point and then the beast of breaker comes out the under you know

[<a id="00-04-36">00:04:36</a>]  when you get your eye exam and the doctor goes

[<a id="00-04-39">00:04:39</a>]  Is it better with this lens or this lens? Right? Yeah, and I got a feeling that

[<a id="00-04-47">00:04:47</a>]  Have you both to be on the same time, you know, cuz

[<a id="00-04-50">00:04:50</a>]  if I'm not

[<a id="00-04-53">00:04:53</a>]  Doing good job going to the right direction. One of you just remind me, you know, I'm most likely me so

[<a id="00-04-59">00:04:59</a>]  Or just talk over each other. Yeah, we can bring us how he has old man syndrome that he's just walking down

[<a id="00-05-06">00:05:06</a>]  Well, we're both we're in the same boat with that one. Well, that is actually true. You're both super old

[<a id="00-05-12">00:05:12</a>]  Hey, it's just around the corner for you, man

[<a id="00-05-17">00:05:17</a>]  It's just looming so okay. So yeah today. I'm curious about about

[<a id="00-05-23">00:05:23</a>]  the origin story, so

[<a id="00-05-26">00:05:26</a>]  You're originally from Korea we're like, you know, I was born in Japan you're born in Japan

[<a id="00-05-32">00:05:32</a>]  Yes, but so so you so your parents conceived you in Japan. You never spent time in Korea

[<a id="00-05-39">00:05:39</a>]  I think some of the confusing when I didn't know what to do because

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  When you're living in Japan, you don't you don't really think like Americans like I'm Korean or Chinese

[<a id="00-05-52">00:05:52</a>]  I just think I didn't I didn't even understand when I was a kid like

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  Japanese Korean like because they all look same to me. I mean if you guys think they all look same

[<a id="00-05-59">00:05:59</a>]  They really look same to me too

[<a id="00-06-02">00:06:02</a>]  And I didn't understand

[<a id="00-06-06">00:06:06</a>]  some of that painful

[<a id="00-06-09">00:06:09</a>]  history behind you know, like when I was

[<a id="00-06-11">00:06:11</a>]  Like for example, I didn't even know I was a Korean citizen until I was 17 years old

[<a id="00-06-16">00:06:16</a>]  My when I was going back to school a couple days before I went back to school

[<a id="00-06-20">00:06:20</a>]  over the summer

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  for some reason my mother and my family decided to

[<a id="00-06-26">00:06:26</a>]  Make me use my Korean name, which I didn't even know I had a Korean name. What is your Korean name?

[<a id="00-06-32">00:06:32</a>]  so it's it's we le maybe I'm not even saying it right, but it's

[<a id="00-06-37">00:06:37</a>]  Just imagine like couple days before you go your junior high school your parents there you actually you have this

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  Secondary name all this time. We didn't tell you now you got to use it

[<a id="00-06-47">00:06:47</a>]  so, can you imagine I just I just I just moved to

[<a id="00-06-51">00:06:51</a>]  California when I was

[<a id="00-06-55">00:06:55</a>]  sophomore

[<a id="00-06-56">00:06:56</a>]  What what is that for European sophomore? So far is like that's like post high school

[<a id="00-07-02">00:07:02</a>]  Well, it's it's so high school is four years, right? Right. So first year is freshman

[<a id="00-07-06">00:07:06</a>]  sophomore junior

[<a id="00-07-09">00:07:09</a>]  Senior then you graduate sophomore means exactly like a young idiot

[<a id="00-07-14">00:07:14</a>]  Like that's what it means like your freshman young idiot junior and senior and soft moron

[<a id="00-07-22">00:07:22</a>]  yeah, well, that's what it means, so I

[<a id="00-07-25">00:07:25</a>]  don't know why they did it but I

[<a id="00-07-28">00:07:28</a>]  got kicked out of Washington State I moved to Long Beach, California in the mid 80s and

[<a id="00-07-33">00:07:33</a>]  was particularly

[<a id="00-07-37">00:07:37</a>]  scary time in

[<a id="00-07-39">00:07:39</a>]  Southern California, you know, but you could just fear the racial tension

[<a id="00-07-42">00:07:42</a>]  You're probably four or five years away from LA riots

[<a id="00-07-46">00:07:46</a>]  LAPD were going crazy Long Beach, you know, like dr. Drake and Snoop talk about Long Beach rough and

[<a id="00-07-53">00:07:53</a>]  I

[<a id="00-07-55">00:07:55</a>]  Landed on the day. I think Richard Ramirez killed a second Asian person

[<a id="00-07-59">00:07:59</a>]  So that summer of 86 was crazy

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  85 but let's go back one step there because you

[<a id="00-08-09">00:08:09</a>]  Just jumped a bunch of bunch of years. Oh, yeah. So so I was born in Japan

[<a id="00-08-14">00:08:14</a>]  You were born in Japan. My mother was born in Korea, but she immigrated to Japan married my dad

[<a id="00-08-19">00:08:19</a>]  My dad was born in Japan, but he's ethically Korean

[<a id="00-08-21">00:08:21</a>]  He's ethnically Korean because my grandfather was forced to go to Japan because I Japan occupying

[<a id="00-08-27">00:08:27</a>]  Korean Peninsula, yes

[<a id="00-08-30">00:08:30</a>]  So that's Second World War

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  Prior to Second World War most World War two and second before that. So there was a conflict between

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  Japan Japan and Russians fighting over Korean Peninsula, right? So Russell Japanese were 1905. Yeah, and

[<a id="00-08-48">00:08:48</a>]  And after Japan won they occupied Korean Peninsula and some people from Korea were forced to go to Japan

[<a id="00-08-56">00:08:56</a>]  Some people in Korea decided to go to Japan for looking for opportunities, you know, right?

[<a id="00-09-00">00:09:00</a>]  I think the European equivalent is Japanese are English and Koreans and Irish

[<a id="00-09-06">00:09:06</a>]  okay, and

[<a id="00-09-08">00:09:08</a>]  That's why you have a K drama. So pretty good. You know, they're always putting metal dramatic, you know

[<a id="00-09-14">00:09:14</a>]  They're so good at it. So and for your your parents was it like an arranged marriage or I don't know that all the detail

[<a id="00-09-22">00:09:22</a>]  but I just know that

[<a id="00-09-24">00:09:24</a>]  I'm I'm pretty fucking sure my mom wasn't king on that idea and

[<a id="00-09-29">00:09:29</a>]  And it just didn't work out. So I think I think from that I think I will always had this attitude

[<a id="00-09-36">00:09:36</a>]  I hate to force people to do things. They don't want to do

[<a id="00-09-39">00:09:39</a>]  You know what I mean? And if somebody doesn't want to be with you

[<a id="00-09-42">00:09:42</a>]  You can't force them to stay with you, you know, yeah, so I'm pretty

[<a id="00-09-47">00:09:47</a>]  Big on that, you know, if somebody doesn't want to be a friend

[<a id="00-09-50">00:09:50</a>]  You know like during COVID because some of the position I take a lot of people stop talking to me

[<a id="00-09-56">00:09:56</a>]  And I'm it doesn't make me happy but to me friendships are like

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  TV shows

[<a id="00-10-03">00:10:03</a>]  You know, you didn't get your TV renewal for the seventh season, you know

[<a id="00-10-07">00:10:07</a>]  Thanks for at least the first six seasons, right our our friendship wasn't renewed for the seventh season, you know

[<a id="00-10-13">00:10:13</a>]  but people come and go we come to the world by them ourselves and

[<a id="00-10-18">00:10:18</a>]  We're gonna die and leave on our ourselves to you

[<a id="00-10-21">00:10:21</a>]  So that's something that you just have to get used to it. But yeah, I was born Japan. Whereabouts whereabouts Osaka Japan where

[<a id="00-10-28">00:10:28</a>]  There's a lot of Koreans live in that part, right? Like that show pachinko. I don't know if you heard this

[<a id="00-10-35">00:10:35</a>]  It was really weird last year

[<a id="00-10-40">00:10:40</a>]  Whenever the pachinko premiere same time with Tokyo vise on HBO Jake out of sting about

[<a id="00-10-47">00:10:47</a>]  both of those shows had

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  My people which is zainichi Koreans

[<a id="00-10-54">00:10:54</a>]  They're specific kind of Koreans. They are

[<a id="00-10-58">00:10:58</a>]  Koreans who were living in Japan

[<a id="00-11-01">00:11:01</a>]  prior to 1945 before end of the World War two and

[<a id="00-11-04">00:11:04</a>]  Their descendants are saying each Korean. So for example, if the Koreans moved to Japan now, they're just Koreans. They're not zainichi Koreans

[<a id="00-11-12">00:11:12</a>]  They're very specific kind of Koreans

[<a id="00-11-14">00:11:14</a>]  so that's that's who I am and

[<a id="00-11-18">00:11:18</a>]  Mostly that doing at this time like he's well, he was born in 1940 and

[<a id="00-11-22">00:11:22</a>]  My grandfather's most likely forced to go to Japan and is there like a family business they're doing or something. I

[<a id="00-11-32">00:11:32</a>]  I'm sure my grandfather had a pretty difficult job. I just remember him

[<a id="00-11-39">00:11:39</a>]  missing finger or two

[<a id="00-11-42">00:11:42</a>]  And I used to behind his back mock him because it was missing fingers and I I thought maybe he was like Yakuza

[<a id="00-11-49">00:11:49</a>]  But it was like working at some terrible labor like mining or manufacturing. He lost a finger or two, you know

[<a id="00-11-55">00:11:55</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-11-56">00:11:56</a>]  So because you have to do those the Korean people are forced to do that

[<a id="00-11-59">00:11:59</a>]  So if you watch those both of those shows they premiere same year. I'm just amazed

[<a id="00-12-04">00:12:04</a>]  Within last year and a half

[<a id="00-12-06">00:12:06</a>]  None Asian person will ask me. Are you zainichi it's because of those two fucking shows these shows

[<a id="00-12-12">00:12:12</a>]  That comes into the zeitgeist and people know what what that is. Yeah, and I think

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  part of the reason why

[<a id="00-12-20">00:12:20</a>]  I'm still from with Russell Peters and got along Russell is also a little bit different. It's Anglo Indian. He's not

[<a id="00-12-25">00:12:25</a>]  Regular Indian - you know, he grew up in Canada Canada, but I think because we're a little different. We appreciate each other's

[<a id="00-12-34">00:12:34</a>]  really weird position in our community, I guess and

[<a id="00-12-40">00:12:40</a>]  Of course in comedy too so that it is something it is something fascinating like you're growing up

[<a id="00-12-46">00:12:46</a>]  In a culture, that's very different to your own culture

[<a id="00-12-51">00:12:51</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-12-53">00:12:53</a>]  But when I explained to white person in America, it's really you guys all look same

[<a id="00-12-57">00:12:57</a>]  How could it be a minority but it's but it's it's tricky, right?

[<a id="00-13-01">00:13:01</a>]  So you have as a child you have an experience of a certain culture at home and you have an experience of a culture on the

[<a id="00-13-08">00:13:08</a>]  Street, yeah, so your cultural shift is daily and multiple times a day sometimes. Yeah

[<a id="00-13-14">00:13:14</a>]  so

[<a id="00-13-16">00:13:16</a>]  you

[<a id="00-13-17">00:13:17</a>]  Speak Korean at home. No, well, my mom did my dad and he didn't speak it very well

[<a id="00-13-23">00:13:23</a>]  He was born in Japan, you know, so he spoke mostly Japanese with you. Yes

[<a id="00-13-27">00:13:27</a>]  And well, whenever my mother was angry, she started speaking Korean start hitting us

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  Okay. Yeah, that's when you she's so angry when she starts speaking Korean who's who's us so you as you I have a younger brother

[<a id="00-13-40">00:13:40</a>]  young brother to it. Yeah to you and

[<a id="00-13-42">00:13:42</a>]  Okay, and so what were you like? What was little Yoshi you would you I remember you hearing you say you you grew up in

[<a id="00-13-51">00:13:51</a>]  A kind of a red-light district or something and jump in Osaka

[<a id="00-13-54">00:13:54</a>]  well

[<a id="00-13-56">00:13:56</a>]  So where I live

[<a id="00-13-58">00:13:58</a>]  there's a place called Taishoku, which is when in Osaka and

[<a id="00-14-03">00:14:03</a>]  it

[<a id="00-14-05">00:14:05</a>]  Within last 18 20 months. I've been there multiple times, you know

[<a id="00-14-10">00:14:10</a>]  And I can't believe how small it is like when I was a kid

[<a id="00-14-13">00:14:13</a>]  It looked like a such a massive place right but Osaka in particular the place I grew up

[<a id="00-14-18">00:14:18</a>]  they call it Manchester of Japan because there's a lot of manufacturing for people and

[<a id="00-14-23">00:14:23</a>]  Do you have also have the same misery like it's mostly gray and red brick stone. Yes, okay

[<a id="00-14-30">00:14:30</a>]  No, it's really great a lot of factory. And when I was a kid, the water was so dirty and polluted

[<a id="00-14-36">00:14:36</a>]  It seemed cleaner now

[<a id="00-14-38">00:14:38</a>]  but

[<a id="00-14-40">00:14:40</a>]  Where I live, there is a lot of see I didn't I didn't I didn't know the new ones different because I was too stupid

[<a id="00-14-46">00:14:46</a>]  Kid, but there's a lot of Okinawans living there. That's like equivalent of Japanese Puerto Ricans and you have a lot of

[<a id="00-14-53">00:14:53</a>]  crew Korean people there you also have a lot of

[<a id="00-14-58">00:14:58</a>]  Some Taiwanese and Chinese type of people church here. Yeah, but when you can you look you look they all look same like I really

[<a id="00-15-05">00:15:05</a>]  There's a really that big of a difference and I didn't understand the difference, you know

[<a id="00-15-09">00:15:09</a>]  No one's there because what makes them different from let's say somebody from Hokkaido. They're they they are way

[<a id="00-15-14">00:15:14</a>]  They're even more weird to me compared to

[<a id="00-15-17">00:15:17</a>]  People that I grew up, you know

[<a id="00-15-20">00:15:20</a>]  but because it was poor and because it was ethnic and

[<a id="00-15-25">00:15:25</a>]  Of course Osaka have a lot of mob types of people I grow at them

[<a id="00-15-29">00:15:29</a>]  So I just thought what they did was normal. And of course, it's not normal

[<a id="00-15-33">00:15:33</a>]  I do my grandfather or my uncle somebody else. I can't remember who did it, but I remember as a kid. There's three guys

[<a id="00-15-39">00:15:39</a>]  beating this guy up and I know my grandfather or some my

[<a id="00-15-44">00:15:44</a>]  Uncle somebody went out and I thought for a second he's gonna go stop the fight

[<a id="00-15-49">00:15:49</a>]  He went over there, you know those beer carton you kind of flip up

[<a id="00-15-53">00:15:53</a>]  You could set on that he said on that start smoking cigarette and beer and watch these three guys beat this guy up

[<a id="00-15-58">00:15:58</a>]  Hell yeah, and he was laughing about it. So he told me to come and watch this guy beat up

[<a id="00-16-02">00:16:02</a>]  So they're just three entertainment, yeah

[<a id="00-16-07">00:16:07</a>]  but my whoever I

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  Because recently I did the math

[<a id="00-16-12">00:16:12</a>]  I don't know if it's my grandfather because I think he might have been dead

[<a id="00-16-15">00:16:15</a>]  But if it was basically then what I learned was like, you know

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  This is what you gave you if you borrow money, you don't pay people back

[<a id="00-16-21">00:16:21</a>]  Okay, that's what it was that became very clear write them in there or is this something I do later?

[<a id="00-16-27">00:16:27</a>]  He just told me yeah, he didn't pay he didn't pay. Yeah, but it's also fun to watch people get beat up

[<a id="00-16-33">00:16:33</a>]  But it's it's a moral like he's teaching you morals. He wasn't teaching me

[<a id="00-16-38">00:16:38</a>]  He just told me why they're beating up. It's fun to get watch people get beat up. That was he was saying, okay

[<a id="00-16-43">00:16:43</a>]  Well, at least it was it was an older person that gave you context. So yeah, but but because it's a rough

[<a id="00-16-50">00:16:50</a>]  It's a rough neighborhood. It's relatively rough

[<a id="00-16-53">00:16:53</a>]  For Japan, I guess. Okay

[<a id="00-16-56">00:16:56</a>]  But you know when I was living when I got fired in 2012, I was living in Stockholm with my friend a deal

[<a id="00-17-03">00:17:03</a>]  he's a comic Pakistani Swiss Swedish comedian and

[<a id="00-17-07">00:17:07</a>]  When I was living there for time they would tell me these are the most dangerous place

[<a id="00-17-12">00:17:12</a>]  Like I went every time they tell me not to go I go

[<a id="00-17-15">00:17:15</a>]  Every time I was forced to go to Catholic Church and the priest it don't watch this movie. Of course, I'm gonna watch that movie

[<a id="00-17-21">00:17:21</a>]  Right, so I went and I just don't take European people that seriously because that these so-called rough places. I

[<a id="00-17-27">00:17:27</a>]  Was the black guy, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-17-30">00:17:30</a>]  Because all the blacks living in Stockholm, they're they speak four or five languages

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  They got a job. They go to school. They have health care

[<a id="00-17-39">00:17:39</a>]  They don't have guns and even if they did they don't know how to hold it like they're trying to be like American blacks

[<a id="00-17-45">00:17:45</a>]  Which is it but it's a so yeah, but there's something a little bit off like you don't even yeah

[<a id="00-17-51">00:17:51</a>]  I mean your skin tone is black, but that's about it

[<a id="00-17-54">00:17:54</a>]  You know, it's so I do appreciate wine, but but there's those violent places like they were just that's how

[<a id="00-17-59">00:17:59</a>]  Normal until when I got older I met these really fancy decent people with success and money in class

[<a id="00-18-08">00:18:08</a>]  Then that's when I realized oh my god, that's not how you supposed to behave like that

[<a id="00-18-12">00:18:12</a>]  Yeah, so were you a were you a tough kid or were you I'm not a tough kid

[<a id="00-18-16">00:18:16</a>]  You never was so how have I hit people? Yes. Have I been hidden? Yes

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  I've been hit too. And so how would you do it?

[<a id="00-18-23">00:18:23</a>]  Were you a the funny kid who took your way out with making people laugh?

[<a id="00-18-27">00:18:27</a>]  Well, how did you how did you if I mean if this?

[<a id="00-18-29">00:18:29</a>]  If your potential threat at any time kind of thing how there's a in Japan. There's a thing called Ijime

[<a id="00-18-38">00:18:38</a>]  Ijime Ijime

[<a id="00-18-42">00:18:42</a>]  It's like bullying picking on kids, but they take it to another level in Japan

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  So I think it's still true

[<a id="00-18-49">00:18:49</a>]  I think first week or two is it's probably one of the more dangerous time for young kids in Japan because they go back to school

[<a id="00-18-56">00:18:56</a>]  And the kids that doesn't fit in they suffer the consequence, you know

[<a id="00-19-00">00:19:00</a>]  So there was a period where I was getting beat up almost every day and there's always like three or four kids

[<a id="00-19-05">00:19:05</a>]  Chasing after me because you stick out you don't fit in. I think the thing in Japan is like

[<a id="00-19-12">00:19:12</a>]  The nail to stick out must be hammered in so if you stick out the society have

[<a id="00-19-17">00:19:17</a>]  responsibility to hammer that person in

[<a id="00-19-20">00:19:20</a>]  but problem is if the nail is taken out a little too far you can't hammer that person ie me, so

[<a id="00-19-27">00:19:27</a>]  That happened so many times and there was no help so eventually I remember

[<a id="00-19-34">00:19:34</a>]  One of my neighbor he's clearly like a mob guy or one of the lower-end mob guy

[<a id="00-19-40">00:19:40</a>]  He got sick of seeing me crying every day

[<a id="00-19-42">00:19:42</a>]  If I see you cry home again, I'm gonna kill you. That's what he told me. He wasn't joking around

[<a id="00-19-48">00:19:48</a>]  I mean, he said I never heard a don't talk to somebody like that, you know

[<a id="00-19-53">00:19:53</a>]  So but he said like look

[<a id="00-19-56">00:19:56</a>]  This is what you need to do. So he helped me

[<a id="00-19-59">00:19:59</a>]  He he told me to bring them broa and then brought it and he put bunch of metal pieces inside

[<a id="00-20-07">00:20:07</a>]  Kind of made it really tight. So he was like a weapon. They look like I'm broa, right?

[<a id="00-20-11">00:20:11</a>]  He said next time they chase you

[<a id="00-20-14">00:20:14</a>]  Hit one of them with this but he told me specifically but don't hit everyone just hurt one really bad

[<a id="00-20-21">00:20:21</a>]  Then you're gonna the rest of them will think twice to doing that. So I think he was your shit. Mr

[<a id="00-20-28">00:20:28</a>]  Miyagi like just

[<a id="00-20-31">00:20:31</a>]  Defends his wife's he didn't care about me. I don't think necessarily just didn't they just think they want to hear that shit, you know, so

[<a id="00-20-38">00:20:38</a>]  And I think reminding him of being a kid himself he had to toughen up or something something

[<a id="00-20-46">00:20:46</a>]  But I remember finding one of the day when I was walking back. They tried to corner me

[<a id="00-20-50">00:20:50</a>]  So I ran out of the school there. They're chasing me at the same route and there was a one passage where it's kind of narrow

[<a id="00-20-57">00:20:57</a>]  I turned around hitting that one kid while I'm hitting the kid other kids are hitting me

[<a id="00-21-02">00:21:02</a>]  But I follow instruction. I think I hit that kid pretty hard and I think

[<a id="00-21-07">00:21:07</a>]  He had to go to I think he had to go see a doctor or something and then like within the two

[<a id="00-21-13">00:21:13</a>]  His mom showed up and the teacher they were talking to me, right and and this is a common theme

[<a id="00-21-18">00:21:18</a>]  That's not the first or the last time I did something like that, you know, so

[<a id="00-21-23">00:21:23</a>]  They chastised me and a couple days later my dad and my mom had to take a cake and a plancha

[<a id="00-21-28">00:21:28</a>]  It's today, but the whole time you're thinking like, okay, maybe I'm a jerk or whatever

[<a id="00-21-32">00:21:32</a>]  But I is it really fair to have three to five guys kids chasing me after school almost every day and doing that

[<a id="00-21-38">00:21:38</a>]  You know, whatever it is. I annoyed them. I wish I knew their remember their names

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  It would have been nice to meet them again after like 50 years

[<a id="00-21-47">00:21:47</a>]  Well first beat them up first then ask, you know

[<a id="00-21-50">00:21:50</a>]  but

[<a id="00-21-52">00:21:52</a>]  I'm sure it was annoying but growing up. My parents are fighting all the time every day

[<a id="00-21-57">00:21:57</a>]  It was not a good circumstance, you know, I think my brother was too young to remember but man just

[<a id="00-22-06">00:22:06</a>]  Just getting waking up middle of the night. They're screaming and

[<a id="00-22-11">00:22:11</a>]  Dishes broken my mom trying to use a knife and tried to stab my dad and you know

[<a id="00-22-17">00:22:17</a>]  So the conflict was like constant. Yeah, I mean in neighborhoods like that because I

[<a id="00-22-23">00:22:23</a>]  Think poor the neighborhood and there's a reason why they're poor

[<a id="00-22-27">00:22:27</a>]  but one of the reason is

[<a id="00-22-29">00:22:29</a>]  People like my parents people in that neighborhood never learned conflict resolution

[<a id="00-22-35">00:22:35</a>]  Because they get loud they get violent, but that's the sign of the poor people. You know, I think I think

[<a id="00-22-41">00:22:41</a>]  not knowing I

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  Mean

[<a id="00-22-47">00:22:47</a>]  We reduce tension things like that. I mean you have Geneva Convention here, right?

[<a id="00-22-51">00:22:51</a>]  we don't have things like that and in that neighborhood, you just saw a lot of violence, you know, and

[<a id="00-22-56">00:22:56</a>]  So you go to you go to school in that area?

[<a id="00-22-59">00:22:59</a>]  For how many years? I think I was in Japan until fourth grade, but run second grade

[<a id="00-23-07">00:23:07</a>]  My mom took me and my younger brother

[<a id="00-23-11">00:23:11</a>]  The first kidnapping so we we left around second when I was second grade. I think we moved another part of Osaka, Japan

[<a id="00-23-16">00:23:16</a>]  Wait, you said the first kidnapping. Well, I mean 1980 when when my parents got divorced

[<a id="00-23-22">00:23:22</a>]  She basically told my dad that we're moving different part of Osaka

[<a id="00-23-26">00:23:26</a>]  But she what she did was she moved myself and my younger brother to USA

[<a id="00-23-29">00:23:29</a>]  So there's a couple weeks. My dad was looking for us, but that's the second first time when I was second grade

[<a id="00-23-35">00:23:35</a>]  Just can you imagine you you my dad went to work one morning when he got back work?

[<a id="00-23-41">00:23:41</a>]  You're gone. All the furnitures are gone. We're gone. Oh

[<a id="00-23-44">00:23:44</a>]  It was one of those. Yeah, like empties the apartment

[<a id="00-23-48">00:23:48</a>]  Yeah, I didn't know what was going on, you know, and what were you told? What did your mom tell you?

[<a id="00-23-54">00:23:54</a>]  I don't know. I don't remember only thing. I remember that day we were

[<a id="00-23-59">00:23:59</a>]  we're in taxi and the guy was driving us and we're just figuring her out and then

[<a id="00-24-05">00:24:05</a>]  What he parked and my mom walked out and walk into this building wasn't she if it's the right apartment

[<a id="00-24-12">00:24:12</a>]  and a guy said and my brother was way too young something something something was it this and

[<a id="00-24-18">00:24:18</a>]  in Japan this means like

[<a id="00-24-21">00:24:21</a>]  Somebody's having an affair or there's like a second in person

[<a id="00-24-25">00:24:25</a>]  So he thought is your mom mad because your dad having an affair or something

[<a id="00-24-29">00:24:29</a>]  But this motherfuckers to talk into a second grade like, you know, yes, but this is the 70s

[<a id="00-24-34">00:24:34</a>]  remember like, you know back then my dad will drink bunch of beer while drinking and driving and

[<a id="00-24-40">00:24:40</a>]  You know, I mean they were doing all kinds of shit. It's not PC these days. Yeah. Yeah for sure

[<a id="00-24-45">00:24:45</a>]  So I'm back in before

[<a id="00-24-47">00:24:47</a>]  Like before the kidnapping. Yeah, what is I mean, I call it kidnapping, but I don't I don't know. I guess that's normal in Japan

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  I don't know

[<a id="00-24-56">00:24:56</a>]  Butters just fuck off, but I mean what was like so you're gonna school what what else are you like?

[<a id="00-25-01">00:25:01</a>]  How what's your daily life like you doing a paper round for you?

[<a id="00-25-05">00:25:05</a>]  Are you earning money somehow?

[<a id="00-25-08">00:25:08</a>]  Sports sports. Yeah

[<a id="00-25-10">00:25:10</a>]  Well when I was living with my dad, whatever it's just like a dumb kid wasn't really good in school. I had friends and

[<a id="00-25-18">00:25:18</a>]  Oh, you know one one thing was peculiar for sure is

[<a id="00-25-29">00:25:29</a>]  I'm always the kid who walk furthest distance away from home

[<a id="00-25-34">00:25:34</a>]  like I don't think most of these parents these days were allowed some kid just

[<a id="00-25-39">00:25:39</a>]  Walk away

[<a id="00-25-42">00:25:42</a>]  Long distance, you know

[<a id="00-25-45">00:25:45</a>]  Yeah, yeah, I think that's kind of gone now. Like I don't think that people walk to school anymore in Japan right now

[<a id="00-25-51">00:25:51</a>]  It's shocking to me because

[<a id="00-25-55">00:25:55</a>]  Reverse culture shock, right? Like I grew up in Japan. I've been away so long. So when I went back recently

[<a id="00-25-59">00:25:59</a>]  There's things that they do in Japan that is so weird or like I can't believe it

[<a id="00-26-04">00:26:04</a>]  Like five or six year old kids will get on bus and subway go someplace really far away by themselves

[<a id="00-26-10">00:26:10</a>]  You could never allow that and stay somebody's gonna catch them murder them, you know

[<a id="00-26-14">00:26:14</a>]  Well, there's something weird but that shit doesn't happen in Japan anymore. No, they still let them do that

[<a id="00-26-19">00:26:19</a>]  No, it's like but the murdering shit. Oh, yeah. Yeah

[<a id="00-26-23">00:26:23</a>]  We don't have that many Americans living in Japan

[<a id="00-26-26">00:26:26</a>]  So, but you

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  For a while what but both my parents both your parents. Yeah, what's that?

[<a id="00-26-34">00:26:34</a>]  What's the but but like like I was saying sometimes I randomly take a bus pay. I have enough one money for

[<a id="00-26-40">00:26:40</a>]  Bus one way. I don't even know where I'm going

[<a id="00-26-43">00:26:43</a>]  So you're just exploring then I go and then I tried to walk back like seven eight nine miles when I was a kid

[<a id="00-26-48">00:26:48</a>]  Hell yes. Yeah, so like I was doing weird shit like that. Yeah, I remember

[<a id="00-26-52">00:26:52</a>]  Hearing what she was saying you you you'd run you were doing like uber for prostitutes like uber eats or something

[<a id="00-26-59">00:26:59</a>]  I mean, I was helping some of my porn friend, but that's many years from that point, you know, okay

[<a id="00-27-05">00:27:05</a>]  I wasn't doing that when I was a kid. Oh

[<a id="00-27-07">00:27:07</a>]  I know what you're saying

[<a id="00-27-09">00:27:09</a>]  You gave me confused because you got uber things near no. No, there's there's people named my neighborhood

[<a id="00-27-15">00:27:15</a>]  They see this dumb kid, which I am and sometimes hey

[<a id="00-27-20">00:27:20</a>]  Can you do me something like they told me to go get go buy them something, right?

[<a id="00-27-25">00:27:25</a>]  So like you the kid the guy would give me money and say hey go give me beer back then and even you're under age

[<a id="00-27-30">00:27:30</a>]  You could go and then go to a store and buy beers. I'm getting it for my dad or my mom or whatever, right?

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  So yeah, that's what you have kids for right?

[<a id="00-27-37">00:27:37</a>]  It's gonna be some benefit yeah

[<a id="00-27-42">00:27:42</a>]  So so I have people like that in neighborhood like you didn't know what they did

[<a id="00-27-45">00:27:45</a>]  But they didn't didn't look regular job like mine. My dad actually worked for company, you know, like wear suit and shit like that

[<a id="00-27-51">00:27:51</a>]  What did he do work for insurance company?

[<a id="00-27-54">00:27:54</a>]  say or is it I don't know what I just remember he worked for insurance company and

[<a id="00-27-58">00:27:58</a>]  boring job and

[<a id="00-28-01">00:28:01</a>]  There's nothing dangerous about his life, you know, he was always very careful with everything

[<a id="00-28-06">00:28:06</a>]  He didn't like the way he grew up with his

[<a id="00-28-10">00:28:10</a>]  Dad being like a laborer or in a really bad neighborhood. So he wanted to climb the ladder socially somehow, I guess

[<a id="00-28-18">00:28:18</a>]  Did he was he one of those guys?

[<a id="00-28-21">00:28:21</a>]  That wouldn't come home at night after work because they were too shitfaced because they were drinking with the boss

[<a id="00-28-26">00:28:26</a>]  Did that already happen to it?

[<a id="00-28-29">00:28:29</a>]  I think that's like mandatory for a lot of people working for in Japanese were for companies kaisha

[<a id="00-28-34">00:28:34</a>]  So when you work for kaisha, that's kind of common thing

[<a id="00-28-37">00:28:37</a>]  Do you have to do and so that happened to him too despite being very especially back those days when the Japan was recovering economy

[<a id="00-28-44">00:28:44</a>]  was great, yeah, yeah, yeah, and

[<a id="00-28-46">00:28:46</a>]  But but then the money must have been flowing in in some sense like he had a decent job. I

[<a id="00-28-51">00:28:51</a>]  Never thought we were definitely not rich my mom's father was a very wealthy person

[<a id="00-28-59">00:28:59</a>]  But when my mother's father my grandfather passed away, he had a manufacturing company. They were rich. I think

[<a id="00-29-07">00:29:07</a>]  My dad my mother's father's siblings took over everything and and and my grand the grandmother ended up with nothing

[<a id="00-29-14">00:29:14</a>]  Oh

[<a id="00-29-15">00:29:15</a>]  Wow, and that's why I think the struggle kind of started from that point on and I think my mom was wasn't kind of forced

[<a id="00-29-22">00:29:22</a>]  To marry my dad, you know, yeah back then you have a too many

[<a id="00-29-25">00:29:25</a>]  I mean, I think my mom had like four or five sisters and one brother or something like that

[<a id="00-29-31">00:29:31</a>]  So they can they just have to get stuck getting rid of the kids, you know, I've been afford that

[<a id="00-29-36">00:29:36</a>]  but she

[<a id="00-29-38">00:29:38</a>]  She married the wrong guy, you know, it's just that he was nice guy, but just they were not compatible, you know

[<a id="00-29-43">00:29:43</a>]  So that's that's the thing like whenever I think

[<a id="00-29-47">00:29:47</a>]  My friends or me things doesn't work about the opposite sex like it's better that end and like not drag it, you know

[<a id="00-29-54">00:29:54</a>]  Oh my god. Yes

[<a id="00-29-56">00:29:56</a>]  It's not fun. It's no fun

[<a id="00-29-58">00:29:58</a>]  But but it's the other the other side is horrible like it was trying it out and then then we're should happen. So

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  But okay, let's go to the first kidnapping then

[<a id="00-30-07">00:30:07</a>]  so second grade

[<a id="00-30-10">00:30:10</a>]  She says to grab all your stuff we got a taxi we went to this apartment

[<a id="00-30-16">00:30:16</a>]  within a couple days

[<a id="00-30-19">00:30:19</a>]  I'm going to a different school. I have no idea where the fuck we are and

[<a id="00-30-23">00:30:23</a>]  So she could just do that. She could just put you in a different school

[<a id="00-30-27">00:30:27</a>]  Every year in Japan. I don't know. I forgot the word but it's something like vanishing

[<a id="00-30-33">00:30:33</a>]  There's people in Japan under pressure or during the really bad scrimmage signs or they owe money

[<a id="00-30-39">00:30:39</a>]  They literally disappear change their name reappear someplace else in Japan

[<a id="00-30-43">00:30:43</a>]  The guy who made the show Tokyo Vice he had a podcast go vanishing or something like that, right?

[<a id="00-30-50">00:30:50</a>]  I thought that and Japan is not a large country and it's amazing that you could do that

[<a id="00-30-55">00:30:55</a>]  But people do that all the time, you know, so for whatever reason they disappeared. That's crazy

[<a id="00-31-00">00:31:00</a>]  So it's kind of socially accepted kind of like I don't know if it's socially accepted but socially known to happen, you know, right?

[<a id="00-31-08">00:31:08</a>]  Yeah, so I

[<a id="00-31-12">00:31:12</a>]  She did she did that and eventually, you know with you and your brother. Yeah, and I think

[<a id="00-31-18">00:31:18</a>]  Within a month or two all of a sudden. Okay, you're gonna see your father

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  So we went multiple trains up here someplace else and I see dad, you know

[<a id="00-31-28">00:31:28</a>]  Like I didn't know what was going on. Like how come with that? We moved here. What happened to our dad?

[<a id="00-31-32">00:31:32</a>]  She she doesn't say, you know, Asian parents are all fucking liars. They never tell you what's going on, you know

[<a id="00-31-38">00:31:38</a>]  Yeah, what was a stupid movie everything everywhere all at once whatever. I hate that fucking movie because a

[<a id="00-31-46">00:31:46</a>]  couple things

[<a id="00-31-49">00:31:49</a>]  Chinese grandparents are okay with your grandkids being homosexual. What part of planet do you live in? That's like

[<a id="00-31-59">00:31:59</a>]  Homosexual Jews in Hollywood think that's normal

[<a id="00-32-01">00:32:01</a>]  You honestly that's gonna be okay

[<a id="00-32-05">00:32:05</a>]  I'll tell you what most likely it's gonna happen the gay grandson daughter sleeping and middle of the night

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  Some people walk in the work room with a fucking big wooden mallet beating the shit out of that person or do something

[<a id="00-32-19">00:32:19</a>]  Horrendous and at the end of the movie Asian parents apologize in their Asian kids

[<a id="00-32-25">00:32:25</a>]  Yeah, there's a limit for fantasy and science fiction. There's a limit to that and that's never going to happen

[<a id="00-32-31">00:32:31</a>]  But I was that there is the most stupidest movie ever

[<a id="00-32-34">00:32:34</a>]  You know, it's only

[<a id="00-32-36">00:32:36</a>]  Jews and these homosexual make this fantasy that Asian parents apologize to their kids

[<a id="00-32-42">00:32:42</a>]  This never happened, but there's something about I wish that movie in a cinema and there was this it's a great acted

[<a id="00-32-48">00:32:48</a>]  Whatever I understand non-asian people lucky about I was watching like that. So this is a fantasy

[<a id="00-32-53">00:32:53</a>]  They're not gonna punish their kids. So I was sound next to this this girl. She's like, I don't know 23

[<a id="00-32-59">00:32:59</a>]  I didn't know she just happens to in the scene and and near the end where there's like whatever that doughnut thing. Yeah

[<a id="00-33-05">00:33:05</a>]  Balling her eyes out. Yeah, like this speaks to something on a mother-daughter

[<a id="00-33-11">00:33:11</a>]  Relationship. I was like, alright, it's just like it's an overload of visuals and sound right now

[<a id="00-33-19">00:33:19</a>]  I love the fact that you're say you're boiling down that movie to Asian parents never apologize to their kids

[<a id="00-33-26">00:33:26</a>]  I mean, okay, maybe I'm every

[<a id="00-33-28">00:33:28</a>]  They had a woman in there with sausage fingers. Yeah now it clearly was a fantasy like, you know, yeah

[<a id="00-33-37">00:33:37</a>]  But this is by the way, this is another but you also forget I've been to places like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

[<a id="00-33-43">00:33:43</a>]  I've seen people with sausage fingers. Oh fuck. So that wasn't really that unusual to me

[<a id="00-33-49">00:33:49</a>]  In fact, yeah, I saw people from surviving that I'm older than I remember. I

[<a id="00-33-54">00:33:54</a>]  Call them bacon face. I call them okonomiyaki face like a Japanese pizza face because

[<a id="00-34-00">00:34:00</a>]  The residue of the burn. I remember seeing their faces and of course, I mean since I'm a kid

[<a id="00-34-06">00:34:06</a>]  I just started laughing at their faces. Holy fuck

[<a id="00-34-09">00:34:09</a>]  But I didn't understand the world war two and I didn't I thought I thought they looked like that because they did something bad

[<a id="00-34-16">00:34:16</a>]  Which clearly they did because they bombed Pearl Harbor

[<a id="00-34-19">00:34:19</a>]  Did you would you would you see a lot around like was this like a common thing?

[<a id="00-34-25">00:34:25</a>]  Because I mean anything we had this thing with the fluid yeah kids with the short arms

[<a id="00-34-30">00:34:30</a>]  yeah, because there was this drug that they were giving pregnant women and then they would and and there was a there was an

[<a id="00-34-36">00:34:36</a>]  Error where you would just quite common to see these

[<a id="00-34-39">00:34:39</a>]  Yeah, were you seeing like was it was it common to see someone who survived?

[<a id="00-34-43">00:34:43</a>]  It's not common because Asian people think to hide that stuff

[<a id="00-34-47">00:34:47</a>]  Okay, and how far is Osaka from?

[<a id="00-34-50">00:34:50</a>]  Hiroshima

[<a id="00-34-53">00:34:53</a>]  What the bullet train like two three hours, maybe okay. It's still the most southern tip, you know, yeah Nagasaki, Hiroshima, but

[<a id="00-35-00">00:35:00</a>]  Yeah, so I think

[<a id="00-35-04">00:35:04</a>]  It's a classic stand-up comedy 101 I think because they were fighting all the time

[<a id="00-35-11">00:35:11</a>]  I'm trying to make them laugh sometime at work. So I was saying something ridiculous or it's a misdirection

[<a id="00-35-16">00:35:16</a>]  I was causing all kinds of problem in school. So I thought I mean

[<a id="00-35-22">00:35:22</a>]  That's how I'm justified now as a old man, but I think that's what I was trying to do

[<a id="00-35-28">00:35:28</a>]  You were a shit kid basically

[<a id="00-35-30">00:35:30</a>]  Maybe if I would cause enough problem that they were focused instead of finding each other to trying to help me with it

[<a id="00-35-35">00:35:35</a>]  That's I think that's what I was thinking, but I don't know, you know, it's it's

[<a id="00-35-40">00:35:40</a>]  it's

[<a id="00-35-41">00:35:41</a>]  It's been 50 years since I start causing problems right when I was five or something like that

[<a id="00-35-45">00:35:45</a>]  Was there was there a plan for you? Like you were causing issues?

[<a id="00-35-49">00:35:49</a>]  Staring the pot and all that sort of stuff. But was there a plan in your head where it's like

[<a id="00-35-55">00:35:55</a>]  This is what I want to become

[<a id="00-35-57">00:35:57</a>]  Did you know I'm a retarded you understand like I was a dumb kid. I didn't think in those terms at all

[<a id="00-36-04">00:36:04</a>]  All right. So for you, it was the hustle

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  I mean you could ask him I know you should you know what you want to become if you don't want it

[<a id="00-36-11">00:36:11</a>]  What do you want to be when you're growing up? I'm still trying to figure that out right now. I

[<a id="00-36-15">00:36:15</a>]  don't know if I you know, because I think

[<a id="00-36-19">00:36:19</a>]  You know that French writer

[<a id="00-36-23">00:36:23</a>]  Marcel Proust my name

[<a id="00-36-26">00:36:26</a>]  Remembers the things past of course. I didn't read it because it's such a massive volumes of books

[<a id="00-36-32">00:36:32</a>]  But there was a couple passages where it's interesting. It's huge books, right? Like so, but I remember

[<a id="00-36-39">00:36:39</a>]  Something that we had to read in class where there's something

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  Either it was like a flower or cooking or something

[<a id="00-36-49">00:36:49</a>]  Anyway, that the main protagonist smell something and that triggers her memories

[<a id="00-36-54">00:36:54</a>]  That is very true when I went back to that neighborhood grandma certain food

[<a id="00-36-59">00:36:59</a>]  Certain smell certain buildings. It did bring a lot of stuff back, you know, right? So but did you remember?

[<a id="00-37-07">00:37:07</a>]  Being there when you of course you you remember being there does some of the ladies I knew the neighborhood was clearly hookers

[<a id="00-37-15">00:37:15</a>]  Looking back, right, but I know that at the time

[<a id="00-37-19">00:37:19</a>]  I'm new I remember like one of the ladies that could you go me something I did and when I come back she showed me

[<a id="00-37-24">00:37:24</a>]  Her tits so that our payments. Yeah

[<a id="00-37-27">00:37:27</a>]  but see

[<a id="00-37-29">00:37:29</a>]  Good it was really weird when she did that because if you're young enough you go to public bath and

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  So if you went with your dad as a kid

[<a id="00-37-40">00:37:40</a>]  like we have a bath at home, but I think we were having some kind of

[<a id="00-37-45">00:37:45</a>]  Problem they're fixing the bathroom something. So they did take me to public bath. I remember going with my dad

[<a id="00-37-52">00:37:52</a>]  So if you're young enough, you you go because I'm a boys like you go with that and because I'm short

[<a id="00-37-58">00:37:58</a>]  So that's why I can I'm at the dick level. So all this men stick, you know, I'm walking in

[<a id="00-38-03">00:38:03</a>]  Dicks are coming at you like remember in Star Wars when the Millennium Falcon

[<a id="00-38-08">00:38:08</a>]  Pops are coming at me, right?

[<a id="00-38-11">00:38:11</a>]  But if you're young enough, you could go with your mom and I've seen naked people

[<a id="00-38-15">00:38:15</a>]  ladies, right so I've seen naked and and because I didn't grow up in the West there was never like

[<a id="00-38-22">00:38:22</a>]  Shame about bodies and stuff. Okay, I'm gonna do this where they all pixeled the dicks. No, I just went really hard

[<a id="00-38-29">00:38:29</a>]  But so she's so this this woman shows you this is famous and you're just like whatever

[<a id="00-38-38">00:38:38</a>]  What well, or you know you anyway, it was a little different with that because you know, you know that joke

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  Yeah, it's not I don't know if it's joke, but David tell talk about this one time

[<a id="00-38-49">00:38:49</a>]  He was talking about how weird it is when you go New York City

[<a id="00-38-52">00:38:52</a>]  Like a lower Manhattan like a really nice so home places like that

[<a id="00-38-56">00:38:56</a>]  I don't remember the joke how he said it but he thought it was funny that

[<a id="00-38-59">00:38:59</a>]  You know, sometimes these rich people have a really pedigree dogs and they have a sweater on. Yeah, but they only have sweater up here

[<a id="00-39-07">00:39:07</a>]  Yeah

[<a id="00-39-08">00:39:08</a>]  Now it's weird because now all you see is dick sticking out of the dog

[<a id="00-39-11">00:39:11</a>]  Like you don't put a sweater on it looks normal. But soon as you put a sweater on it just look like

[<a id="00-39-18">00:39:18</a>]  It look like your grandfather walk around with your dick sticking out. Yeah, it looks weird sometime

[<a id="00-39-23">00:39:23</a>]  Less is better. It's like emphasized

[<a id="00-39-26">00:39:26</a>]  Depart. Yeah. Yeah. So when she showed me tits that that sent me like, oh instead of going public backs in everybody naked

[<a id="00-39-35">00:39:35</a>]  This made it more

[<a id="00-39-38">00:39:38</a>]  Special for some reason but I didn't I couldn't

[<a id="00-39-40">00:39:40</a>]  I couldn't process that idea at all, you know

[<a id="00-39-45">00:39:45</a>]  So what did you think when you saw the tits you were like, did he get horny?

[<a id="00-39-48">00:39:48</a>]  Mom, I was so young but like but I was trying to process like this gotta mean mean something

[<a id="00-39-54">00:39:54</a>]  What what does this mean?

[<a id="00-39-57">00:39:57</a>]  You know, it's gonna mean something. Yeah

[<a id="00-40-01">00:40:01</a>]  You're like what seven and you're like maybe even younger

[<a id="00-40-06">00:40:06</a>]  because okay, the thing that I'm gonna tell right now is one of the thing that kill I'm beginning the show that I did in

[<a id="00-40-13">00:40:13</a>]  Scotland and

[<a id="00-40-16">00:40:16</a>]  So it was one of the like a typical night. They're arguing

[<a id="00-40-19">00:40:19</a>]  I'm sleeping also wake up because they're screaming and my brother running tried to

[<a id="00-40-24">00:40:24</a>]  Stop my parents from fighting. Uh-huh, and I hate seeing that shit. I

[<a id="00-40-29">00:40:29</a>]  Usually put a blanket over my head just ignore it's not happening. But that particular day I got so sick of I went downstairs

[<a id="00-40-35">00:40:35</a>]  To that room like an office and

[<a id="00-40-42">00:40:42</a>]  My dad a bunch of books in there and these are like a really big books, you know

[<a id="00-40-46">00:40:46</a>]  And like I don't know why I did it but I usually pile all different books to pile them up trying to make like a castle

[<a id="00-40-52">00:40:52</a>]  So I could go in kind of hide so I piled up and they were just screaming arguing for so long

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  So I piled it up

[<a id="00-40-59">00:40:59</a>]  I need a couple more books to finish so I could be inside in clothes and hide and I ran out of books

[<a id="00-41-05">00:41:05</a>]  And I used all the books until I noticed on the top shelf. There's a couple books up there

[<a id="00-41-09">00:41:09</a>]  So I put a chair climb up got those books and I never noticed before that but but these are special books and and they're basically

[<a id="00-41-17">00:41:17</a>]  nude pictures and people are engaged in sex and

[<a id="00-41-21">00:41:21</a>]  And they're not Asian people. They're like Europeans. I think my dad. I don't know. It's one of those fancy artsy sex books, you know

[<a id="00-41-30">00:41:30</a>]  basically French

[<a id="00-41-32">00:41:32</a>]  Something French. Yeah. Yeah, so I was confused because I look at them a

[<a id="00-41-38">00:41:38</a>]  Couple things happen that was confusing to me one

[<a id="00-41-40">00:41:40</a>]  One of them was magazine and all rest of the books and one of the magazine, you know, how in this

[<a id="00-41-46">00:41:46</a>]  67 the 80s born they put stars in their genitalia. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I

[<a id="00-41-52">00:41:52</a>]  thought these white people had stars permanently I

[<a id="00-41-57">00:41:57</a>]  Thought they're aliens right because I never seen white

[<a id="00-42-05">00:42:05</a>]  So the young younger listeners it's it put a star because they're censoring that but I didn't I thought these

[<a id="00-42-11">00:42:11</a>]  Why I never slide people have stars as things. Yeah, so that they're alien because that's why they have stars whatever right, right

[<a id="00-42-18">00:42:18</a>]  But the most bizarre part the part that made me I think a year's looking back. This was the first thing

[<a id="00-42-25">00:42:25</a>]  Clearly put me in a path is

[<a id="00-42-30">00:42:30</a>]  That they were doing something that I've never seen before so they're saying of course they engage in sex, but I don't know what that was

[<a id="00-42-37">00:42:37</a>]  That that's not the part that interests me. There was a other parts where they're hugging and kissing each other

[<a id="00-42-43">00:42:43</a>]  It's something I never saw my parents do holy fuck. So I didn't know what this was

[<a id="00-42-50">00:42:50</a>]  So you saw a hug in a book the first time and well, I mean Asian people don't do that in generally speaking

[<a id="00-42-58">00:42:58</a>]  No, they don't actually they don't do that. So I didn't I didn't the new thing didn't bother me because I grew up public baths

[<a id="00-43-05">00:43:05</a>]  I've seen people naked so I don't have I didn't grow up like somebody telling me nudity is bad or

[<a id="00-43-09">00:43:09</a>]  Right and much less sex because I didn't even know what that was. But this is the first time I saw like

[<a id="00-43-14">00:43:14</a>]  I don't know what this is

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  But they seem to like each other. They seem to be very sweet

[<a id="00-43-20">00:43:20</a>]  Something that my parents don't do I don't know what this is

[<a id="00-43-24">00:43:24</a>]  But this seems like it's a wonderful thing and we could use more of this in the world

[<a id="00-43-28">00:43:28</a>]  And this is this this was my introduction to pornography

[<a id="00-43-31">00:43:31</a>]  Really? This is the first porn that you've ever seen. I mean, I think so that's bookshelf and

[<a id="00-43-37">00:43:37</a>]  Because then because they were fighting and I need a book to cover and huh?

[<a id="00-43-41">00:43:41</a>]  I and then I used those to kind of cover that I just hid there, you know, yeah

[<a id="00-43-45">00:43:45</a>]  so

[<a id="00-43-48">00:43:48</a>]  And of course when you get older

[<a id="00-43-52">00:43:52</a>]  Must miss that must be when I was like six or seven years old

[<a id="00-43-56">00:43:56</a>]  And that it was probably another three or four years before

[<a id="00-44-00">00:44:00</a>]  My mom kidnapped us for the second and the permanent time where we went to USA

[<a id="00-44-07">00:44:07</a>]  Right, but it's so after the first kidnapping. Yeah, you did go and see your dad

[<a id="00-44-12">00:44:12</a>]  We were allowed to see him maybe once a month or every other week or something, right?

[<a id="00-44-17">00:44:17</a>]  But you never moved back in together. Did you?

[<a id="00-44-20">00:44:20</a>]  Well funny you say that because I think

[<a id="00-44-22">00:44:22</a>]  Maybe a little over a year, maybe year and a half. There was a knock on the apartment door and

[<a id="00-44-29">00:44:29</a>]  There's my dad and his best friend and my mom was like fuck

[<a id="00-44-33">00:44:33</a>]  They found us. Yeah

[<a id="00-44-36">00:44:36</a>]  Because every time we would see my dad my mom used multiple different route taxi bus and you know

[<a id="00-44-44">00:44:44</a>]  Secret agent. Yeah, so and and is your mom has she got a boyfriend or something or?

[<a id="00-44-51">00:44:51</a>]  No, I never saw that. Maybe she did but I don't know but

[<a id="00-44-56">00:44:56</a>]  Perhaps I was she living off like well, you're in this other. Okay, so in in, Osaka

[<a id="00-45-02">00:45:02</a>]  There's a thing term called Mizu show by Mizu miss water show by miss business. It literally means water business and

[<a id="00-45-10">00:45:10</a>]  the reason why it's called that because anybody who works nighttime with a restaurant or

[<a id="00-45-15">00:45:15</a>]  Performance artists or maybe even escort they're all under one category

[<a id="00-45-21">00:45:21</a>]  the Mizu show by and it's why it's called water business because a lot of those kinds of businesses by by canal

[<a id="00-45-28">00:45:28</a>]  with the light they have a shimmering like a

[<a id="00-45-31">00:45:31</a>]  Otherworldly quality to it. Hence the water show by you know, so

[<a id="00-45-38">00:45:38</a>]  My mom was pouring alcohol at those bars and stuff and the reason I know that because one time

[<a id="00-45-42">00:45:42</a>]  So imagine your second grade your mom leaves you middle of the night. There's no babysitter

[<a id="00-45-47">00:45:47</a>]  That's how we live, you know for like second and third grade and sometimes you have to explain yourself

[<a id="00-45-52">00:45:52</a>]  You know, but I couldn't believe doing that to a kid these days like okay your second grade your brothers barely came

[<a id="00-45-59">00:45:59</a>]  You got me. I'm leaving. I'll be back in the morning or whatever. So she didn't night shift at the bar

[<a id="00-46-05">00:46:05</a>]  Those working at those club. Yeah, and just leaving us, you know, but she's so I mean

[<a id="00-46-10">00:46:10</a>]  She's basically because your dad's beating her up or something. No. No, my dad never did that

[<a id="00-46-15">00:46:15</a>]  If anything, my my dad will get hit by my mom. My dad's never been a violent guy. It's always my mom hitting my dad

[<a id="00-46-21">00:46:21</a>]  Okay, so but so she just wanted to get away like so what why why was he so repellent?

[<a id="00-46-32">00:46:32</a>]  He had multiple sister telling him what to do and

[<a id="00-46-35">00:46:35</a>]  He's not willing to do what my mom was telling him to do maybe he wasn't successful enough and also

[<a id="00-46-46">00:46:46</a>]  My mom always remind me that character found full of bears

[<a id="00-46-52">00:46:52</a>]  Madam Wolverine, she had this fantasy world where she envisioned living a better life

[<a id="00-46-58">00:46:58</a>]  maybe in entertainment singing because she was an excellent singer and a cook and

[<a id="00-47-03">00:47:03</a>]  She wanted a life that she was a bit artsy. I don't know. She's artsy, but she liked attention and things like that. Okay, and

[<a id="00-47-10">00:47:10</a>]  My dad was not yeah, he avoided it. Well, I mean she just that that's not that's not within his personality, you know

[<a id="00-47-18">00:47:18</a>]  You work in the insurance company. You're a risk averse person, you know, yeah

[<a id="00-47-23">00:47:23</a>]  So I don't know for whatever reason it didn't work out. So but then if so in a way what she's doing is

[<a id="00-47-30">00:47:30</a>]  She's escaping a role. She has to play so she's got to play the role of the mother of the family

[<a id="00-47-36">00:47:36</a>]  She hated my dad. She hated my dad's family

[<a id="00-47-39">00:47:39</a>]  She didn't like the circumstances although she probably liked living in Japan better than Korea because Japan was doing economically way better

[<a id="00-47-45">00:47:45</a>]  Incredibly well, but compared to Korea as an upgrade to then be working in bars. That's like that's kind of

[<a id="00-47-52">00:47:52</a>]  she rather work and

[<a id="00-47-54">00:47:54</a>]  Live on her own and have this guy that

[<a id="00-47-58">00:47:58</a>]  She just didn't want to be with you know, that's interesting

[<a id="00-48-01">00:48:01</a>]  So I mean that yeah for a fancy if like her dream is to be some kind of performer

[<a id="00-48-06">00:48:06</a>]  like this

[<a id="00-48-09">00:48:09</a>]  oppression of

[<a id="00-48-10">00:48:10</a>]  This I don't know. I mean maybe because I'm trying to understand too

[<a id="00-48-15">00:48:15</a>]  But these people even if you even if you ask my I mean even if my dad was alive

[<a id="00-48-20">00:48:20</a>]  He just won't answer that but he just won't say anything

[<a id="00-48-23">00:48:23</a>]  quiet, you know and then

[<a id="00-48-25">00:48:25</a>]  Man of a few words. I mean

[<a id="00-48-28">00:48:28</a>]  he just what he just wasn't very talkative and

[<a id="00-48-32">00:48:32</a>]  He doesn't say anything revealing and my mom even she's telling something. I don't know if I should believe that, you know, so anyway

[<a id="00-48-41">00:48:41</a>]  It's a bad marriage. Let's go to the second kidnapping then so the first kidnapping happened

[<a id="00-48-48">00:48:48</a>]  you're eventually my dad found a place about the place she decided to move back with my dad and

[<a id="00-48-53">00:48:53</a>]  So that's weird and that was really weird because when we moved back to the old home did you change school again, of course, yeah, yeah and

[<a id="00-49-02">00:49:02</a>]  How comfortable my mom was lying to neighbors like what were you doing? Oh, I took my kids

[<a id="00-49-09">00:49:09</a>]  We went to America. My mom was sick some bullshit. I'm so like

[<a id="00-49-12">00:49:12</a>]  That's no true. Like, you know, I'm opening my fucking mouth, you know, but

[<a id="00-49-18">00:49:18</a>]  um

[<a id="00-49-19">00:49:19</a>]  So we were living with my dad, but that didn't last really long because one night

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  We

[<a id="00-49-28">00:49:28</a>]  summer of 79

[<a id="00-49-30">00:49:30</a>]  We visited our relatives in USA

[<a id="00-49-33">00:49:33</a>]  My grandmother was was dying and I think winter was fall of 79 like a couple months after we return

[<a id="00-49-39">00:49:39</a>]  Maybe four months out. It's literally before 1980

[<a id="00-49-42">00:49:42</a>]  We got a phone call and my mom started crying. I just assumed my grandmother passed away

[<a id="00-49-48">00:49:48</a>]  and to me that was

[<a id="00-49-50">00:49:50</a>]  the beginning of the end because I think

[<a id="00-49-53">00:49:53</a>]  When I when we visit the USA for the first time summer 79, I thought okay, we're back live with that things are going

[<a id="00-50-00">00:50:00</a>]  Well, we're doing vacationing

[<a id="00-50-02">00:50:02</a>]  So I thought things are okay, and I was really really wrong in fact

[<a id="00-50-06">00:50:06</a>]  79 when we were in Hawaii

[<a id="00-50-09">00:50:09</a>]  Because it's a midpoint between USA continent was in Japan and when we went for a harbor and

[<a id="00-50-16">00:50:16</a>]  The trip was going well

[<a id="00-50-18">00:50:18</a>]  The whole time I thought oh everything's taken care of everything's gonna be okay

[<a id="00-50-23">00:50:23</a>]  And we're gonna live like a family again and that not realizing we were basically two three four months away from receiving phone call

[<a id="00-50-30">00:50:30</a>]  where my mom decided to

[<a id="00-50-32">00:50:32</a>]  get divorced and

[<a id="00-50-35">00:50:35</a>]  leave

[<a id="00-50-36">00:50:36</a>]  Because I think even for her she didn't want to get a divorce when her mom was alive, right?

[<a id="00-50-40">00:50:40</a>]  so I

[<a id="00-50-44">00:50:44</a>]  Just remember March 13 1980

[<a id="00-50-48">00:50:48</a>]  My mom said we're gonna get on the plane. Yeah, you how old?

[<a id="00-50-54">00:50:54</a>]  55 no, but how old were you at that? I think I was

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  Ten years old. I'm couple of months away from turning 11. I think

[<a id="00-51-03">00:51:03</a>]  We're gonna get on the plane. We're gonna fly from Osaka, Japan

[<a id="00-51-07">00:51:07</a>]  We were flying to Tokyo and I was like, why don't we just take shinkansen which is like bullet train rail

[<a id="00-51-12">00:51:12</a>]  I didn't understand like whatever we got on plane. We woke up next morning. We're back in Hawaii for the second time because

[<a id="00-51-17">00:51:17</a>]  That's when my mom told us

[<a id="00-51-20">00:51:20</a>]  They're divorced and we're living in States

[<a id="00-51-23">00:51:23</a>]  So yeah, and how I was just like a stopping point or were you staying there?

[<a id="00-51-30">00:51:30</a>]  Yes, he she has a older sister live in Hawaii. Okay, that's one of the reason we went to Hawaii first year and your brothers

[<a id="00-51-37">00:51:37</a>]  What seven three years younger than myself? So he's like seven years. Oh, yeah. Yeah

[<a id="00-51-42">00:51:42</a>]  so

[<a id="00-51-44">00:51:44</a>]  Of course, I didn't understand what's going on, you know, because within a couple weeks my mom went back to Japan

[<a id="00-51-50">00:51:50</a>]  I'm living with her my mom's second oldest sister Wow

[<a id="00-51-53">00:51:53</a>]  And she speak English and Korean but doesn't speak Japanese

[<a id="00-51-56">00:51:56</a>]  She have kids

[<a id="00-51-59">00:51:59</a>]  Yes, but but her kids was living with somebody else too. So the whole family is dysfunctional both sides, you know

[<a id="00-52-06">00:52:06</a>]  And we were living in Brahampton, Washington, which was very weird

[<a id="00-52-10">00:52:10</a>]  Because it's a Navy town

[<a id="00-52-13">00:52:13</a>]  U.s. This is Missouri where?

[<a id="00-52-15">00:52:15</a>]  Japanese representative signed surrender to USA. It's in that same town. There's a lot of people who fought in Pacific Theatre

[<a id="00-52-22">00:52:22</a>]  Living there. So having Japanese name wasn't really a good thing

[<a id="00-52-26">00:52:26</a>]  My brother was too young to get harassment, but I was old enough. So I'm getting called Jeff every other word every other day and

[<a id="00-52-35">00:52:35</a>]  Luckily the teacher I have happened to be Japanese American. So he was kind of perfect person

[<a id="00-52-40">00:52:40</a>]  Kind of explained to what was going on, you know, this has happened and he was mentioning something about you know

[<a id="00-52-47">00:52:47</a>]  It's the same things that happened into Vietnamese kids. I didn't even know what Vietnamese were

[<a id="00-52-50">00:52:50</a>]  They're at war

[<a id="00-52-53">00:52:53</a>]  They were at war five years prior. So they were going same thing

[<a id="00-52-56">00:52:56</a>]  So so this is actually this is your first encounter with racism in effect

[<a id="00-53-01">00:53:01</a>]  Like but you started off you're thinking they're calling me jab. This is like getting bullied at school

[<a id="00-53-07">00:53:07</a>]  Well, I mean, but then the teacher explains this is actually racism

[<a id="00-53-11">00:53:11</a>]  you know, but I didn't understand what that mean racism because my thinking like

[<a id="00-53-15">00:53:15</a>]  Because when we went to Hawaii, I learned about Pearl Harbor. I think it's only fair to call somebody jab

[<a id="00-53-22">00:53:22</a>]  I think as a kid like there's one other thing that is have you ever actually looked on the map of where Pearl Harbor is?

[<a id="00-53-30">00:53:30</a>]  Like this is such a huge drama for America. It's like like I

[<a id="00-53-34">00:53:34</a>]  Don't want to call Pearl Harbor. It ain't shit, but it ain't shit

[<a id="00-53-39">00:53:39</a>]  They like they made a lot of servicemen passed away and many Hawaiians got killed too. Sure, but yeah, yeah

[<a id="00-53-46">00:53:46</a>]  No

[<a id="00-53-48">00:53:48</a>]  My feelings I understand if your young guy fought in a war lost a Lego arm and then you have

[<a id="00-53-55">00:53:55</a>]  They it has Gran Torino vibes, right? Like yeah, where I mean if you think about 1980, that's only what?

[<a id="00-54-02">00:54:02</a>]  35 years 35 years. I graduated from high school

[<a id="00-54-07">00:54:07</a>]  36 years ago, so

[<a id="00-54-12">00:54:12</a>]  You know, it's a within reasonable amount that I met people who went through that. Oh, of course, so they're angry

[<a id="00-54-19">00:54:19</a>]  And I didn't understand they didn't work through their PTSD either as we know

[<a id="00-54-25">00:54:25</a>]  Yeah, so and I'm used to having people angry with me all the time. So this is like, you know, yeah

[<a id="00-54-31">00:54:31</a>]  So it's not perfect, but they're always mad at me for something, you know

[<a id="00-54-35">00:54:35</a>]  Did you did you start feeling like making someone mad?

[<a id="00-54-39">00:54:39</a>]  Is is kind of that's the only emotion that you can get in the first place

[<a id="00-54-43">00:54:43</a>]  I'm trying to remember why why I behaved the way I did but I

[<a id="00-54-53">00:54:53</a>]  Don't know I mean how would you describe how you're behaving like were you

[<a id="00-54-59">00:54:59</a>]  You're using techniques. You learn to like navigate other people's

[<a id="00-55-04">00:55:04</a>]  To to I guess avoid getting beaten up or whatever. Well, I I do remember

[<a id="00-55-10">00:55:10</a>]  One time I was what I think for one of the first month or two even like the first week or something I

[<a id="00-55-18">00:55:18</a>]  Dropped a

[<a id="00-55-22">00:55:22</a>]  Bag of coughs drop and

[<a id="00-55-24">00:55:24</a>]  I'm as I'm getting

[<a id="00-55-27">00:55:27</a>]  Trying to pick it up. I can't remember. It's a boy or girl. Just came up and just stomping the shit out of it

[<a id="00-55-32">00:55:32</a>]  and it's a cough so it's and so they

[<a id="00-55-36">00:55:36</a>]  Yeah, take that jab and just walked away laughing Wow. Yeah

[<a id="00-55-40">00:55:40</a>]  And I don't know what

[<a id="00-55-43">00:55:43</a>]  What that meant, you know, like a couple years after I'm not gonna say the word but a couple years after I was in Tacoma

[<a id="00-55-49">00:55:49</a>]  Washington which is like an hour away where my uncle and aunt live. Sure. I saw a black guy. He used the n-word at me

[<a id="00-55-55">00:55:55</a>]  So he said hi n-word, right? I never heard that word before so I'm not a cool kid

[<a id="00-56-02">00:56:02</a>]  So I thought that's how I say I thought it was hell. Yes

[<a id="00-56-05">00:56:05</a>]  So I thought it was like howdy or something

[<a id="00-56-07">00:56:07</a>]  So I say hi and we're back at that person because I never heard that word, you know

[<a id="00-56-12">00:56:12</a>]  I never heard that word and so the heat hurt his face change

[<a id="00-56-16">00:56:16</a>]  I've seen that face before I ran because that's before you get punched the faith

[<a id="00-56-20">00:56:20</a>]  Universal look right so I I think I had to learn these things, you know

[<a id="00-56-27">00:56:27</a>]  like my uncle who was married to my aunt married to my

[<a id="00-56-30">00:56:30</a>]  mom's older sister and

[<a id="00-56-32">00:56:32</a>]  His wife is Norwegian. He was telling me don't say those words

[<a id="00-56-38">00:56:38</a>]  But if you do say those words

[<a id="00-56-41">00:56:41</a>]  Make sure you look around

[<a id="00-56-43">00:56:43</a>]  There he's not there and this is what he said because they have a superior

[<a id="00-56-48">00:56:48</a>]  Hearing ability like they're fucking animals or something, but he's always joking around. He's a lawyer

[<a id="00-56-53">00:56:53</a>]  He's saying terrible things like that, you know, he was so sarcastic and dark, you know

[<a id="00-56-58">00:56:58</a>]  and

[<a id="00-57-00">00:57:00</a>]  But this is the second time you're confronted with like a completely different culture again

[<a id="00-57-05">00:57:05</a>]  So you have I guess you're right. Yeah, you have the cultural

[<a id="00-57-10">00:57:10</a>]  imbalance to say on when you're growing up Japan Korean

[<a id="00-57-15">00:57:15</a>]  Whatever that is your dad probably being the best but I but you know

[<a id="00-57-21">00:57:21</a>]  I don't really I didn't think like an intellectual level like I don't get it. I don't understand. Why why is it this way?

[<a id="00-57-26">00:57:26</a>]  You know, no, but that's that's what I'm trying to get at. It's you're trying to navigate something that no one ever explains

[<a id="00-57-33">00:57:33</a>]  Yes with my family when you do something bad they hit you but they never tell you ahead of time

[<a id="00-57-39">00:57:39</a>]  You shouldn't do that. Exactly. So it's you're very reactive. There is not proactive. You know, yeah, there's never an explanation

[<a id="00-57-45">00:57:45</a>]  No, then you're going to the States. Yeah, which is a vastly different culture again

[<a id="00-57-52">00:57:52</a>]  You multiple cultures sure exactly you're experiencing racism the first time. I mean, whatever

[<a id="00-57-59">00:57:59</a>]  I mean, I didn't understand that but that

[<a id="00-58-01">00:58:01</a>]  It's not the boogeyman that people make it out there for me, you know, but it's I didn't like it

[<a id="00-58-07">00:58:07</a>]  it's just fascinating because like

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  Who do you talk to like at this point? Who do you talk to who do you confide in?

[<a id="00-58-13">00:58:13</a>]  No one no one so it's because my family what about your brother? He's too young, you know, he's too young

[<a id="00-58-20">00:58:20</a>]  He was cute kid. He didn't really get picked on

[<a id="00-58-22">00:58:22</a>]  but so you were the shithead and

[<a id="00-58-25">00:58:25</a>]  You got punched on I know I'm old enough to know that even I had a problem

[<a id="00-58-31">00:58:31</a>]  That's not something you talked your brother because I'm burdened him with that, right?

[<a id="00-58-35">00:58:35</a>]  Okay, so you're the older brother. You're the protector in a way kind of yeah

[<a id="00-58-39">00:58:39</a>]  Did you feel like you have to take over a role in that house when you lived in the States?

[<a id="00-58-45">00:58:45</a>]  Did you take over the role as the dad of the family as well?

[<a id="00-58-48">00:58:48</a>]  I don't I don't know but I mean when I was second grade when my mom left though for the rest of the night working

[<a id="00-58-53">00:58:53</a>]  Yeah, that was really uncomfortable, you know, yeah and

[<a id="00-58-57">00:58:57</a>]  That was a really really weird because I didn't have a parent to help me with homework

[<a id="00-59-04">00:59:04</a>]  Sometime I go back to school and teacher get mad but lady that showed you the tits that she don't help with the homework. No

[<a id="00-59-10">00:59:10</a>]  No

[<a id="00-59-13">00:59:13</a>]  Yeah, that was a very strange time because I think

[<a id="00-59-17">00:59:17</a>]  But you've kind of got this Norwegian guy. Is he's kind of being oh, that's in the States. Yeah. Yeah

[<a id="00-59-24">00:59:24</a>]  In Hawaii said with him. He's like no, he's in Tacoma, Washington

[<a id="00-59-30">00:59:30</a>]  Okay, how I was look a little before we moved to mainland. Yeah, how long did you stay in Hawaii?

[<a id="00-59-35">00:59:35</a>]  Very sure what we could maybe three. All right, so it was just a stopping point and then it was all off to Washington

[<a id="00-59-41">00:59:41</a>]  Yeah, I just had an uncle now to live there, right? Yeah

[<a id="00-59-44">00:59:44</a>]  so I

[<a id="00-59-46">00:59:46</a>]  Didn't understand we were in Hawaii. I

[<a id="00-59-48">00:59:48</a>]  Didn't I didn't know that people spoke different. I thought everyone spoke Japanese

[<a id="00-59-52">00:59:52</a>]  I thought black and white people are just imagination because I saw on TV by never saw them

[<a id="00-59-57">00:59:57</a>]  So I didn't know they're real and you're thinking they've over a little stars under the cars

[<a id="01-00-01">01:00:01</a>]  yeah, it's and genitals and I

[<a id="01-00-05">01:00:05</a>]  Remember because my dad was kind of funny guy too. So I remember we're going urinals and there was a black guy and

[<a id="01-00-12">01:00:12</a>]  Here we go. He look over it start clapping because he guy had a big copper

[<a id="01-00-17">01:00:17</a>]  Whatever my dad was a really funny guy. So I start clapping. I don't know why could you see your dad doing it?

[<a id="01-00-25">01:00:25</a>]  But yeah, just just seeing so many different kinds of people it's just shocked me and

[<a id="01-00-30">01:00:30</a>]  It just like just imagine when the youth that everyone looks same like you and that's it that you think like there's another country

[<a id="01-00-40">01:00:40</a>]  Where they speak different languages in different way if you're just shocking to me as a kid

[<a id="01-00-45">01:00:45</a>]  You know how much how much English have you got at this point when you nothing nothing except one more n-word, okay?

[<a id="01-00-52">01:00:52</a>]  That's it's a very good site. It's all it's like my first word in English

[<a id="01-00-57">01:00:57</a>]  The word is nuclear. Hey, there we go

[<a id="01-01-03">01:01:03</a>]  So, but you're thrown into school immediately as soon as you land in the

[<a id="01-01-09">01:01:09</a>]  when I got kidnapped, yeah, and that was really I'm just

[<a id="01-01-13">01:01:13</a>]  It was really really

[<a id="01-01-18">01:01:18</a>]  Confusing, you know what one time?

[<a id="01-01-22">01:01:22</a>]  My uncle who was married to my aunt

[<a id="01-01-24">01:01:24</a>]  He he yeah, do you know that story about

[<a id="01-01-30">01:01:30</a>]  Conquistador the Spanish they appear in Latin America sure and they appeared and

[<a id="01-01-39">01:01:39</a>]  They trying to impress the native by saying

[<a id="01-01-44">01:01:44</a>]  Tomorrow our great wizard will make the Sun disappear. Well, what happens they knew the knowledge eclipsed next day

[<a id="01-01-52">01:01:52</a>]  so

[<a id="01-01-54">01:01:54</a>]  Our God Jesus give us power to make the Sun disappear did laugh but of course eclipse happened, right, right, so

[<a id="01-02-02">01:02:02</a>]  That really shocked the native, you know, sure like they have power whatever. I remember one year my uncle

[<a id="01-02-08">01:02:08</a>]  This is typical my family

[<a id="01-02-10">01:02:10</a>]  my uncle said there's a new policy at school and

[<a id="01-02-14">01:02:14</a>]  Everybody must dress in

[<a id="01-02-18">01:02:18</a>]  In really weird outfit, so he took me early in the morning

[<a id="01-02-23">01:02:23</a>]  I'm like, why am I coming home school so early?

[<a id="01-02-26">01:02:26</a>]  And I'm sitting in the middle of the room and then all of a sudden

[<a id="01-02-30">01:02:30</a>]  The teacher walks in with like big hat

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  black patch and a hook and

[<a id="01-02-38">01:02:38</a>]  I think he had a bird on his shoulder and all of a sudden all the kids walk in

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  different outfits

[<a id="01-02-47">01:02:47</a>]  Spider-man

[<a id="01-02-48">01:02:48</a>]  fireman

[<a id="01-02-49">01:02:49</a>]  Dada and I'm just confused. What kind of school did he go to?

[<a id="01-02-52">01:02:52</a>]  I'm just confused. Well, what happened was it was Halloween. Of course, nobody he didn't tell me we just had a new change of policy

[<a id="01-03-00">01:03:00</a>]  So he's okay, he's a cunt it's funny. Oh, no, no it get worse

[<a id="01-03-08">01:03:08</a>]  He told me it's gonna be like that every single day from now. Yes

[<a id="01-03-12">01:03:12</a>]  Yes, okay funny actually on Monday. I dressed us as a Batman. Yeah, and everybody's just regular

[<a id="01-03-20">01:03:20</a>]  So my family always this shit like that like my mother gave me

[<a id="01-03-24">01:03:24</a>]  This he's Norwegian. He's just Norwegian lawyer. Oh, no. No, this is different guy

[<a id="01-03-30">01:03:30</a>]  My mother had multiple sisters with different partners

[<a id="01-03-33">01:03:33</a>]  So

[<a id="01-03-37">01:03:37</a>]  They would do stuff like this

[<a id="01-03-38">01:03:38</a>]  Like my mom one time I asked her I I don't know why but the time when I was a kid

[<a id="01-03-44">01:03:44</a>]  I wanted such a gate thing to ask one of those really weird hat look like a sailors hat

[<a id="01-03-49">01:03:49</a>]  So she said I'll get you the hat if you get a haircut so thinking like regular haircut this fucking bitch

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  Give me borderline afro like hair right in 70. So I look like Jackson 6. I look like one of the Jackson

[<a id="01-04-05">01:04:05</a>]  So, of course, I'm crying because you don't want to stick out in Japan. Yeah, my mother always think thing

[<a id="01-04-11">01:04:11</a>]  She doesn't understand your job is to make our lives better and easier

[<a id="01-04-16">01:04:16</a>]  Prepare us for future. She never did that. Yeah, so of course I go back

[<a id="01-04-21">01:04:21</a>]  School next day with fucking afro looks like and of course I get picked on more, you know, so there was always a

[<a id="01-04-30">01:04:30</a>]  bit of a

[<a id="01-04-32">01:04:32</a>]  Disorient feeling with my family and then what the way I grow up

[<a id="01-04-35">01:04:35</a>]  I think that's what's like semi on purpose in a way. It's just like let's not just talk about shit

[<a id="01-04-41">01:04:41</a>]  Let's just there are some parents do something weird to prepare their kids. That's not why they did it

[<a id="01-04-47">01:04:47</a>]  They just don't give a fuck. Yeah, they're smoking cigarette drinking beer think it's funny, you know, it's that kind of shit

[<a id="01-04-54">01:04:54</a>]  Yeah, that's that's the that's the environment grow up, you know, they're just yellow trash if there's white trash this yellow trash

[<a id="01-05-00">01:05:00</a>]  I grow up. They're all yellow trash

[<a id="01-05-03">01:05:03</a>]  I'm telling you that's what I call this. So you're in a way like you're there as a form of entertainment for them

[<a id="01-05-10">01:05:10</a>]  I really was a monkey to my mom. Yeah, so it was a lot of that stuff, but I think

[<a id="01-05-17">01:05:17</a>]  Because of that, I think I was more

[<a id="01-05-21">01:05:21</a>]  Tolerant of different kinds of people and different ideas, you know, yeah, I think this is a perfect moment to

[<a id="01-05-28">01:05:28</a>]  To take a break here. How much time is that? Yeah, we did an hour. So already. Yeah, he's got a room

[<a id="01-05-35">01:05:35</a>]  We will we will continue from from school days
