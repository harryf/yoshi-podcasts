[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  [ Silence ]

[<a id="00-00-17">00:00:17</a>]  >> All right, so yeah, you asked me before about how I started working with Harry.

[<a id="00-00-28">00:00:28</a>]  >> Well, first of all, good morning.

[<a id="00-00-30">00:00:30</a>]  >> Good morning.

[<a id="00-00-31">00:00:31</a>]  >> November 23rd, I just want to give context.

[<a id="00-00-34">00:00:34</a>]  >> Still trying to get awake here.

[<a id="00-00-36">00:00:36</a>]  >> Yeah, 9.44 a.m. We're actually pretty early on because we were planning to 11 a.m.

[<a id="00-00-41">00:00:41</a>]  and I just got here barely 24 hours ago.

[<a id="00-00-45">00:00:45</a>]  >> Yeah, yeah, true.

[<a id="00-00-46">00:00:46</a>]  How do you feel now?

[<a id="00-00-47">00:00:47</a>]  >> I feel a lot better.

[<a id="00-00-48">00:00:48</a>]  Boy, the last three days were pretty hectic because I was sleeping basically two

[<a id="00-00-54">00:00:54</a>]  to three hours every day.

[<a id="00-00-57">00:00:57</a>]  There was a scheduling change, so I had to make adjustments, you know.

[<a id="00-01-03">00:01:03</a>]  Originally, I was going to stay in the Netherlands for a couple days, then come over here,

[<a id="00-01-06">00:01:06</a>]  but I saw Mark Rylance performing in London, so I changed my plan.

[<a id="00-01-12">00:01:12</a>]  But I run a trip ticket to Amsterdam, to London, back to continent Europe,

[<a id="00-01-18">00:01:18</a>]  so I could see two shows, and yeah, that created a lot of headache.

[<a id="00-01-25">00:01:25</a>]  I was supposed to see a couple more friends, but I took Mark Rylance over those people,

[<a id="00-01-30">00:01:30</a>]  you know, and I think this is probably true for all of us.

[<a id="00-01-35">00:01:35</a>]  Like whenever you see somebody performing at the highest level, whether it's a stand-up comedy

[<a id="00-01-39">00:01:39</a>]  or acting or sports, that's something I'm really willing to pay in person to see.

[<a id="00-01-44">00:01:44</a>]  >> Oh, absolutely.

[<a id="00-01-45">00:01:45</a>]  >> And, you know, Mark Rylance, you know, he's one of the greatest actors and one

[<a id="00-01-51">00:01:51</a>]  of the generation of Italian Shakespearean plays and things like that, you know.

[<a id="00-01-56">00:01:56</a>]  He won an Oscar in 2007 with Tom Hanks and --

[<a id="00-01-59">00:01:59</a>]  >> Is this something that you're interested in, in general, theater?

[<a id="00-02-05">00:02:05</a>]  >> It wasn't.

[<a id="00-02-07">00:02:07</a>]  It kind of changed, you know, for me.

[<a id="00-02-09">00:02:09</a>]  I think -- I saw an interview one time with Ian McKellen, you know, one of the --

[<a id="00-02-16">00:02:16</a>]  >> Oh, yeah.

[<a id="00-02-17">00:02:17</a>]  >> -- one of the finest actor period, and he's gay, not surprising in theater,

[<a id="00-02-25">00:02:25</a>]  but he was saying that growing up in the UK, I know gay actors like redundant, you know,

[<a id="00-02-31">00:02:31</a>]  like Asian engineers or something, or Asian pervert, you know, redundant.

[<a id="00-02-38">00:02:38</a>]  But he said that, you know, growing up in the UK as a gay man and how society looked down

[<a id="00-02-44">00:02:44</a>]  on them and think they're literally a perversion from nature, treated poorly,

[<a id="00-02-50">00:02:50</a>]  and he wasn't able to talk about these things because, you know, it was a different era.

[<a id="00-02-53">00:02:53</a>]  He said that there's only one place where he could be himself, which is theater,

[<a id="00-02-59">00:02:59</a>]  where you could show all kinds of emotions, you know.

[<a id="00-03-01">00:03:01</a>]  And I think when I heard that, I feel so much empathy for the guy.

[<a id="00-03-08">00:03:08</a>]  So, it's -- they're drawn to things not because it's like a casual thing.

[<a id="00-03-16">00:03:16</a>]  It has something really heavy and meaningful to them, you know.

[<a id="00-03-19">00:03:19</a>]  So, when he explained it as a gay person, and I tried to put myself in their shoes, like, wow,

[<a id="00-03-24">00:03:24</a>]  I didn't realize that, and when I see him and others perform at such a high level,

[<a id="00-03-34">00:03:34</a>]  it's incredible, you know, and I think it really changed for me because learning

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  to express your feelings and things that really bother you, I come from a culture

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  that you're not supposed to express those things.

[<a id="00-03-46">00:03:46</a>]  >> You're not supposed to express culture and emotions at all, which is --

[<a id="00-03-49">00:03:49</a>]  >> I mean, you -- I think you could express, especially in like Korean culture,

[<a id="00-03-53">00:03:53</a>]  like anger and stuff, but something that is like painful or you're sad or hurt,

[<a id="00-04-00">00:04:00</a>]  especially as a man, you don't show -- you're not supposed to show that.

[<a id="00-04-04">00:04:04</a>]  So, when I see a guy like him, why he did it at the highest level, yeah,

[<a id="00-04-13">00:04:13</a>]  I always thought theaters and musicals are gay and stupid, but I think something happens

[<a id="00-04-19">00:04:19</a>]  when you get older, you know, you change, your tastes change, you know,

[<a id="00-04-22">00:04:22</a>]  and I think it really helped me lost -- I would say like late 2000s, but when I lost my job,

[<a id="00-04-30">00:04:30</a>]  it became like a little bit of obsession, you know.

[<a id="00-04-33">00:04:33</a>]  >> Yeah. Do you ever -- when you're going on stage, when you do comedy, do you ever try

[<a id="00-04-42">00:04:42</a>]  to work like an actor, as in, you know, sometimes in comedy, you have people that just go on,

[<a id="00-04-50">00:04:50</a>]  they tell the joke, they're done, and then you see how they progress.

[<a id="00-04-54">00:04:54</a>]  They become a little bit more theatrical, and that's the guys that come from stand-up comedy,

[<a id="00-04-59">00:04:59</a>]  and sometimes you have the other way around, like people that come from acting,

[<a id="00-05-03">00:05:03</a>]  and they first start with acting, and then the jokes kind of like start to build,

[<a id="00-05-07">00:05:07</a>]  but have you started to employ some of those lessons, I want to say?

[<a id="00-05-15">00:05:15</a>]  >> You know, when I was a young kid, even thinking about stand-up comedy,

[<a id="00-05-21">00:05:21</a>]  I was wrong about so many different things, you know.

[<a id="00-05-25">00:05:25</a>]  >> What do you mean?

[<a id="00-05-28">00:05:28</a>]  What do you mean you were wrong about so many things?

[<a id="00-05-31">00:05:31</a>]  >> For a long time, I hated everything Andy Kaufman was doing.

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  I thought it was fucking stupid, you know, but I think -- I don't know if this makes sense.

[<a id="00-05-43">00:05:43</a>]  You know, I knew a guy named David Cho, who was a street artist, very good at art, right,

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  and he was explaining to me one time, I don't know exactly what he said, but like Picasso,

[<a id="00-05-54">00:05:54</a>]  he first learned to draw realistically picturing people,

[<a id="00-05-57">00:05:57</a>]  and his technique was just incredible, you know.

[<a id="00-06-00">00:06:00</a>]  When he drew something, it looked like a real thing, but when he got older

[<a id="00-06-04">00:06:04</a>]  and experienced life, he started drawing this

[<a id="00-06-06">00:06:06</a>]  with like a really weird cartoonish abstract work, but you can only do that after you master the basic

[<a id="00-06-14">00:06:14</a>]  and all the technical skills, right, and I didn't understand

[<a id="00-06-18">00:06:18</a>]  that abstract theory behind Kaufman, what he was doing.

[<a id="00-06-20">00:06:20</a>]  I just thought he was just being an asshole, whatever, right?

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  >> Right.

[<a id="00-06-23">00:06:23</a>]  >> And I think years of doing stand-up, like, oh.

[<a id="00-06-26">00:06:26</a>]  >> Now I get it.

[<a id="00-06-27">00:06:27</a>]  >> I get it.

[<a id="00-06-28">00:06:28</a>]  >> Yeah. Have you ever been in a situation where a girl actually was interested in you and liked you,

[<a id="00-06-33">00:06:33</a>]  she was giving you all the signs, but you're too stupid to notice?

[<a id="00-06-35">00:06:35</a>]  >> Yes, yes.

[<a id="00-06-36">00:06:36</a>]  >> And then she's like, oh, she liked -- I didn't realize that.

[<a id="00-06-39">00:06:39</a>]  >> Yeah, that's what she wanted.

[<a id="00-06-41">00:06:41</a>]  >> Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-41">00:06:41</a>]  >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

[<a id="00-06-43">00:06:43</a>]  >> I get it now.

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  >> Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-44">00:06:44</a>]  >> So that's a little different, but what I don't like is when I see a stand-up comic,

[<a id="00-06-50">00:06:50</a>]  especially someone new, they're really expressing wow, not because that's their style

[<a id="00-06-57">00:06:57</a>]  or they reach certain maturity.

[<a id="00-06-58">00:06:58</a>]  They do that because they don't have anything important to say or funny to say,

[<a id="00-07-02">00:07:02</a>]  so they have to get loud.

[<a id="00-07-03">00:07:03</a>]  I don't like that.

[<a id="00-07-04">00:07:04</a>]  >> Oh, yeah.

[<a id="00-07-05">00:07:05</a>]  >> That's a big difference, I think, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-07-07">00:07:07</a>]  >> But that is also a little bit part of what you would call trying

[<a id="00-07-14">00:07:14</a>]  to find who you are on stage, right?

[<a id="00-07-16">00:07:16</a>]  Like, especially in the early years, a lot of people, we see it here in the scene

[<a id="00-07-23">00:07:23</a>]  in Zurich quite a lot, and we think it's a positive thing.

[<a id="00-07-27">00:07:27</a>]  People try shit, you know?

[<a id="00-07-29">00:07:29</a>]  Like, you go out there, you work, and it's like, hey, am I the one-liner guy

[<a id="00-07-34">00:07:34</a>]  or am I the storytelling guy?

[<a id="00-07-35">00:07:35</a>]  >> Sure.

[<a id="00-07-35">00:07:35</a>]  >> It starts with that.

[<a id="00-07-36">00:07:36</a>]  Am I the loud cunt?

[<a id="00-07-38">00:07:38</a>]  Am I the sweary guy?

[<a id="00-07-40">00:07:40</a>]  Am I the clean guy?

[<a id="00-07-41">00:07:41</a>]  Like, all these sort of things.

[<a id="00-07-43">00:07:43</a>]  And I think, especially people that start comedy, they should do that.

[<a id="00-07-50">00:07:50</a>]  Like, just do as much as you want and see what sticks.

[<a id="00-07-55">00:07:55</a>]  I know what you mean, though, about just being loud for loudness sake.

[<a id="00-07-59">00:07:59</a>]  It usually starts with, like, oh, I literally have no joke.

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  >> Yeah.

[<a id="00-08-04">00:08:04</a>]  >> But I want to be on stage, so how do I do that?

[<a id="00-08-08">00:08:08</a>]  >> I would never tell somebody to do something on stage,

[<a id="00-08-11">00:08:11</a>]  because I think once they're on, I think that's their time, you know?

[<a id="00-08-14">00:08:14</a>]  And even if they're doing something I don't like or I don't agree with,

[<a id="00-08-17">00:08:17</a>]  it's not my place to say, you know, because you never know.

[<a id="00-08-20">00:08:20</a>]  Because I think, David, what's his name?

[<a id="00-08-27">00:08:27</a>]  Sarcastic stand-up comic, SNL, he was partner with Chris Farley, David Spade.

[<a id="00-08-35">00:08:35</a>]  >> Yes, okay, yeah.

[<a id="00-08-36">00:08:36</a>]  >> I remember, I think he was, like, working, figuring out how to do stand-up,

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  and I think one time he was just being kind of sarcastic,

[<a id="00-08-42">00:08:42</a>]  the trademark thing that he does.

[<a id="00-08-43">00:08:43</a>]  I think Dennis Miller said, like, that's you.

[<a id="00-08-46">00:08:46</a>]  >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-08-47">00:08:47</a>]  >> And it kind of worked out for me, you know?

[<a id="00-08-50">00:08:50</a>]  So, like, you're asking me the questions, like, do I do theater stuff?

[<a id="00-08-54">00:08:54</a>]  I don't like, kind of, forced thing, and that's not my thing.

[<a id="00-08-59">00:08:59</a>]  But you know what I like, sometimes comedians can play, like, in a circumstance

[<a id="00-09-04">00:09:04</a>]  where it's a small room with only a few people in.

[<a id="00-09-07">00:09:07</a>]  I kind of like those two, because I think when you have a small room and small crowd,

[<a id="00-09-14">00:09:14</a>]  you could just kind of talk to them, you know?

[<a id="00-09-17">00:09:17</a>]  And I've seen so many shows over the years.

[<a id="00-09-21">00:09:21</a>]  And you could do storytelling, and sometimes you could just start talking things

[<a id="00-09-25">00:09:25</a>]  that you had an idea to talk about something, and they're kind of receptive to that, you know?

[<a id="00-09-31">00:09:31</a>]  >> And you just kind of, you can basically work out the idea in front of them.

[<a id="00-09-34">00:09:34</a>]  >> Sure, and I think, I just don't like when a comedian's a little rapey on stage, like,

[<a id="00-09-42">00:09:42</a>]  you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-09-44">00:09:44</a>]  >> Yes.

[<a id="00-09-45">00:09:45</a>]  >> Just kind of beating the audience, like, dude, it's funny.

[<a id="00-09-48">00:09:48</a>]  I don't really like that, you know?

[<a id="00-09-50">00:09:50</a>]  I think you have to respect the audience and give them an opportunity to be generous with you.

[<a id="00-09-58">00:09:58</a>]  But like, screaming and forcing people, I just hated that shit, you know?

[<a id="00-10-03">00:10:03</a>]  But I think if you have some idea to talk about on stage, and you do it,

[<a id="00-10-07">00:10:07</a>]  you'd be surprised how many times that actually worked.

[<a id="00-10-10">00:10:10</a>]  Because I think, I really didn't know what I was doing when I went to Edinburgh,

[<a id="00-10-14">00:10:14</a>]  the Fringe, last year.

[<a id="00-10-15">00:10:15</a>]  >> Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-16">00:10:16</a>]  >> And by the time --

[<a id="00-10-17">00:10:17</a>]  >> You did a whole run at Edinburgh, yeah.

[<a id="00-10-19">00:10:19</a>]  >> Yeah, I had no idea, and it just kind of worked out.

[<a id="00-10-23">00:10:23</a>]  Basically, the day I did my first show, it's exactly 20th of March,

[<a id="00-10-29">00:10:29</a>]  I got an email from Japan saying my dad died.

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  >> Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-33">00:10:33</a>]  >> Yeah, and that had an impact, you know?

[<a id="00-10-35">00:10:35</a>]  And I think every August, it's always been rough thinking about it, you know?

[<a id="00-10-40">00:10:40</a>]  Because we found his body in August of 2003, but we don't know exactly what day he passed away.

[<a id="00-10-44">00:10:44</a>]  >> Right.

[<a id="00-10-45">00:10:45</a>]  >> I know the day I got an email, and so it's always like,

[<a id="00-10-50">00:10:50</a>]  it can get a little easier, I guess, but August has always been rough.

[<a id="00-10-54">00:10:54</a>]  I have to say, last year, August was one, I think was one

[<a id="00-10-58">00:10:58</a>]  of my favorite Augusts for the whole time.

[<a id="00-11-00">00:11:00</a>]  Because I did a show, it made me nervous.

[<a id="00-11-02">00:11:02</a>]  I was doing something that I wasn't really comfortable with, but I was in Scotland,

[<a id="00-11-07">00:11:07</a>]  it was very cool weather, I had a wonderful situation, and I enjoyed it a lot.

[<a id="00-11-15">00:11:15</a>]  And when I wasn't doing a show, I was able to see other people doing shows.

[<a id="00-11-18">00:11:18</a>]  >> Yes.

[<a id="00-11-19">00:11:19</a>]  >> And that was so revelation to me, because they were doing so many weird shows,

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  like it really expanded my imagination, you know?

[<a id="00-11-28">00:11:28</a>]  Just like when I was talking to Harry yesterday about two girls, one cup, you know?

[<a id="00-11-34">00:11:34</a>]  It expands your imagination in so many different ways, yeah.

[<a id="00-11-37">00:11:37</a>]  >> So, but this is what the Fringe is great for.

[<a id="00-11-40">00:11:40</a>]  Like, the level of creativity and output that's just put into this one city

[<a id="00-11-49">00:11:49</a>]  for four weeks is insane.

[<a id="00-11-51">00:11:51</a>]  >> It's insane, and it's really shocking to me, because every day I'll find a new building,

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  and each building have three or four floors, and each floor have multiple rooms,

[<a id="00-12-01">00:12:01</a>]  and people are doing all kinds of shit, every fucking minute of it, you know?

[<a id="00-12-04">00:12:04</a>]  >> There's thousands and thousands of shows, and you're there.

[<a id="00-12-08">00:12:08</a>]  So, I find that interesting.

[<a id="00-12-11">00:12:11</a>]  So, you know that August is a shit month for you, because of what happened to you.

[<a id="00-12-16">00:12:16</a>]  You're thrust into this.

[<a id="00-12-19">00:12:19</a>]  You made a choice.

[<a id="00-12-20">00:12:20</a>]  >> I put myself in there, yeah.

[<a id="00-12-22">00:12:22</a>]  >> Sure. But when you're at Edinburgh, it feels a little bit like, yes,

[<a id="00-12-27">00:12:27</a>]  you made the choice to be there, but you're still thrust in it, because there is a lot

[<a id="00-12-32">00:12:32</a>]  of stuff that's beyond your control.

[<a id="00-12-33">00:12:33</a>]  >> Yeah.

[<a id="00-12-34">00:12:34</a>]  >> And you're, you're, ah, hang on.
