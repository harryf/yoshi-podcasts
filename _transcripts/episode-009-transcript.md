# Transcript

[<a id="00-00-00">00:00:00</a>]  It's just too, it's too, it's too upper class for porn, if you see what I mean.

[<a id="00-00-07">00:00:07</a>]  [Laughter]

[<a id="00-00-09">00:00:09</a>]  Now, if there'd been like a, if there could have been like a sophisticated form of porn

[<a id="00-00-15">00:00:15</a>]  where you needed a degree to get into it, maybe this is a thing, there's still a niche for that.

[<a id="00-00-27">00:00:27</a>]  It's very, mm, upper class all porn.

[<a id="00-00-31">00:00:31</a>]  Yeah, but it's because, because if you think about, if you think about BDSM and this kind of stuff,

[<a id="00-00-40">00:00:40</a>]  yeah, that's like a basic level, but to me, to me, the most fascinating ladies I've been with

[<a id="00-00-48">00:00:48</a>]  are the ones where, where you know they could psychologically really fuck you up.

[<a id="00-00-56">00:00:56</a>]  And there's a, there's an element to that, that's, that's hot, because it's partly for me as a challenge.

[<a id="00-01-03">00:01:03</a>]  Like, like, you know, I used to play a lot of board games as a kid, so I'm like, I bet I can outsmart this woman.

[<a id="00-01-11">00:01:11</a>]  And I can't, but still, because, but there's, there's that aspect to it.

[<a id="00-01-15">00:01:15</a>]  There's one thing, it's like, you know, the physical act of sex, but it's more the, the intellectual fucking.

[<a id="00-01-22">00:01:22</a>]  That's the, that's missing from porn, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-01-28">00:01:28</a>]  It's there in, it's there in like artistic things, you know, like, like French movies and this kind of shit, but,

[<a id="00-01-36">00:01:36</a>]  yeah, but they don't, they lack the, they don't go all in.

[<a id="00-01-40">00:01:40</a>]  It needs to be, it needs to have that intellectual level, but still be as vulgar as real porn.

[<a id="00-01-44">00:01:44</a>]  Can I just, is this already recorded?

[<a id="00-01-46">00:01:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-01-46">00:01:46</a>]  Oh, it's been going, okay.

[<a id="00-01-49">00:01:49</a>]  I, I switched it on when Harry started ranting about it.

[<a id="00-01-52">00:01:52</a>]  Yeah, he's like, yeah, this is evidence that can be used.

[<a id="00-01-55">00:01:55</a>]  Oh, I could say it's just, just think off of power of editing.

[<a id="00-01-59">00:01:59</a>]  Ha, ha, ha.

[<a id="00-02-02">00:02:02</a>]  It is the director's medium.

[<a id="00-02-04">00:02:04</a>]  Mm-hmm.

[<a id="00-02-07">00:02:07</a>]  What do you think we, we recorded about five, seven hours so far?

[<a id="00-02-10">00:02:10</a>]  Um, I mean, I've got it all on that, on that SD thing, I sorted them all out.

[<a id="00-02-15">00:02:15</a>]  It's, I think we're at eight hours of podcasts.

[<a id="00-02-19">00:02:19</a>]  Wow.

[<a id="00-02-19">00:02:19</a>]  Plus we recorded.

[<a id="00-02-21">00:02:21</a>]  So it's about maybe 30 minutes of useful footage.

[<a id="00-02-26">00:02:26</a>]  Yeah, and then also, also, also, uh, we got, we recorded, we recorded you doing the shows.

[<a id="00-02-33">00:02:33</a>]  So.

[<a id="00-02-33">00:02:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-02-34">00:02:34</a>]  Um, so we can, we can edit in some bits of you offending everyone.

[<a id="00-02-39">00:02:39</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-02-41">00:02:41</a>]  This almost looked like a retarded version of that, that, uh, interrogation from True Detective.

[<a id="00-02-45">00:02:45</a>]  It does, doesn't it?

[<a id="00-02-46">00:02:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-02-47">00:02:47</a>]  Actually, we should just have the lights behind us, I guess.

[<a id="00-02-49">00:02:49</a>]  Actually, do you know what, what, I just thought of a concept for the whole, the whole cut.

[<a id="00-02-54">00:02:54</a>]  What was that, what was that movie about the, the heavy metal band that was awful?

[<a id="00-02-59">00:02:59</a>]  It's a famous, it was a spoof movie about heavy metal.

[<a id="00-03-02">00:03:02</a>]  The English one, the one that goes, um, where, that goes to 11.

[<a id="00-03-07">00:03:07</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-03-08">00:03:08</a>]  Is that what we're talking about?

[<a id="00-03-08">00:03:08</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-03-09">00:03:09</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-03-09">00:03:09</a>]  And maybe this is the concept.

[<a id="00-03-11">00:03:11</a>]  It's like a bad comedy version of it, introducing Yoshi as this famous comedian, Spinal Tap.

[<a id="00-03-20">00:03:20</a>]  Stop saying that, I really hate when you do that.

[<a id="00-03-22">00:03:22</a>]  Jesus Christ.

[<a id="00-03-23">00:03:23</a>]  And then he gets up on stage and it's just, it's just, uh, it's just pure bombing.

[<a id="00-03-28">00:03:28</a>]  And then we're recording podcasts when nothing makes sense.

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  So did you, did you bond the other night?

[<a id="00-03-34">00:03:34</a>]  No, no, no, no.

[<a id="00-03-35">00:03:35</a>]  No, it started really, really well, but, um, I got a little carried away at the end

[<a id="00-03-39">00:03:39</a>]  and, um, yeah.

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  So how many, how many shows did you do in Zurich now?

[<a id="00-03-46">00:03:46</a>]  So far in Switzerland, actually, um, in this, this week now, then you've been here with,

[<a id="00-03-51">00:03:51</a>]  with us four or five, five or six, I think five or six.

[<a id="00-03-55">00:03:55</a>]  One of them really wasn't like a standup show though.

[<a id="00-03-57">00:03:57</a>]  That Tuesday show.

[<a id="00-03-58">00:03:58</a>]  All right.

[<a id="00-03-59">00:03:59</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-04-00">00:04:00</a>]  But do you want to, do you want to go into this, do you want to talk about your experience

[<a id="00-04-03">00:04:03</a>]  here?

[<a id="00-04-04">00:04:04</a>]  Um, you know, after talk to Ben, I remember why I was like a little, uh, embarrassed.

[<a id="00-04-11">00:04:11</a>]  I finally realized that I guess the show wasn't that bad.

[<a id="00-04-15">00:04:15</a>]  I mean, I wasn't that great, but, um, it's not, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

[<a id="00-04-19">00:04:19</a>]  I feel like I misled him.

[<a id="00-04-20">00:04:20</a>]  I remember when I saw him finally, cause he saw me in Santa Monica, youth hostel, open

[<a id="00-04-26">00:04:26</a>]  mic.

[<a id="00-04-27">00:04:27</a>]  I don't know if for whatever reason, one of those rare nights I did clean set, Ben was

[<a id="00-04-31">00:04:31</a>]  really impressed.

[<a id="00-04-32">00:04:32</a>]  So he's like, when he invited me, he thought I'm going to do that, which I never do.

[<a id="00-04-37">00:04:37</a>]  Why did you do it that night though?

[<a id="00-04-39">00:04:39</a>]  I don't remember.

[<a id="00-04-40">00:04:40</a>]  I was supposed to do something with my friend, whoever was canceled, I didn't have anything

[<a id="00-04-45">00:04:45</a>]  to do.

[<a id="00-04-46">00:04:46</a>]  So I drove all the way to Santa Monica and my friend Andy runs it, but Andy wasn't there.

[<a id="00-04-52">00:04:52</a>]  My guy named Michael manager was running it.

[<a id="00-04-55">00:04:55</a>]  So I went up and he did a show afterwards.

[<a id="00-04-58">00:04:58</a>]  I like what he did and I like people from Europe and then he liked what I did.

[<a id="00-05-04">00:05:04</a>]  He just said, Hey, if you ever come to Switzerland, we'd love to have you stand down.

[<a id="00-05-07">00:05:07</a>]  So this is, this is our friend Ben Delahaye that saw you in LA and then got you over and

[<a id="00-05-16">00:05:16</a>]  I want to say 2022.

[<a id="00-05-18">00:05:18</a>]  That sounds right.

[<a id="00-05-20">00:05:20</a>]  Um, he got you over to do a gig.

[<a id="00-05-23">00:05:23</a>]  And I think I did good.

[<a id="00-05-25">00:05:25</a>]  Maybe one.

[<a id="00-05-26">00:05:26</a>]  Out of the three.

[<a id="00-05-29">00:05:29</a>]  Because you saw me in Memphis, right?

[<a id="00-05-30">00:05:30</a>]  Like if I want, if I know my audience, I know how to get those people riled up.

[<a id="00-05-35">00:05:35</a>]  I have no sense of that over here, you know, but also just to add in the short time you've

[<a id="00-05-42">00:05:42</a>]  been here, you mentioned this experience in 2022 at least 10 times.

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-05-48">00:05:48</a>]  It was traumatic.

[<a id="00-05-49">00:05:49</a>]  I don't, I don't, it's not a traumatic, like a capital T, but like, it just feels like an

[<a id="00-05-57">00:05:57</a>]  American attitude.

[<a id="00-05-58">00:05:58</a>]  Go abroad and bomb the place.

[<a id="00-06-00">00:06:00</a>]  It feels like I got caught shoplifting and I'm going back to that store and start working

[<a id="00-06-09">00:06:09</a>]  there.

[<a id="00-06-10">00:06:10</a>]  Does that make sense?

[<a id="00-06-11">00:06:11</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-06-12">00:06:12</a>]  It's a little awkward, like, hi, I'm not one of the staff members, but believe me, there's

[<a id="00-06-22">00:06:22</a>]  times I had really amazing shows, um, but those are never really memorable.

[<a id="00-06-30">00:06:30</a>]  It's the disaster one that you always think about, you know, um, like you're not interesting

[<a id="00-06-36">00:06:36</a>]  girls that want you.

[<a id="00-06-37">00:06:37</a>]  You're interested girls that don't want you, you know?

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-06-41">00:06:41</a>]  Um, this is Switzerland for you is the, the gig, the girlfriend that you could never had

[<a id="00-06-46">00:06:46</a>]  so far.

[<a id="00-06-47">00:06:47</a>]  The one that got away.

[<a id="00-06-48">00:06:48</a>]  Well, this place has so many things I'm just mystified by, you know, uh, I mean about money

[<a id="00-06-53">00:06:53</a>]  for sure.

[<a id="00-06-54">00:06:54</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-06-55">00:06:55</a>]  And how much impact it has the rest of the world, but, um, it made me laugh.

[<a id="00-07-04">00:07:04</a>]  It made me laugh because when I, what was the, um, the fancy hotel that went, something

[<a id="00-07-09">00:07:09</a>]  grand.

[<a id="00-07-10">00:07:10</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-07-11">00:07:11</a>]  Cause I love that movie, uh, girl with the dragon tattoo, you know, actually my favorite

[<a id="00-07-15">00:07:15</a>]  parts like last seven minutes when she's able to, if you saw the movie, um, disguise, go

[<a id="00-07-21">00:07:21</a>]  to Switzerland disguise and steal the renegade oligarch money out of Switzerland, you know,

[<a id="00-07-30">00:07:30</a>]  but the whole process seemed like that to me, that was my favorite part of the whole

[<a id="00-07-33">00:07:33</a>]  movie because I mean, money, whether you like it or not, it's such a big thing.

[<a id="00-07-40">00:07:40</a>]  And growing up, even Patrice says that all the time, he doesn't understand money and

[<a id="00-07-44">00:07:44</a>]  how money work.

[<a id="00-07-46">00:07:46</a>]  And I think money cause problem when you have too much of it.

[<a id="00-07-52">00:07:52</a>]  Money cause problem when you don't have any of it and things that people do, do for it,

[<a id="00-07-57">00:07:57</a>]  you know?

[<a id="00-07-58">00:07:58</a>]  And I think there is a connection with money and sex, you know?

[<a id="00-08-03">00:08:03</a>]  I think that's why I ended up working for my boss, John Steliano, because he went to

[<a id="00-08-08">00:08:08</a>]  UCLA.

[<a id="00-08-09">00:08:09</a>]  He was, um, I don't know what was he studying originally, but he ended up studying economics

[<a id="00-08-15">00:08:15</a>]  and dance, you know, and he's one of the few people in the world who does really, did my

[<a id="00-08-24">00:08:24</a>]  introduction to the world where the intersection of money and sex and, and, and I thought if

[<a id="00-08-33">00:08:33</a>]  you understand that, you could probably understand why some things wonderful happened and why

[<a id="00-08-38">00:08:38</a>]  so many miserable things happened, you know?

[<a id="00-08-40">00:08:40</a>]  Do you see that, um, very much like, the reason why you were saying this also about Switzerland,

[<a id="00-08-47">00:08:47</a>]  this is something that you see here as more prevalent?

[<a id="00-08-52">00:08:52</a>]  I mean, I mean the fact that most of the high paying jobs like IT and banking, they already

[<a id="00-08-59">00:08:59</a>]  tell me, already piqued my interest, you know?

[<a id="00-09-05">00:09:05</a>]  And growing up poor and not understanding money, these places are good as any.

[<a id="00-09-10">00:09:10</a>]  But when I went to Davos last year, and luckily I was, we were, happy accident, you just happened

[<a id="00-09-15">00:09:15</a>]  to be in Dinah when I was there, it's just a mystifying place.

[<a id="00-09-19">00:09:19</a>]  I, I, what I don't like is I just hate seeing people in miserable situations, you know?

[<a id="00-09-26">00:09:26</a>]  But it's because lack of opportunity, lack of understanding economics, lack of understanding

[<a id="00-09-30">00:09:30</a>]  money, that's that.

[<a id="00-09-33">00:09:33</a>]  And how do you understand this rich and powerful people?

[<a id="00-09-35">00:09:35</a>]  I use this key called sex, you know, because that is the only time they will ever talk

[<a id="00-09-40">00:09:40</a>]  to me.

[<a id="00-09-41">00:09:41</a>]  There's a, there's a nice quote I heard this week, it just said, uh, and think through

[<a id="00-09-47">00:09:47</a>]  the impacts of what would happen if all women on the planet suddenly disappeared.

[<a id="00-09-51">00:09:51</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-09-52">00:09:52</a>]  And if all the financial markets would just crash immediately, the motivation would just

[<a id="00-09-57">00:09:57</a>]  die with them.

[<a id="00-09-58">00:09:58</a>]  Exactly.

[<a id="00-09-59">00:09:59</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-00">00:10:00</a>]  It's like, um, a sexist version of the end times in the Bible.

[<a id="00-10-06">00:10:06</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-07">00:10:07</a>]  You know that, you know the thing, tell me a little bit, okay, so, um, there, there's

[<a id="00-10-14">00:10:14</a>]  a concept that a lot of evangelicals believe in, like Mike Pompeo, for example, um, that

[<a id="00-10-21">00:10:21</a>]  there will be a vanishing of the believers in, uh, before the end times start.

[<a id="00-10-27">00:10:27</a>]  So all the, all the Christians will just be gone one day.

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-33">00:10:33</a>]  There are some movies that were made about it.

[<a id="00-10-35">00:10:35</a>]  There's a, there's a horrible book series, like Leftovers is one, um, there, one of my

[<a id="00-10-41">00:10:41</a>]  favorite shows about that.

[<a id="00-10-43">00:10:43</a>]  There's, what was that guy called, that, that actor, um, that played Hercules for a long

[<a id="00-10-49">00:10:49</a>]  time on these, uh, shitty TV shows.

[<a id="00-10-52">00:10:52</a>]  Hercules.

[<a id="00-10-53">00:10:53</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-54">00:10:54</a>]  It was a, it was like a B movie Hercules.

[<a id="00-10-58">00:10:58</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-10-59">00:10:59</a>]  And he, he, uh, was he a former bodybuilder?

[<a id="00-11-02">00:11:02</a>]  No, no, he wasn't actually, um, I'm trying to find his name.

[<a id="00-11-07">00:11:07</a>]  Kevin Sorbo.

[<a id="00-11-08">00:11:08</a>]  Oh yes.

[<a id="00-11-09">00:11:09</a>]  He's conservative.

[<a id="00-11-10">00:11:10</a>]  He's extremely conservative and extremely Christian.

[<a id="00-11-13">00:11:13</a>]  And, um, he also did, uh, a TV movie.

[<a id="00-11-18">00:11:18</a>]  There's a whole, there's a whole book series written by two American authors about how

[<a id="00-11-25">00:11:25</a>]  the end times would unravel.

[<a id="00-11-26">00:11:26</a>]  So they basically looked at revelations and then transposed it into American society.

[<a id="00-11-33">00:11:33</a>]  So like take 1990 and now the end times are here.

[<a id="00-11-37">00:11:37</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-11-38">00:11:38</a>]  So, and they go through the whole spiel and Kevin Sorbo was the lead actor in one of those.

[<a id="00-11-44">00:11:44</a>]  Um, and basically his wife is a believer and disappears one day and he, he is a pilot.

[<a id="00-11-52">00:11:52</a>]  So, and then he starts believing, um, during that time, that's basically what the, what

[<a id="00-11-57">00:11:57</a>]  the story is.

[<a id="00-11-58">00:11:58</a>]  Wow.

[<a id="00-11-59">00:11:59</a>]  I didn't, so I guess O.J.

[<a id="00-12-00">00:12:00</a>]  Simpson was a believer.

[<a id="00-12-01">00:12:01</a>]  He made his wife disappear.

[<a id="00-12-02">00:12:02</a>]  I didn't know that.

[<a id="00-12-03">00:12:03</a>]  But you know what's funny?

[<a id="00-12-04">00:12:04</a>]  Fucking times.

[<a id="00-12-05">00:12:05</a>]  By the way, I met O.J. in 88.

[<a id="00-12-06">00:12:06</a>]  Did you, did you shake his hand with the glove or without the glove?

[<a id="00-12-13">00:12:13</a>]  His hands are so massive.

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  I just can't.

[<a id="00-12-18">00:12:18</a>]  I mean Brett Farr and guy like him and Mike Tyson and these like athletes, you just cannot

[<a id="00-12-24">00:12:24</a>]  believe.

[<a id="00-12-25">00:12:25</a>]  I can't, I'm so embarrassed to stand next to them and I'm not a man.

[<a id="00-12-29">00:12:29</a>]  I'm Yoshi.

[<a id="00-12-30">00:12:30</a>]  How much did he pay you to do it?

[<a id="00-12-34">00:12:34</a>]  Like, so, okay, but let's, let's go back to, um, to your Zerg experience because I'm really

[<a id="00-12-41">00:12:41</a>]  intrigued.

[<a id="00-12-42">00:12:42</a>]  Like, you've done different types of shows right now, like different to what you've done

[<a id="00-12-47">00:12:47</a>]  last time you came over with, with Ben.

[<a id="00-12-49">00:12:49</a>]  I mean, two nights ago when I did, when I did those two shows, I did regularly what,

[<a id="00-12-54">00:12:54</a>]  what many of my comedians go, Yoshi jokes, it went so well.

[<a id="00-12-58">00:12:58</a>]  Even the second one, I think whenever you warn me, like this might be a little lukewarm.

[<a id="00-13-02">00:13:02</a>]  It went even better than the first one.

[<a id="00-13-03">00:13:03</a>]  You fucking murdered that man.

[<a id="00-13-05">00:13:05</a>]  So I think, um, it can work, you know, but not last night.

[<a id="00-13-11">00:13:11</a>]  I'm a little overboard last 15 minutes, compared to how, how much they were loving it versus

[<a id="00-13-19">00:13:19</a>]  how it ended.

[<a id="00-13-20">00:13:20</a>]  You know what?

[<a id="00-13-21">00:13:21</a>]  You know that feeling in a room when it suddenly goes cold?

[<a id="00-13-25">00:13:25</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-13-26">00:13:26</a>]  And then you're talking to me, that's how I do comedy most times.

[<a id="00-13-31">00:13:31</a>]  And it was good.

[<a id="00-13-32">00:13:32</a>]  And then Yoshi said, and I was having like physical, I was, my body was, I was standing

[<a id="00-13-39">00:13:39</a>]  a lot with you, but I didn't know there was a mother and some combo front.

[<a id="00-13-44">00:13:44</a>]  And it shouldn't matter though.

[<a id="00-13-47">00:13:47</a>]  Like anyway, and it was like this six or salt joke three times in a row, but you know, I

[<a id="00-13-52">00:13:52</a>]  know what's beautiful about that is, is you miss that at the beginning of the show, right?

[<a id="00-13-56">00:13:56</a>]  I didn't cry a word with them and she, she really explained like, we don't spend enough

[<a id="00-14-01">00:14:01</a>]  time together.

[<a id="00-14-02">00:14:02</a>]  He's always gaming.

[<a id="00-14-03">00:14:03</a>]  I've been traveling a lot, so we're here because, so by bonding, you want to hear rape jokes.

[<a id="00-14-08">00:14:08</a>]  So you think they're both traumatized at the same time.

[<a id="00-14-11">00:14:11</a>]  I joked about that.

[<a id="00-14-12">00:14:12</a>]  I said, you're going to have a traumatic experience.

[<a id="00-14-14">00:14:14</a>]  It's going to bring you together and you deliver, they're going to have the best Christmas ever.

[<a id="00-14-20">00:14:20</a>]  I think sometimes I forget, as long as you tell people you have a good intention and

[<a id="00-14-26">00:14:26</a>]  why you're doing it, um, sometimes you don't have to do the American audience cause they

[<a id="00-14-31">00:14:31</a>]  have, they've heard comedy for a long time.

[<a id="00-14-33">00:14:33</a>]  They've heard enough.

[<a id="00-14-34">00:14:34</a>]  They kind of infer or they understand, you know, and, um, I mean, at least for myself,

[<a id="00-14-42">00:14:42</a>]  I can only speak for myself, but, um, I say stuff like that because sometimes things like

[<a id="00-14-48">00:14:48</a>]  that happen in the real world.

[<a id="00-14-50">00:14:50</a>]  People are not capable of talking about it.

[<a id="00-14-52">00:14:52</a>]  And if you can't talk about it, you can't really deal with the problems, you know, and

[<a id="00-14-55">00:14:55</a>]  I think if you could laugh at it and, uh, um, you can have that conversation.

[<a id="00-15-00">00:15:00</a>]  But I think I did a poor job of that because, um, I was a little too relaxed because I had

[<a id="00-15-06">00:15:06</a>]  a glow from the night before two shows, but Tuesday I think, I think things went all right

[<a id="00-15-11">00:15:11</a>]  because I, for whatever reason, that was the first time in Europe, I just couldn't stay

[<a id="00-15-16">00:15:16</a>]  up during the middle of the day because I was planning to spend like five, six hours

[<a id="00-15-20">00:15:20</a>]  just write down, get ready.

[<a id="00-15-22">00:15:22</a>]  And I just, I was so sleep.

[<a id="00-15-23">00:15:23</a>]  I couldn't get up.

[<a id="00-15-24">00:15:24</a>]  Then the funny thing, I got up like, holy fuck, I got to be there in like 40 minutes

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  and I didn't even have time to prepare.

[<a id="00-15-30">00:15:30</a>]  You know what it is, sometime overthinking, over-preparing will fuck you up.

[<a id="00-15-35">00:15:35</a>]  I just went up like, I guess, you know, if they didn't like it, I've been here and bombed

[<a id="00-15-39">00:15:39</a>]  before.

[<a id="00-15-40">00:15:40</a>]  So, you know, but I'm always shocked, like, on those nights like that, things go all right

[<a id="00-15-45">00:15:45</a>]  according to you guys.

[<a id="00-15-46">00:15:46</a>]  I don't know what to make of it.

[<a id="00-15-47">00:15:47</a>]  And of course, another nights when I'm a little too confident, I have a disaster of like 17,

[<a id="00-15-53">00:15:53</a>]  14 minutes.

[<a id="00-15-54">00:15:54</a>]  - I'm so glad that you're saying this because I thought that's an affliction that you have

[<a id="00-15-58">00:15:58</a>]  when you're not that versed in comedy, but coming from you, and how long have you been

[<a id="00-16-03">00:16:03</a>]  doing comedy?

[<a id="00-16-04">00:16:04</a>]  Like 15?

[<a id="00-16-05">00:16:05</a>]  - 90s.

[<a id="00-16-06">00:16:06</a>]  - Since the 90s?

[<a id="00-16-07">00:16:07</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-08">00:16:08</a>]  - So more than 20 years?

[<a id="00-16-09">00:16:09</a>]  - Yeah, of course.

[<a id="00-16-10">00:16:10</a>]  - Okay.

[<a id="00-16-11">00:16:11</a>]  - Off and on.

[<a id="00-16-12">00:16:12</a>]  - So, but if this is coming from you, that gives me hope, it's like in this selfish way.

[<a id="00-16-17">00:16:17</a>]  - I think, I don't think you should be too confident, you know?

[<a id="00-16-21">00:16:21</a>]  - No.

[<a id="00-16-22">00:16:22</a>]  - I mean, I mean, the thing is we have the, I think one thing is we have a false impression

[<a id="00-16-26">00:16:26</a>]  because you get the, you get to watch specials from top comedians performing to their fans.

[<a id="00-16-32">00:16:32</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-33">00:16:33</a>]  - And when you have, when you have a home crowd, it's always way easier.

[<a id="00-16-37">00:16:37</a>]  - They laugh no matter what you say.

[<a id="00-16-39">00:16:39</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-40">00:16:40</a>]  - Especially if you're bigger the star that you are, they just laugh anyway.

[<a id="00-16-43">00:16:43</a>]  - Sorry to get there, because you're right, but then you have like specials that, like

[<a id="00-16-50">00:16:50</a>]  the specials from Colin Quinn recently, where he's just filming a set, a corporate gig.

[<a id="00-16-58">00:16:58</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-16-59">00:16:59</a>]  - He literally filmed the corporate gig as a special, not his fans.

[<a id="00-17-02">00:17:02</a>]  - No.

[<a id="00-17-03">00:17:03</a>]  - These are people that go, is it from psychologists?

[<a id="00-17-06">00:17:06</a>]  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-17-07">00:17:07</a>]  - And these are people that go to this thing to meet other psychologists and then comedy

[<a id="00-17-13">00:17:13</a>]  happens.

[<a id="00-17-14">00:17:14</a>]  So it couldn't be worse in terms of comedy, like the deck is already against you and he

[<a id="00-17-20">00:17:20</a>]  fucking nags you.

[<a id="00-17-21">00:17:21</a>]  - Yeah, but he had great material.

[<a id="00-17-23">00:17:23</a>]  - Do you guys ever watch the movie Gangs of New York?

[<a id="00-17-26">00:17:26</a>]  - Sure, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-17-27">00:17:27</a>]  - Remember that guy, Daniel Day-Lewis played?

[<a id="00-17-31">00:17:31</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-17-32">00:17:32</a>]  - The knife-wielding cutthroat?

[<a id="00-17-35">00:17:35</a>]  - The butcher.

[<a id="00-17-36">00:17:36</a>]  - Yeah, and I don't know about comedy cellar these days, because I'm not so sure what to

[<a id="00-17-43">00:17:43</a>]  make of it.

[<a id="00-17-44">00:17:44</a>]  But as far as like early 2000, when you go down there, man, that corner in the, when

[<a id="00-17-53">00:17:53</a>]  Robert Kelly told me, one of the guys told me to sit in the corner with the comedians,

[<a id="00-17-57">00:17:57</a>]  when Robert Kelly sat down, he put the little message thing, plastic thing, flip it, look,

[<a id="00-18-03">00:18:03</a>]  and it just said only comedians, so he said get the fuck out of here, so I had to get

[<a id="00-18-07">00:18:07</a>]  up and leave.

[<a id="00-18-08">00:18:08</a>]  He said, I'm fucking with you, I sit down, can't you read, motherfucker, like, you know.

[<a id="00-18-12">00:18:12</a>]  But you gotta remember when I used to go there, early 2000, I mean, I was there like 2001,

[<a id="00-18-16">00:18:16</a>]  right, I was there like within a week to 10 days of 9/11, that was my first trip in New

[<a id="00-18-21">00:18:21</a>]  York.

[<a id="00-18-22">00:18:22</a>]  There's like fucking David Hale, Colin Quinn, Louis, Patrice, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-18-30">00:18:30</a>]  You just watch what you say, 'cause you slip and say something stupid, they're gonna use

[<a id="00-18-33">00:18:33</a>]  it.

[<a id="00-18-34">00:18:34</a>]  - Oh, they're gonna go after you.

[<a id="00-18-35">00:18:35</a>]  - Yeah, it's like this dolphin sees like the unwanted baby, they're just kind of tortured

[<a id="00-18-42">00:18:42</a>]  into it before.

[<a id="00-18-43">00:18:43</a>]  They could kill it right now, but they have to fuck with it, you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-18-47">00:18:47</a>]  Or the cat playing with the mice, like, just give them a little bit of hope like they could

[<a id="00-18-52">00:18:52</a>]  escape, but no, they're gonna kill you, but I remember seeing that, because just like

[<a id="00-18-57">00:18:57</a>]  American football, even if you're not the quarterback, if you sit on the bench and watch,

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  you really learn a lot, you know.

[<a id="00-19-03">00:19:03</a>]  - So, but watching--

[<a id="00-19-04">00:19:04</a>]  - That's the only advantage I have over you guys, I think, and time.

[<a id="00-19-09">00:19:09</a>]  - When you then look at the comedy scene like this one, which is more like, it feels like

[<a id="00-19-15">00:19:15</a>]  a surrogate, somehow, like--

[<a id="00-19-17">00:19:17</a>]  - It's improved a lot, I think, within like two years, because I think even the audience

[<a id="00-19-22">00:19:22</a>]  are open to edgy stuff, you know?

[<a id="00-19-26">00:19:26</a>]  'Cause I think two years ago, when I did some of the rooms, because they're rich people,

[<a id="00-19-29">00:19:29</a>]  they just thought I was trying to be mean, and because the Hitler was such a good looking,

[<a id="00-19-35">00:19:35</a>]  smart, clever, and sweet guy, that the mean and sweet, the gap was so big, you know, except

[<a id="00-19-41">00:19:41</a>]  there's a, I mean, it's that big show that we did, there was like four or five old Swiss

[<a id="00-19-45">00:19:45</a>]  that loved it, they just, 'cause they were with their miserable wives, and they were hating

[<a id="00-19-50">00:19:50</a>]  me, so they loved the fact I made them miserable, so they loved that.

[<a id="00-19-55">00:19:55</a>]  (laughs)

[<a id="00-19-56">00:19:56</a>]  - But what--

[<a id="00-19-58">00:19:58</a>]  - They're full Harrys, that's what they were, any miserable pricks, I'm gonna call them Harrys.

[<a id="00-20-05">00:20:05</a>]  (laughs)

[<a id="00-20-06">00:20:06</a>]  - Go ahead.

[<a id="00-20-07">00:20:07</a>]  (laughs)

[<a id="00-20-08">00:20:08</a>]  - I was gonna ask a general question--

[<a id="00-20-09">00:20:09</a>]  - I mean, just be fair, every time I tell you I'm going to Kiev, you always think, when

[<a id="00-20-14">00:20:14</a>]  I'm there, I'm gonna get nuked.

[<a id="00-20-15">00:20:15</a>]  You--

[<a id="00-20-16">00:20:16</a>]  - It's a genuine possibility, dude.

[<a id="00-20-17">00:20:17</a>]  - Yeah, I know, but it makes you so happy--

[<a id="00-20-18">00:20:18</a>]  - No, it's two things.

[<a id="00-20-19">00:20:19</a>]  One is I think you should think twice about what you're doing.

[<a id="00-20-20">00:20:20</a>]  And the other thing is, if you do get blown up in a nuke, I'm gonna--

[<a id="00-20-32">00:20:32</a>]  - You have a nice footage.

[<a id="00-20-33">00:20:33</a>]  - Exactly, we're gonna be, because the thing is, the thing is the way my brain works, I'm

[<a id="00-20-38">00:20:38</a>]  one of the few people that actually can think ahead on the planet, most people are just

[<a id="00-20-43">00:20:43</a>]  living--

[<a id="00-20-44">00:20:44</a>]  - Every possible horrible things that could happen.

[<a id="00-20-45">00:20:45</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-20-46">00:20:46</a>]  - No, it's not every--

[<a id="00-20-47">00:20:47</a>]  - You're that black piece in a chess board.

[<a id="00-20-48">00:20:48</a>]  (laughs)

[<a id="00-20-50">00:20:50</a>]  - Christian is the nice whiteboard.

[<a id="00-20-54">00:20:54</a>]  You only move black, you only move black, he moves white.

[<a id="00-20-59">00:20:59</a>]  - I mean, what's the best possible thing that could happen to you in Ukraine?

[<a id="00-21-03">00:21:03</a>]  It's cold and miserable.

[<a id="00-21-04">00:21:04</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-21-05">00:21:05</a>]  - That's the best possible outcome.

[<a id="00-21-06">00:21:06</a>]  - It's cold and miserable here too.

[<a id="00-21-08">00:21:08</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-21-09">00:21:09</a>]  - But you have money.

[<a id="00-21-10">00:21:10</a>]  That's the only difference.

[<a id="00-21-11">00:21:11</a>]  - Exactly.

[<a id="00-21-12">00:21:12</a>]  That does not make you happy though.

[<a id="00-21-13">00:21:13</a>]  All right, so here's a question.

[<a id="00-21-17">00:21:17</a>]  Based on the few shows you've done this week, what are you seeing from Swiss audiences?

[<a id="00-21-24">00:21:24</a>]  What are some things that stand out?

[<a id="00-21-28">00:21:28</a>]  - It's not as monolithic as I thought it was.

[<a id="00-21-31">00:21:31</a>]  And you actually have a diverse audience.

[<a id="00-21-34">00:21:34</a>]  'Cause especially that two nights ago, that second show, dude, there was a couple guys

[<a id="00-21-38">00:21:38</a>]  laughing like Americans.

[<a id="00-21-40">00:21:40</a>]  Like they didn't give a fuck, everybody was uncomfortable, I love that.

[<a id="00-21-44">00:21:44</a>]  I like, I don't like throwing this like a softball set of punchline jokes where audience

[<a id="00-21-52">00:21:52</a>]  are like, okay, he's doing his best, we'll give him something, like a little bit of a

[<a id="00-21-56">00:21:56</a>]  ha ha, whatever.

[<a id="00-21-58">00:21:58</a>]  But there's a couple guys in that second show, even though there was such terrible things

[<a id="00-22-02">00:22:02</a>]  I was saying, they loved it.

[<a id="00-22-04">00:22:04</a>]  And especially the one with their boyfriend or wife, they didn't give a fuck, they didn't

[<a id="00-22-10">00:22:10</a>]  like it.

[<a id="00-22-11">00:22:11</a>]  And that I like, I like making people that don't want to laugh, laugh.

[<a id="00-22-15">00:22:15</a>]  'Cause they have to confront with the idea that the things I say, there's still some

[<a id="00-22-20">00:22:20</a>]  kind of like a dark, ugly logic to it, 'cause it's not completely absurd, because some of

[<a id="00-22-26">00:22:26</a>]  the stuff does have like a really weird logic to it, you know?

[<a id="00-22-29">00:22:29</a>]  And they don't want to think about that, they don't want to think that possibility that

[<a id="00-22-35">00:22:35</a>]  you could laugh at something miserable happen.

[<a id="00-22-37">00:22:37</a>]  Well, my intention is, don't live a life pretending like that shit is not happening, and when

[<a id="00-22-41">00:22:41</a>]  you choose not to do something, you're part of the problem, so I'm reminding you some

[<a id="00-22-46">00:22:46</a>]  of the horrible shit.

[<a id="00-22-47">00:22:47</a>]  Then you make a decision, whether laugh, then maybe you could do something about it.

[<a id="00-22-52">00:22:52</a>]  - I love the fact that your friends call it Yoshi jokes.

[<a id="00-22-54">00:22:54</a>]  - No, no, but they do, it's like, because sometimes they're like, Yoshi, I cannot do

[<a id="00-22-57">00:22:57</a>]  this joke, 'cause I can't, but I know you could.

[<a id="00-22-59">00:22:59</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-23-00">00:23:00</a>]  You know when you have a retarded kid in a class, you don't want to do it, so then you

[<a id="00-23-04">00:23:04</a>]  tell him to go up and pull that teacher's panty down.

[<a id="00-23-08">00:23:08</a>]  Okay, so I was that retarded, but no, I've always been like that.

[<a id="00-23-12">00:23:12</a>]  That's why I used to get beat up all the time, every day in school, 'cause they'd say, "Hey,

[<a id="00-23-16">00:23:16</a>]  why don't you do that?"

[<a id="00-23-17">00:23:17</a>]  "Okay, then I'll go do it."

[<a id="00-23-18">00:23:18</a>]  - Yeah, now I know why you, because I was the guy that would get the kid to do the dumb

[<a id="00-23-22">00:23:22</a>]  shit.

[<a id="00-23-23">00:23:23</a>]  - Yeah, I'm the dumb shit.

[<a id="00-23-24">00:23:24</a>]  - I couldn't, all right, then I was the silent observer, like Switzerland, and that's why

[<a id="00-23-29">00:23:29</a>]  we've organized quite a few shows for Yoshi in Switzerland.

[<a id="00-23-32">00:23:32</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-23-33">00:23:33</a>]  - You guys really are the good cop, bad cop.

[<a id="00-23-36">00:23:36</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-23-37">00:23:37</a>]  - Harry would actually disagree on this one.

[<a id="00-23-44">00:23:44</a>]  He still believes that I'm evil.

[<a id="00-23-45">00:23:45</a>]  - He is, this man is evil, but the difference is that--

[<a id="00-23-49">00:23:49</a>]  - But he's classy about it.

[<a id="00-23-51">00:23:51</a>]  - That's the worst kind of evil.

[<a id="00-23-53">00:23:53</a>]  That's the evil where they sell you a night's night in a hotel while they blow up your country.

[<a id="00-23-59">00:23:59</a>]  - When you were talking to those two 20-year-old girls, I was shaking my fist, motherfucker.

[<a id="00-24-03">00:24:03</a>]  It wasn't like a jealousy, like, why are you trying to ruin their innocence and any possibility

[<a id="00-24-09">00:24:09</a>]  of happiness?

[<a id="00-24-10">00:24:10</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-24-11">00:24:11</a>]  Why would you do that?

[<a id="00-24-12">00:24:12</a>]  - How many whiskeys did you have at that point?

[<a id="00-24-15">00:24:15</a>]  - That was like four in.

[<a id="00-24-16">00:24:16</a>]  - All right.

[<a id="00-24-17">00:24:17</a>]  - But the thing is--

[<a id="00-24-18">00:24:18</a>]  - Don't get me wrong, it's fun to talk to young, pretty girls, sure, but at some point

[<a id="00-24-26">00:24:26</a>]  I have to stop playing video games.

[<a id="00-24-28">00:24:28</a>]  At some point.

[<a id="00-24-29">00:24:29</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-24-30">00:24:30</a>]  Stop watching porn.

[<a id="00-24-31">00:24:31</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-24-32">00:24:32</a>]  You know what I mean?

[<a id="00-24-33">00:24:33</a>]  At some point, at some point you have to choose something dignified.

[<a id="00-24-39">00:24:39</a>]  You're so undignified in so many different ways.

[<a id="00-24-42">00:24:42</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-24-43">00:24:43</a>]  I mean, I'm undignified too, but when you hang out with guys like Colin Quinn, man,

[<a id="00-24-51">00:24:51</a>]  they just put that dagger in you, you know?

[<a id="00-24-54">00:24:54</a>]  That's why I'm always careful what I say because, man, I don't want to tell you what I said

[<a id="00-24-58">00:24:58</a>]  but last time I was hanging out with, open for a tale in Mothership, there's a couple

[<a id="00-25-04">00:25:04</a>]  of times he said like, because there's things about me I don't want to talk about and hide

[<a id="00-25-08">00:25:08</a>]  it, man, that guy just see through it, man, and he'll just kind of say it, man, it's,

[<a id="00-25-14">00:25:14</a>]  I'd rather him punch me in the face because it's really hard one to take and I keep, fuck,

[<a id="00-25-20">00:25:20</a>]  he really knows me and he just, you know, I'm trying to hide it.

[<a id="00-25-24">00:25:24</a>]  - What did he go after?

[<a id="00-25-25">00:25:25</a>]  - What?

[<a id="00-25-26">00:25:26</a>]  - What did he go after?

[<a id="00-25-27">00:25:27</a>]  - He didn't even go after but he, you know, like, he would just say it, you know, it's

[<a id="00-25-32">00:25:32</a>]  kind of funny but like, he sees it, you know?

[<a id="00-25-34">00:25:34</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-35">00:25:35</a>]  But that's a unique thing, there's one thing is empathy but, I mean, 'cause you talk with

[<a id="00-25-41">00:25:41</a>]  Chris Dower a little bit yesterday, the Australian.

[<a id="00-25-44">00:25:44</a>]  - Great friend of the show.

[<a id="00-25-45">00:25:45</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-25-46">00:25:46</a>]  - Big star, right?

[<a id="00-25-47">00:25:47</a>]  - Uh.

[<a id="00-25-48">00:25:48</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-25-49">00:25:49</a>]  - Well, why are you laughing?

[<a id="00-25-50">00:25:50</a>]  (laughing)

[<a id="00-25-51">00:25:51</a>]  I'm not being sarcastic, I thought he was a big star or something, you know?

[<a id="00-25-56">00:25:56</a>]  - Up and coming.

[<a id="00-25-58">00:25:58</a>]  - A little bit like gay porn.

[<a id="00-25-59">00:25:59</a>]  - You just roasted him and everything.

[<a id="00-26-01">00:26:01</a>]  - I didn't!

[<a id="00-26-02">00:26:02</a>]  - In one sentence.

[<a id="00-26-03">00:26:03</a>]  Without even knowing.

[<a id="00-26-04">00:26:04</a>]  - Oh my god.

[<a id="00-26-05">00:26:05</a>]  - No, but--

[<a id="00-26-06">00:26:06</a>]  - I don't want to talk shit about the comedians.

[<a id="00-26-09">00:26:09</a>]  - No, no, no, no, no.

[<a id="00-26-10">00:26:10</a>]  - I have no reason.

[<a id="00-26-11">00:26:11</a>]  - It's all good.

[<a id="00-26-12">00:26:12</a>]  - Believe me, there's plenty of them I fucking hate but it doesn't do me any good, you know?

[<a id="00-26-18">00:26:18</a>]  - No.

[<a id="00-26-19">00:26:19</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-26-20">00:26:20</a>]  - No, Chris is an amazing comedian, he's, hands down, he's one of the best comedians

[<a id="00-26-22">00:26:22</a>]  in Switzerland right now.

[<a id="00-26-23">00:26:23</a>]  - Yeah, he's got that same, it's kind of the same thing, the speed at which he can find

[<a id="00-26-28">00:26:28</a>]  people's insecurities is unbelievable, and most of the time--

[<a id="00-26-33">00:26:33</a>]  - Nothing against him, nothing against him, but when you go to America and do some of

[<a id="00-26-39">00:26:39</a>]  the bigger rooms and when you work with those big names, it's a rude awakening because as

[<a id="00-26-43">00:26:43</a>]  good as he might be, it's like 20 years ago when the Europeans were playing basketball

[<a id="00-26-49">00:26:49</a>]  with the best of the best American basketball player, it is a dreadful realization, as good

[<a id="00-26-55">00:26:55</a>]  as they are, and they are very good, those motherfuckers that came here in '92, you know?

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  - I'm glad you're taking that as a reference point because right now some of the best NBA

[<a id="00-27-06">00:27:06</a>]  players are full-fledged Europeans.

[<a id="00-27-09">00:27:09</a>]  - Sure, but the stand-up comedians are not at that level, believe me.

[<a id="00-27-13">00:27:13</a>]  - We're still playing EuroLeague here, for sure.

[<a id="00-27-17">00:27:17</a>]  - That's what I'm just saying, because I remember doing some of those big shows, you just can't

[<a id="00-27-23">00:27:23</a>]  believe how good they are, you know?

[<a id="00-27-26">00:27:26</a>]  You know their group, seen on YouTube and things, but when you see them working on new

[<a id="00-27-31">00:27:31</a>]  material and they make adjustments, like, "Fuuuck!"

[<a id="00-27-35">00:27:35</a>]  - Yeah, I remember seeing Louie Spin in Basel a couple of times.

[<a id="00-27-41">00:27:41</a>]  - And my friend Robert Kelly opened for me, he was telling about it a couple of days,

[<a id="00-27-43">00:27:43</a>]  I forgot that he opened for me, you know, so I know enough people like, "Hey, what was

[<a id="00-27-47">00:27:47</a>]  it like?"

[<a id="00-27-48">00:27:48</a>]  You know, so I have an inside baseball shirt.

[<a id="00-27-50">00:27:50</a>]  - But there's something about Louie that really stands out to this day, the room he's staying

[<a id="00-27-55">00:27:55</a>]  in is about a thousand people.

[<a id="00-27-57">00:27:57</a>]  He has a presence, which every, even the guy that organizes this, he walked around the

[<a id="00-28-06">00:28:06</a>]  room while Louie was singing, he said the crazy thing was everybody from the front row

[<a id="00-28-12">00:28:12</a>]  to the back row was fascinated by what he's doing, and this was not the room that was

[<a id="00-28-17">00:28:17</a>]  set up for comedy either, it was not a theater, it was a convention center.

[<a id="00-28-21">00:28:21</a>]  - Yeah, it's like a TED talk, right, so yeah.

[<a id="00-28-24">00:28:24</a>]  - As Yoda was as strong he is, you know, the force with that guy, 'cause I'm, I didn't

[<a id="00-28-31">00:28:31</a>]  know who he was when I met, you know, 'cause I was hanging out with Jim Norton, I was open

[<a id="00-28-34">00:28:34</a>]  for him, and I met Jim because, you know, he was one of, he was hosting AVN, I met him,

[<a id="00-28-40">00:28:40</a>]  and a couple people told him, hey, you know, you should talk to Yoshi because he doesn't

[<a id="00-28-42">00:28:42</a>]  stand up and he was evil, and that's how I met him like over 20 years ago, and then when

[<a id="00-28-46">00:28:46</a>]  he was in Aspen Comedy Festival when Jim and Russell was performing, and that was also

[<a id="00-28-57">00:28:57</a>]  the Aspen where David Chappelle reappeared for some long time, I saw Louie, and I don't

[<a id="00-29-03">00:29:03</a>]  know who he was, and man, he really is like a Jedi master, you know, like Obi-Wan kind

[<a id="00-29-11">00:29:11</a>]  of thing, because when I saw him do Lucky Louie, I went to every episode of taping,

[<a id="00-29-17">00:29:17</a>]  'cause Jim Norton was on the show, so I had a behind the scene kind of thing, right?

[<a id="00-29-20">00:29:20</a>]  - Oh, wow.

[<a id="00-29-21">00:29:21</a>]  - Dude, I'm sorry, and I know most people don't know American football reference, but

[<a id="00-29-26">00:29:26</a>]  Peyton Manning, one of the greatest quarterback, he watched the defense, he knew exactly what's

[<a id="00-29-32">00:29:32</a>]  going on, he'll tell his offensive line what's going on, telling all the player, and he already

[<a id="00-29-37">00:29:37</a>]  know every one of those motherfucking defensive side, what their chess board move's gonna

[<a id="00-29-41">00:29:41</a>]  be anticipating before it happens, right?

[<a id="00-29-44">00:29:44</a>]  Louie, okay, he wrote the fucking show, he did the casting, he's a show runner.

[<a id="00-29-50">00:29:50</a>]  - He did the whole thing by himself.

[<a id="00-29-52">00:29:52</a>]  - He's act on it, he's directing some of them, and he's doing warm up, he could tell how

[<a id="00-29-59">00:29:59</a>]  to rearrange the light, he could fix all the equipment, he's gonna be the editing, do you

[<a id="00-30-03">00:30:03</a>]  know what I'm saying?

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  - Yes.

[<a id="00-30-05">00:30:05</a>]  - It's just a freak of nature, this guy, so I wasn't like, who the fuck, I mean, I'm amazed

[<a id="00-30-11">00:30:11</a>]  by Jim, because he's amazing comic too, but Louie really is like, you know, one of the

[<a id="00-30-16">00:30:16</a>]  highest comedy IQ, and you know, it's amazing, and you know, and because I work in sex business,

[<a id="00-30-26">00:30:26</a>]  it's not a popular thing to say, but when I talk to my sex worker friends, it's like,

[<a id="00-30-31">00:30:31</a>]  wait, so he just jacked off and came, yeah, did he cum on their faces, no, so he just

[<a id="00-30-39">00:30:39</a>]  wasted those sperm, and, because nobody important that he did anything wrong, you know, so,

[<a id="00-30-50">00:30:50</a>]  now, I'm excited, because in a really weird way, I make Lord of the Rings reference, when

[<a id="00-30-56">00:30:56</a>]  Gandalf disappeared and looked like he died, Louie is Louie the White.

[<a id="00-31-01">00:31:01</a>]  - Yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-31-02">00:31:02</a>]  - He's come back.

[<a id="00-31-03">00:31:03</a>]  - He's back, and he's back with the vengeance.

[<a id="00-31-05">00:31:05</a>]  - That's beautiful.

[<a id="00-31-07">00:31:07</a>]  - That he has no longer have to worry about the cobra, and he could do anything.

[<a id="00-31-12">00:31:12</a>]  - I didn't realize that you didn't just get beat up because you were a stupid kid, you're

[<a id="00-31-15">00:31:15</a>]  also a fucking nerd, talking about fucking Gandalf references.

[<a id="00-31-20">00:31:20</a>]  - Everybody knows that kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-31-25">00:31:25</a>]  But I did get that, he faggot and getting punched in the face, virtual wizard now, I

[<a id="00-31-30">00:31:30</a>]  remember that.

[<a id="00-31-31">00:31:31</a>]  - Yeah.

[<a id="00-31-32">00:31:32</a>]  - When I got kicked out of Washington State, and then we were sent to a different aunt

[<a id="00-31-35">00:31:35</a>]  in Orange County, I mean, LA, we were living in Long Beach in mid-1985, summer of, and

[<a id="00-31-44">00:31:44</a>]  I grew up with this black family named Patton's, they're the only black people I know, four

[<a id="00-31-49">00:31:49</a>]  boys and one daughter, and when I was hanging out with them, we started playing Dungeons

[<a id="00-31-56">00:31:56</a>]  Dragon, so I made a mistake thinking all black people play Dungeons Dragon, right?

[<a id="00-32-02">00:32:02</a>]  Of course, only fucking nerds played it, this is such a white nerd thing.

[<a id="00-32-05">00:32:05</a>]  - It's such a nerd fest.

[<a id="00-32-07">00:32:07</a>]  - But it was just such a really weird, I'm hanging out with them, and I could only play

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  Dungeons Dragon Sunday after I go to church with the family, and when you get back, yeah,

[<a id="00-32-15">00:32:15</a>]  and then play Dungeons Dragon, so when we got kicked out of like--

[<a id="00-32-19">00:32:19</a>]  - Wait, wait, wait, hold on, what type of character did you like to play?

[<a id="00-32-23">00:32:23</a>]  - I had a bunch of different characters, you know, like I had a paladin character, I had

[<a id="00-32-27">00:32:27</a>]  a dwarven fighter thief, and I had one with a gray elf fighter thief, magic, that sort

[<a id="00-32-34">00:32:34</a>]  of thing.

[<a id="00-32-35">00:32:35</a>]  - I wanna kill myself.

[<a id="00-32-36">00:32:36</a>]  - No, because it's interesting that the choice of character, like being a paladin is a gay

[<a id="00-32-42">00:32:42</a>]  thing to be in Dungeons and Dragons.

[<a id="00-32-45">00:32:45</a>]  - But this makes me very suspicious, because you have to be gay enough to know what that

[<a id="00-32-48">00:32:48</a>]  is, and you already know that.

[<a id="00-32-49">00:32:49</a>]  - Oh, I know, I, yeah.

[<a id="00-32-50">00:32:50</a>]  - You played Dungeons and Dragons.

[<a id="00-32-52">00:32:52</a>]  - Yeah, I played the English version of it, but it was made by the guys that did Lara

[<a id="00-32-57">00:32:57</a>]  Croft, Steve Jackson.

[<a id="00-32-58">00:32:58</a>]  - Wait, does that have anything to do with Magic the Gathering?

[<a id="00-33-01">00:33:01</a>]  Is it the same show?

[<a id="00-33-02">00:33:02</a>]  - Magic the Gathering is how the wizards of the West Coast, so the Dungeons and Dragons

[<a id="00-33-08">00:33:08</a>]  company.

[<a id="00-33-09">00:33:09</a>]  - Wow, he really knows that stuff.

[<a id="00-33-10">00:33:10</a>]  - They figured out this is how we can make serious money.

[<a id="00-33-13">00:33:13</a>]  - Can we talk about football?

[<a id="00-33-15">00:33:15</a>]  Or rugby?

[<a id="00-33-16">00:33:16</a>]  - Here's the thing, here's the thing, none of these really are different, because--

[<a id="00-33-20">00:33:20</a>]  - I gotta, this is Ben, sorry, yep.

[<a id="00-33-31">00:33:31</a>]  - Can you say it first, 'cause we're in the middle of a podcast?

[<a id="00-33-43">00:33:43</a>]  - You should come now.

[<a id="00-33-44">00:33:44</a>]  - You should come now, come straight, cool, yep.

[<a id="00-33-52">00:33:52</a>]  - But see, none of these things are really, really different, because if you're having

[<a id="00-33-54">00:33:54</a>]  a difficult life and you're in pain, you have to create fantasy to protect you, so there's

[<a id="00-34-00">00:34:00</a>]  no difference in having fantasy of watching sports, fantasy of Dungeons and Dragons, fantasy

[<a id="00-34-06">00:34:06</a>]  of a gay dwarf, or fantasy of pornography, none of these things are really different,

[<a id="00-34-11">00:34:11</a>]  because you, fantasy's fine, if it's fantasy with a lowercase f, but the problem is, keep

[<a id="00-34-20">00:34:20</a>]  hammering this idea, if you have a fantasy with a capital F and you're positioned apart,

[<a id="00-34-28">00:34:28</a>]  you erect, ironically, a terrible nightmare to the world, you know?

[<a id="00-34-31">00:34:31</a>]  - So here's a question based on what you're saying in Switzerland, do you think there

[<a id="00-34-36">00:34:36</a>]  is a thing that people here might, the fantasy is real, in effect, like the fantasy, basic

[<a id="00-34-45">00:34:45</a>]  fantasy of what a lot of people dream of, of comfortable life, clean, money, food, whatever,

[<a id="00-34-53">00:34:53</a>]  and that, in turn, leaves an absence or something like that, and do you get what I'm saying?

[<a id="00-35-02">00:35:02</a>]  - Yeah, you know what I was thinking, when I went to that fancy hotel last night, had

[<a id="00-35-08">00:35:08</a>]  a nice drink, and as I'm nibbling those delicious treats that they were giving you, I was reading

[<a id="00-35-15">00:35:15</a>]  the Swiss history, I find it really interesting, the Swiss military was so fucking powerful,

[<a id="00-35-23">00:35:23</a>]  they were just outstanding, you know, it kind of reminds me of the New England Patriots

[<a id="00-35-29">00:35:29</a>]  when they were winning all those fucking Super Bowls, right, they were just dominating and

[<a id="00-35-32">00:35:32</a>]  just destroying people, right?

[<a id="00-35-34">00:35:34</a>]  To the point in 1499, when finally, they had so many victories, and they just, Emperor

[<a id="00-35-40">00:35:40</a>]  Maximilian I capitulated, just give up, and then this Confederacy happened, and of course,

[<a id="00-35-47">00:35:47</a>]  you had a little bit of a problem under Napoleon, you had what, Treaty of Westphalia 1648, but

[<a id="00-35-53">00:35:53</a>]  you had all these things, but eventually had a neutrality, but how did you end a neutrality?

[<a id="00-35-58">00:35:58</a>]  You did have this physical violence that made it happen, right, because you have so many

[<a id="00-36-03">00:36:03</a>]  entities who want to control Holy Roman Emperor, Habsburg, Burgundians, whatever you call them,

[<a id="00-36-08">00:36:08</a>]  so because somebody fought so hard to make such a peaceful, wonderful place, what is

[<a id="00-36-14">00:36:14</a>]  the end result?

[<a id="00-36-16">00:36:16</a>]  Peaceful people have plenty of time to dream and fantasize things, you know.

[<a id="00-36-21">00:36:21</a>]  Some fantasies were good, some fantasies were bad, and there are definitely ugly ones, you

[<a id="00-36-26">00:36:26</a>]  know, so I think, I really like talking to Christian because he's been going to World

[<a id="00-36-32">00:36:32</a>]  Economic Forum for like over the years, he has such expensive view of what happened,

[<a id="00-36-37">00:36:37</a>]  you know, it's almost like talking to a rabbi, like he has like a big Old Testament

[<a id="00-36-44">00:36:44</a>]  biblical view, but I just went like one time, you know, because I think, why do so many

[<a id="00-36-49">00:36:49</a>]  people suffer, you know, they don't have enough resources to take care of themselves, they're

[<a id="00-36-53">00:36:53</a>]  good people, they're nothing, but so this, that's why I studied econ a lot, because out

[<a id="00-36-59">00:36:59</a>]  of all the social science, you get Nobel Prize in economics, right, so I had this wishful

[<a id="00-37-05">00:37:05</a>]  thinking when I was studying econ, because it's, surprisingly, it's one of the few things

[<a id="00-37-08">00:37:08</a>]  I did well.

[<a id="00-37-10">00:37:10</a>]  Which is also not in science.

[<a id="00-37-13">00:37:13</a>]  Yeah, it's, and I thought it was going to be really good accounting and terrible economics,

[<a id="00-37-18">00:37:18</a>]  it was completely opposite, I couldn't make any sense accounting, but econ is not like

[<a id="00-37-25">00:37:25</a>]  math or practical, physical engineering, it's a way of thinking, yeah, so when you have

[<a id="00-37-32">00:37:32</a>]  a little bit of thinking, adding pornography, like my boss John Ciliano, I had those opportunities,

[<a id="00-37-38">00:37:38</a>]  I met these people in a big way, I don't want to say their name, because I met through one

[<a id="00-37-42">00:37:42</a>]  of my friends and they're prominent people, but yeah, so I think, I'm interested in like

[<a id="00-37-48">00:37:48</a>]  sex and money, because talk about two forces, they're not the only force that moved the

[<a id="00-37-56">00:37:56</a>]  world, but it's pretty significant, if you're being honest about it, you know, and Switzerland

[<a id="00-38-01">00:38:01</a>]  is like one of those key pieces, I think.

[<a id="00-38-03">00:38:03</a>]  I mean, it's ironic in a way that both of them actually mean so little, because money

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  -

[<a id="00-38-10">00:38:10</a>]  To happiness?

[<a id="00-38-11">00:38:11</a>]  Yeah, money is in any way just a thing we made up, and sex, once you've had some, you're

[<a id="00-38-17">00:38:17</a>]  just like, yeah, whatever, it's like.

[<a id="00-38-20">00:38:20</a>]  But don't you think -

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  Until you have it again.

[<a id="00-38-22">00:38:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-38-23">00:38:23</a>]  But don't you think these, is there 100 francs?

[<a id="00-38-26">00:38:26</a>]  No?

[<a id="00-38-27">00:38:27</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-38-28">00:38:28</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-38-29">00:38:29</a>]  At the end of the day, it's just -

[<a id="00-38-30">00:38:30</a>]  There's a thousand.

[<a id="00-38-31">00:38:31</a>]  So there's a thousand francs, but at the end of the day, it's fucking paper, right?

[<a id="00-38-36">00:38:36</a>]  But why is it valid?

[<a id="00-38-37">00:38:37</a>]  Because enough people believe in it.

[<a id="00-38-39">00:38:39</a>]  I'm not really religious, but if enough people believe in God, I guess it is real enough.

[<a id="00-38-44">00:38:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-38-45">00:38:45</a>]  You know?

[<a id="00-38-46">00:38:46</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-38-47">00:38:47</a>]  So there's so many elements over here, like you have Freud to live here, Carl Jung, Nietzsche,

[<a id="00-38-51">00:38:51</a>]  you even have Lenin and all that money stuff, and you have so many people from different

[<a id="00-38-58">00:38:58</a>]  backgrounds that it's like a petri dish of humanity, you know?

[<a id="00-39-03">00:39:03</a>]  And -

[<a id="00-39-04">00:39:04</a>]  So what's -

[<a id="00-39-05">00:39:05</a>]  So that alone is enough for me to visit, but now the comedy scene is palatable to me because

[<a id="00-39-14">00:39:14</a>]  show two nights ago -

[<a id="00-39-15">00:39:15</a>]  Or is it the other way around?

[<a id="00-39-17">00:39:17</a>]  Well, that's true, I guess.

[<a id="00-39-19">00:39:19</a>]  But the show two nights ago tells me I could still do my jokes if I was living here, but

[<a id="00-39-26">00:39:26</a>]  one thing I could do here that's kind of difficult in the States, it's the Tuesday show.

[<a id="00-39-31">00:39:31</a>]  It really gave me hope.

[<a id="00-39-32">00:39:32</a>]  I want to go into this a little bit because what we were trying to do on Tuesday was not

[<a id="00-39-38">00:39:38</a>]  standup.

[<a id="00-39-40">00:39:40</a>]  So it had standup elements at the beginning, and then we kind of did a Q&A kind of format

[<a id="00-39-49">00:39:49</a>]  with the audience.

[<a id="00-39-50">00:39:50</a>]  And the supplemental part did something that even the Scotland show couldn't do it because

[<a id="00-39-56">00:39:56</a>]  I really didn't have a Q&A.

[<a id="00-40-01">00:40:01</a>]  I was a big fan of that format.

[<a id="00-40-05">00:40:05</a>]  Because I was -

[<a id="00-40-06">00:40:06</a>]  You were right.

[<a id="00-40-07">00:40:07</a>]  I was kind of iffy the way you felt iffy about Memphis jokes.

[<a id="00-40-11">00:40:11</a>]  Sure.

[<a id="00-40-13">00:40:13</a>]  It was interesting how engaged the audience was.

[<a id="00-40-18">00:40:18</a>]  Like the questions -

[<a id="00-40-19">00:40:19</a>]  It was shocking.

[<a id="00-40-20">00:40:20</a>]  The questions that were asked were not just like, "It's porn weird."

[<a id="00-40-24">00:40:24</a>]  It's more like there were some really deep questions about stuff.

[<a id="00-40-30">00:40:30</a>]  I've got to tell you, every one of them were thoughtful, just like 95% of my audience at

[<a id="00-40-36">00:40:36</a>]  Inbrow's Fringe last year was.

[<a id="00-40-40">00:40:40</a>]  I think this is also something like we have a tendency to think of comedy, sometimes this

[<a id="00-40-48">00:40:48</a>]  is how it has to be.

[<a id="00-40-51">00:40:51</a>]  But there is so much within comedy and podcasting, for starters, that it's not standup.

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  It's conversation really.

[<a id="00-41-00">00:41:00</a>]  And I think people like being included, like having a conversation.

[<a id="00-41-05">00:41:05</a>]  There's more to it than that, I think as well.

[<a id="00-41-08">00:41:08</a>]  Sometimes doing comedy in Switzerland, we tend to think we're - or at least I tend to

[<a id="00-41-15">00:41:15</a>]  think I'm better than the audience because I have the balls to get up on stage.

[<a id="00-41-20">00:41:20</a>]  But from time to time, I get reminded we're living in a country of extremely smart people

[<a id="00-41-26">00:41:26</a>]  because you have to be qualified as a foreigner.

[<a id="00-41-29">00:41:29</a>]  The foreigners especially here, like any foreigner you meet here, even if they're emptying rubbish,

[<a id="00-41-37">00:41:37</a>]  there's brains here.

[<a id="00-41-38">00:41:38</a>]  And so -

[<a id="00-41-39">00:41:39</a>]  I didn't even think about that.

[<a id="00-41-41">00:41:41</a>]  So that's where there's like a level of the deep questions is, these are smart people.

[<a id="00-41-47">00:41:47</a>]  I mean, I talked to a few of the audience members.

[<a id="00-41-51">00:41:51</a>]  One of them was doing this like financial modelling of companies and this kind of stuff.

[<a id="00-41-57">00:41:57</a>]  They're coming up with a genuine curiosity.

[<a id="00-42-00">00:42:00</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-42-01">00:42:01</a>]  And yeah, I know where I'm going with that.

[<a id="00-42-05">00:42:05</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-42-06">00:42:06</a>]  Well said.

[<a id="00-42-07">00:42:07</a>]  I was surprised - surprisingly, the shows I did - the first day I did it last year,

[<a id="00-42-16">00:42:16</a>]  it was the 20th anniversary of me receiving an email from my cousin.

[<a id="00-42-23">00:42:23</a>]  Was that the first email that you ever sent or what are you referring to?

[<a id="00-42-28">00:42:28</a>]  Well, it's - it was my friend's birthday, Carolyn Carrington.

[<a id="00-42-36">00:42:36</a>]  She's considered the greatest female jazz drummer.

[<a id="00-42-40">00:42:40</a>]  She's a friend of mine.

[<a id="00-42-41">00:42:41</a>]  When she was 16, she was playing with Miles Davis too.

[<a id="00-42-44">00:42:44</a>]  So it was her birthday and my friend is her cousin so we were hanging out.

[<a id="00-42-48">00:42:48</a>]  And then I got home and I got an email and it's from my cousin and I shouldn't be laughing

[<a id="00-42-54">00:42:54</a>]  but it was basically, they're emailing me because my father passed away.

[<a id="00-42-58">00:42:58</a>]  But the email had just two words, "Papa dead."

[<a id="00-43-02">00:43:02</a>]  That's it.

[<a id="00-43-04">00:43:04</a>]  It wasn't like -

[<a id="00-43-05">00:43:05</a>]  That was the whole message.

[<a id="00-43-06">00:43:06</a>]  "Sorry to write you this sad note.

[<a id="00-43-10">00:43:10</a>]  Your father sadly passed away last night."

[<a id="00-43-11">00:43:11</a>]  It wasn't like that.

[<a id="00-43-12">00:43:12</a>]  It just said - when I told that to Tom Segura in his podcast, he couldn't stop - he didn't

[<a id="00-43-16">00:43:16</a>]  want to laugh but he couldn't stop laughing because how curt my family is, you know.

[<a id="00-43-22">00:43:22</a>]  In my family, you're only allowed to show two emotions like - well, three - complete

[<a id="00-43-29">00:43:29</a>]  silence, laughter, but most important one, their favorite one is just the sign of expression

[<a id="00-43-37">00:43:37</a>]  of anger and rage, you know.

[<a id="00-43-39">00:43:39</a>]  So -

[<a id="00-43-40">00:43:40</a>]  This was an expression of rage.

[<a id="00-43-42">00:43:42</a>]  Well, I don't know what my cousin was thinking but I mean, I laughed and I was in tears.

[<a id="00-43-53">00:43:53</a>]  But anyway, my first show on InBroad was exactly on the 20th anniversary of that day.

[<a id="00-44-01">00:44:01</a>]  And August has always been tough because I just keep remembering - I don't know exactly

[<a id="00-44-04">00:44:04</a>]  what day my dad passed away.

[<a id="00-44-05">00:44:05</a>]  They found his body decomposed and then he was hanging from ceiling and whatnot for a

[<a id="00-44-12">00:44:12</a>]  long time.

[<a id="00-44-13">00:44:13</a>]  And the last conversation I had with him was just argument because he just - I sometimes

[<a id="00-44-18">00:44:18</a>]  forget not everyone's like me that they could fight and just talk shit back to people that

[<a id="00-44-23">00:44:23</a>]  hurt them, you know.

[<a id="00-44-24">00:44:24</a>]  My dad didn't know how to do that.

[<a id="00-44-26">00:44:26</a>]  So I think I was supposed to do 23 shows.

[<a id="00-44-30">00:44:30</a>]  I missed one because I went to Liverpool for a day because there was a serial killer conference

[<a id="00-44-35">00:44:35</a>]  so I went to that one and back.

[<a id="00-44-37">00:44:37</a>]  But other than -

[<a id="00-44-38">00:44:38</a>]  A serial killer conference?

[<a id="00-44-39">00:44:39</a>]  So I took a bus over to Liverpool and saw this lady talk about serial killers.

[<a id="00-44-42">00:44:42</a>]  Sorry, are there a lot of serial killers out there that are meeting for conferences or

[<a id="00-44-47">00:44:47</a>]  are these fans of serial killers?

[<a id="00-44-49">00:44:49</a>]  They're talking about serial killers and they are a fan of serial killers because two-thirds

[<a id="00-44-56">00:44:56</a>]  of the audience are women always.

[<a id="00-44-57">00:44:57</a>]  And 10% of the room are the future content for the government.

[<a id="00-45-03">00:45:03</a>]  So I did the shows.

[<a id="00-45-06">00:45:06</a>]  I didn't know what I was doing.

[<a id="00-45-09">00:45:09</a>]  But I always thought that even if you don't know what you're doing, it's better to do

[<a id="00-45-13">00:45:13</a>]  something than nothing because too many people say I want to do this someday but I think

[<a id="00-45-17">00:45:17</a>]  that's a mistake.

[<a id="00-45-18">00:45:18</a>]  You know the example I always tell you, you could travel from L.A. to New York.

[<a id="00-45-26">00:45:26</a>]  You could do all the preparation but eventually you have to leave.

[<a id="00-45-29">00:45:29</a>]  Sometimes you get paralyzed by over-preparation and fear.

[<a id="00-45-33">00:45:33</a>]  So I did it and I think the last six or seven days it got to the point where it was surprising.

[<a id="00-45-40">00:45:40</a>]  It's kind of hitting them hard too.

[<a id="00-45-43">00:45:43</a>]  But I think the Tuesday show did something too.

[<a id="00-45-47">00:45:47</a>]  That was something that I want to say.

[<a id="00-45-50">00:45:50</a>]  I don't know what you guys were expecting.

[<a id="00-45-54">00:45:54</a>]  The thing is, two things.

[<a id="00-45-56">00:45:56</a>]  One thing is talking to you about that show, every time I try to formulate a meaningful

[<a id="00-46-01">00:46:01</a>]  thought about it, there's something you go, "No, no, no, no, no."

[<a id="00-46-10">00:46:10</a>]  There you go.

[<a id="00-46-14">00:46:14</a>]  Because I think you learn more from things you didn't do right.

[<a id="00-46-17">00:46:17</a>]  Oh yeah.

[<a id="00-46-18">00:46:18</a>]  That's all.

[<a id="00-46-19">00:46:19</a>]  I'm not saying whether it's right or wrong but there was a kind, it's gross, but there's

[<a id="00-46-23">00:46:23</a>]  kind of magic in the room by the end of the show.

[<a id="00-46-27">00:46:27</a>]  There was somebody, even I met that, oh I met that too.

[<a id="00-46-31">00:46:31</a>]  Was magic gathering?

[<a id="00-46-32">00:46:32</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-46-33">00:46:33</a>]  See, you fucking comedians.

[<a id="00-46-36">00:46:36</a>]  I have to admit that's funny.

[<a id="00-46-40">00:46:40</a>]  I already knew by his look that I was under his rolodex, he was going to use it.

[<a id="00-46-46">00:46:46</a>]  So the thing was, because I was sat next to you.

[<a id="00-46-49">00:46:49</a>]  Well, you want to tell exactly what happened?

[<a id="00-46-51">00:46:51</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-46-52">00:46:52</a>]  Because I was supposed to do time but you didn't exactly what I was going to say.

[<a id="00-46-55">00:46:55</a>]  I mean you didn't.

[<a id="00-46-56">00:46:56</a>]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[<a id="00-46-57">00:46:57</a>]  So you format the show.

[<a id="00-46-58">00:46:58</a>]  No, no, no.

[<a id="00-46-59">00:46:59</a>]  Well, format, tell them the format but also what you thought was going to do versus what

[<a id="00-47-04">00:47:04</a>]  happened.

[<a id="00-47-05">00:47:05</a>]  It's the same thing?

[<a id="00-47-06">00:47:06</a>]  Okay, so first of all, I had no intention, so what we did, we did first half stand up

[<a id="00-47-11">00:47:11</a>]  comedy.

[<a id="00-47-12">00:47:12</a>]  I played the role of the fluffer for Yoshi to get the audience in a dark space and then

[<a id="00-47-16">00:47:16</a>]  Yoshi did some did some jokes about that relate to your life and then the second half we do

[<a id="00-47-23">00:47:23</a>]  a live podcast.

[<a id="00-47-24">00:47:24</a>]  So it's me, Chris and Yoshi facing the audience.

[<a id="00-47-26">00:47:26</a>]  We had a very small crowd, it was like 10-15 people.

[<a id="00-47-30">00:47:30</a>]  But you know what?

[<a id="00-47-32">00:47:32</a>]  This magic, so-called magic, do you call it?

[<a id="00-47-35">00:47:35</a>]  It was so powerful.

[<a id="00-47-38">00:47:38</a>]  I swear that tent felt like a hundred people in that room.

[<a id="00-47-43">00:47:43</a>]  Yeah, absolutely.

[<a id="00-47-44">00:47:44</a>]  And the thing is, like the first two-thirds of the second half, I'm just acting like the

[<a id="00-47-50">00:47:50</a>]  guy that makes a funny remark originally, but then there was a noticeable shift in the

[<a id="00-47-56">00:47:56</a>]  mood of everyone there.

[<a id="00-47-59">00:47:59</a>]  There was one lady who was actually tearing up openly and I think-

[<a id="00-48-05">00:48:05</a>]  That kind of shocked me.

[<a id="00-48-08">00:48:08</a>]  I looked a little bit at what happened there and I think it was something you were saying

[<a id="00-48-13">00:48:13</a>]  about what Asian families are like and this lady happened to be Asian and-

[<a id="00-48-20">00:48:20</a>]  When you make a career path like mine, not only do you feel isolated from your work,

[<a id="00-48-27">00:48:27</a>]  your friends and acquaintances in the society, but that's a really tough one to take from

[<a id="00-48-32">00:48:32</a>]  family members, you know?

[<a id="00-48-33">00:48:33</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-34">00:48:34</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-48-35">00:48:35</a>]  And I got the sense that what was going on with her is you-

[<a id="00-48-39">00:48:39</a>]  Maybe I made her remember something?

[<a id="00-48-43">00:48:43</a>]  I think it was more than that.

[<a id="00-48-44">00:48:44</a>]  It wasn't this kind of like sobbing some shit, "I've got to go and leave now."

[<a id="00-48-49">00:48:49</a>]  It was almost like someone got over a trauma.

[<a id="00-48-53">00:48:53</a>]  It was like something she'd been hiding and then she would realize that you'd been through

[<a id="00-48-58">00:48:58</a>]  something.

[<a id="00-48-59">00:48:59</a>]  Similar.

[<a id="00-49-00">00:49:00</a>]  And then suddenly it was no longer like, "Oh, I need to carry this burden."

[<a id="00-49-04">00:49:04</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-05">00:49:05</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-06">00:49:06</a>]  And it's very touching at the end and yeah, I think-

[<a id="00-49-10">00:49:10</a>]  It was surprising.

[<a id="00-49-11">00:49:11</a>]  I wasn't really expecting that.

[<a id="00-49-14">00:49:14</a>]  Did you talk to them after?

[<a id="00-49-18">00:49:18</a>]  I think it was- They went pretty quickly after.

[<a id="00-49-22">00:49:22</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-49-23">00:49:23</a>]  I mean, it was a pretty long show too.

[<a id="00-49-25">00:49:25</a>]  I spoke briefly with them and I'm like, "Everything okay?"

[<a id="00-49-29">00:49:29</a>]  They're like, "Yeah, this was amazing."

[<a id="00-49-31">00:49:31</a>]  They're like pure positivity about the show.

[<a id="00-49-33">00:49:33</a>]  Right.

[<a id="00-49-34">00:49:34</a>]  Okay.

[<a id="00-49-35">00:49:35</a>]  Because sometimes you can tell after a show, even if they say something positive, but you

[<a id="00-49-41">00:49:41</a>]  can totally tell it's like, "Oh, I fucking hated it."

[<a id="00-49-44">00:49:44</a>]  That's what happened yesterday.

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  I got carried away.

[<a id="00-49-51">00:49:51</a>]  It was interesting.

[<a id="00-49-53">00:49:53</a>]  It was really interesting because there was a lady on both sides of the audience and we

[<a id="00-50-01">00:50:01</a>]  kept- Because I'm just watching while I'm watching the audience.

[<a id="00-50-04">00:50:04</a>]  Wait, was she a demon?

[<a id="00-50-05">00:50:05</a>]  I was like, "No, no, no."

[<a id="00-50-07">00:50:07</a>]  Two separate individuals and one we talked to after the show.

[<a id="00-50-12">00:50:12</a>]  The other one just left.

[<a id="00-50-15">00:50:15</a>]  The weird thing is is that the middle group were with you, but also they were gradually

[<a id="00-50-19">00:50:19</a>]  becoming like, "Yoshi, we're trying to be on your side, but you're making it worse."

[<a id="00-50-26">00:50:26</a>]  And one of the groups like, "You know that third rate joke?"

[<a id="00-50-32">00:50:32</a>]  And that's what I said to you after, like in Switzerland we call, I'm making the R word,

[<a id="00-50-37">00:50:37</a>]  it's like the N word is in a way not such an issue here because we don't have black

[<a id="00-50-43">00:50:43</a>]  people.

[<a id="00-50-44">00:50:44</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-50-45">00:50:45</a>]  And it's a funny word.

[<a id="00-50-46">00:50:46</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-50-47">00:50:47</a>]  But the R word, you can't, like back in, I stopped doing it back in the first year.

[<a id="00-50-52">00:50:52</a>]  By the way, when I say N word, I'm from Japan, nuclear, just to be aware of.

[<a id="00-50-57">00:50:57</a>]  Nice.

[<a id="00-50-58">00:50:58</a>]  Go ahead.

[<a id="00-50-59">00:50:59</a>]  Yeah, so, and it's a thing that the moment you say the word, it's like you've got to

[<a id="00-51-07">00:51:07</a>]  be ready to navigate that.

[<a id="00-51-12">00:51:12</a>]  I'm still glad I did it because I kind of understood like that's definitely the boundaries

[<a id="00-51-17">00:51:17</a>]  that I know about this place, but what I really appreciate after when we were leaving, one

[<a id="00-51-22">00:51:22</a>]  of the girls like, "You know, I didn't like you and the things you say," and I explained

[<a id="00-51-25">00:51:25</a>]  like why I didn't like, "Oh, I wish you would have said that, it would have been more palatable."

[<a id="00-51-29">00:51:29</a>]  Because I think it's not that she said that you could never talk about that because there's

[<a id="00-51-33">00:51:33</a>]  plenty of movies.

[<a id="00-51-34">00:51:34</a>]  No, but these things, these stories rely on context.

[<a id="00-51-37">00:51:37</a>]  Yes.

[<a id="00-51-38">00:51:38</a>]  And sometimes I forget American audience, they have a short hand for understanding stand-up

[<a id="00-51-45">00:51:45</a>]  comedy and maybe they don't know that, you know?

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  So I still have to have plenty of good shows, but I need to have plenty of bad shows so

[<a id="00-51-54">00:51:54</a>]  I understand what I'm working with, so I'm kind of still learning, but this is completely

[<a id="00-52-00">00:52:00</a>]  worth it for me this whole week because I think there was a chance I might do some other

[<a id="00-52-06">00:52:06</a>]  big project and I'm kind of like not sure if that's going to happen, but this I have

[<a id="00-52-09">00:52:09</a>]  100% control whether I do it or not, I could force myself to do it.

[<a id="00-52-15">00:52:15</a>]  And then working with you guys really helped because you guys really are the reach hard

[<a id="00-52-18">00:52:18</a>]  whisperers and because you kind of get it, you know?

[<a id="00-52-24">00:52:24</a>]  I want to tell you something that I experienced yesterday in that context because I work in

[<a id="00-52-32">00:52:32</a>]  a little theatre every now and then and do tech and sound and yesterday night I worked

[<a id="00-52-40">00:52:40</a>]  at a Spanish show, it's a Venezuelan act called Luis Chatein, he now resides in Miami, this

[<a id="00-52-49">00:52:49</a>]  is kind of like, I think it's the second time that I've done tech for that guy.

[<a id="00-52-54">00:52:54</a>]  Obviously all Spanish speaking.

[<a id="00-52-56">00:52:56</a>]  All Spanish speaking, but here's what baffled me and these are all the fucking theories

[<a id="00-53-02">00:53:02</a>]  about stand-up comedy, this is a man who does nothing but storytelling, 100% like from the

[<a id="00-53-08">00:53:08</a>]  first moment he's on stage, it's all stories, story, story, story and then another story

[<a id="00-53-14">00:53:14</a>]  and then another story.

[<a id="00-53-16">00:53:16</a>]  This guy does 130 minutes, 140 minutes straight and they are on board like from the very beginning

[<a id="00-53-28">00:53:28</a>]  of the show.

[<a id="00-53-29">00:53:29</a>]  It already starts weird, like he goes on stage, it's all like before the show and after show,

[<a id="00-53-35">00:53:35</a>]  all very organized but as soon as he's on stage it's chaos and then it's story after

[<a id="00-53-40">00:53:40</a>]  story after story.

[<a id="00-53-41">00:53:41</a>]  It's like sitting with your drunk uncle at the Christmas table and the punchlines, they

[<a id="00-53-48">00:53:48</a>]  come thick and fast at the beginning, in the middle they drop off but it's never contemplative

[<a id="00-53-54">00:53:54</a>]  too much or whatever, it doesn't go into awe and then my life was shit and then I recovered

[<a id="00-54-00">00:54:00</a>]  or whatever but it's just kind of like longer stories and then at the end it's shorter stories

[<a id="00-54-04">00:54:04</a>]  again and it's thick and fast and I was just baffled by the sheer quality of story, story,

[<a id="00-54-13">00:54:13</a>]  story, story, story and there's nothing that I can go like oh this is what the show was

[<a id="00-54-18">00:54:18</a>]  about, zero.

[<a id="00-54-20">00:54:20</a>]  There was so many different things that he was talking about.

[<a id="00-54-23">00:54:23</a>]  I mean he doesn't actually speak Spanish but yeah, it's all right.

[<a id="00-54-29">00:54:29</a>]  You're a little bit of a cunt there.

[<a id="00-54-33">00:54:33</a>]  I completely understand, I completely understand in a way that just like any woman traveling

[<a id="00-54-47">00:54:47</a>]  anywhere in the world and they watch soap opera, it's not their language but if they

[<a id="00-54-52">00:54:52</a>]  watch it from beginning to end they don't even speak one word but they understand what

[<a id="00-54-56">00:54:56</a>]  the fuck is going on.

[<a id="00-54-57">00:54:57</a>]  That guy is cheating on you, it's incredible so I think one of the benefits when I lost

[<a id="00-55-06">00:55:06</a>]  my job in 2012, that wasn't just a job, it's a place I was hanging out with people who

[<a id="00-55-13">00:55:13</a>]  understood me very well, it's a world I feel comfortable with you know so it was really

[<a id="00-55-17">00:55:17</a>]  difficult to lose that job so I went to...

[<a id="00-55-25">00:55:25</a>]  It's not on the microphone, you can...

[<a id="00-55-29">00:55:29</a>]  I decided to travel a lot but it's around that time I got really serious about watching

[<a id="00-55-35">00:55:35</a>]  a lot of the musicals and plays because I think growing up, being poor, it's just a

[<a id="00-55-41">00:55:41</a>]  negative you know like anything educating people like my family like boo you know or it's like

[<a id="00-55-47">00:55:47</a>]  it's fucking gay.

[<a id="00-55-48">00:55:48</a>]  It is to some extent but I watched so many of those shows like I didn't understand because

[<a id="00-55-53">00:55:53</a>]  I didn't have a formal training like taking acting classes or Broadway show theory or

[<a id="00-56-00">00:56:00</a>]  history and things like that but even for me somebody who watched so many, I mean I

[<a id="00-56-04">00:56:04</a>]  watched minimum 500 shows probably like up to 700-800 shows in the last 12 years.

[<a id="00-56-10">00:56:10</a>]  Like Broadway stuff.

[<a id="00-56-11">00:56:11</a>]  Broadway musicals and all my credit got maxed out because I put a commitment to it and I

[<a id="00-56-18">00:56:18</a>]  watched so many shows and I always get cheapest tickets by getting rush tickets and things

[<a id="00-56-21">00:56:21</a>]  like that right but while I did that, I'm watching these shows, I'm trying to like make sense

[<a id="00-56-26">00:56:26</a>]  of like why at this age I feel so gravitated to these things and why does it emotionally

[<a id="00-56-34">00:56:34</a>]  feels right but when you're getting rush tickets, those cheap tickets you could get at box office,

[<a id="00-56-40">00:56:40</a>]  I think that might be even the bigger reason I'm sitting next to people who are just obsessed

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  and love Broadway shows and plays and musicals.

[<a id="00-56-49">00:56:49</a>]  From then...

[<a id="00-56-50">00:56:50</a>]  Oh so you're the super fans basically.

[<a id="00-56-51">00:56:51</a>]  I learned a lot, it's like when you have a really good podcast and there's comments and

[<a id="00-56-56">00:56:56</a>]  some comments are better than others but all those years watching Broadway shows, plays

[<a id="00-57-04">00:57:04</a>]  and musicals, it did something to me that maybe I was working out some personal issues,

[<a id="00-57-14">00:57:14</a>]  you know.

[<a id="00-57-15">00:57:15</a>]  Ian McKellen famously said, you know as a young gay man, it's not okay to express those

[<a id="00-57-22">00:57:22</a>]  feelings you know and there's only one place in 50s and 60s and 70s where he is comfortable

[<a id="00-57-31">00:57:31</a>]  to express those feelings as a gay man is theater.

[<a id="00-57-34">00:57:34</a>]  It's the only place you'll be seeing as of who he is, you know.

[<a id="00-57-37">00:57:37</a>]  So when you meet people like that, you watch as many shows.

[<a id="00-57-40">00:57:40</a>]  He came out as Ganda.

[<a id="00-57-43">00:57:43</a>]  And during stand up, it had an impact, you know, because I think somebody once asked

[<a id="00-57-53">00:57:53</a>]  Picasso can you draw me something and that thing, he just kind of quit like a bullshit

[<a id="00-58-03">00:58:03</a>]  and the guys are like wait, so that's worth something and Picasso said yes, I don't understand.

[<a id="00-58-09">00:58:09</a>]  Like how come you could get away with drawing because you have to go decades of those mastering

[<a id="00-58-14">00:58:14</a>]  technical skill and drawing all this realistic picture and once you realize what you could

[<a id="00-58-18">00:58:18</a>]  do with art, then he become a master where that this simple shit that he draw, it's truly

[<a id="00-58-24">00:58:24</a>]  a piece of artwork, you know.

[<a id="00-58-27">00:58:27</a>]  Everybody tried to cut that part and tried to do that kind of shit.

[<a id="00-58-29">00:58:29</a>]  But this is an interesting thing because I mean one thing on the educational front like

[<a id="00-58-33">00:58:33</a>]  I studied physics but I taught myself programming and it's very easy to do and I think that

[<a id="00-58-41">00:58:41</a>]  it's easy for you to do sure that well, but the same with the same with performance.

[<a id="00-58-49">00:58:49</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-51">00:58:51</a>]  Education can give you a lot of cheat codes, yes, but it can't give you the desire to do

[<a id="00-58-56">00:58:56</a>]  it.

[<a id="00-58-57">00:58:57</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="00-58-58">00:58:58</a>]  But what I'm hearing from what you're saying that just a thought is based on what we're

[<a id="00-59-05">00:59:05</a>]  talking about with your childhood, was this a sort of a pursuit for your own identity

[<a id="00-59-12">00:59:12</a>]  where you're watching like you're trying to figure out so who the fuck am I?

[<a id="00-59-16">00:59:16</a>]  I mean I'm sure, now that your son's here too, if somebody significant in your family

[<a id="00-59-22">00:59:22</a>]  died, you're not going to just say Papa dead.

[<a id="00-59-25">00:59:25</a>]  I think, do you know what I mean?

[<a id="00-59-29">00:59:29</a>]  Because this isn't like a grown ass person writing to me.

[<a id="00-59-32">00:59:32</a>]  At that time, that person's pushing 50 years old.

[<a id="00-59-34">00:59:34</a>]  You mean to tell me your cousin's father passed away and the best possible way that you could

[<a id="00-59-42">00:59:42</a>]  communicate the information is not to call the person in person, just fucking email say

[<a id="00-59-46">00:59:46</a>]  Papa dead.

[<a id="00-59-49">00:59:49</a>]  Was there a subject?

[<a id="00-59-50">00:59:50</a>]  This could be the great name for your show by the way.

[<a id="00-59-52">00:59:52</a>]  They didn't even put capitalized P. They didn't even put a period.

[<a id="00-59-57">00:59:57</a>]  Just say Papa dead.

[<a id="00-59-59">00:59:59</a>]  My father.

[<a id="01-00-00">01:00:00</a>]  Was there a subject?

[<a id="01-00-01">01:00:01</a>]  No.

[<a id="01-00-02">01:00:02</a>]  Was that the subject?

[<a id="01-00-03">01:00:03</a>]  Nothing.

[<a id="01-00-04">01:00:04</a>]  Just like I'll just click what's this and like Papa dead and end of it.

[<a id="01-00-07">01:00:07</a>]  Fuck me.

[<a id="01-00-08">01:00:08</a>]  But that might be a better name than adult content for your show because it's very evocative.

[<a id="01-00-15">01:00:15</a>]  No, but I do want to leave people with some positivity and hopefulness.

[<a id="01-00-20">01:00:20</a>]  Oh yeah, yeah, but is it just monk to monk.

[<a id="01-00-24">01:00:24</a>]  But like all the feminists you could get with.

[<a id="01-00-26">01:00:26</a>]  Maybe I could do a podcast called Papa dead, but you know what?

[<a id="01-00-30">01:00:30</a>]  You should put it on the poster.

[<a id="01-00-31">01:00:31</a>]  You know how the comedy posters you always have the reviews of like newspapers or whatever

[<a id="01-00-37">01:00:37</a>]  is like six stars the Guardian just like a Laurel Papa dead.

[<a id="01-00-43">01:00:43</a>]  So I was just like, so I think I mean, it's pretty clear growing up in family emotion

[<a id="01-00-54">01:00:54</a>]  we're very stunted, you know, and I think you need look at the only thing my family's

[<a id="01-01-00">01:01:00</a>]  telling me to only accept the only time to express your feelings anger.

[<a id="01-01-04">01:01:04</a>]  It's like driving a car only could turn right.

[<a id="01-01-07">01:01:07</a>]  You can't turn left.

[<a id="01-01-08">01:01:08</a>]  You mean that's the only option.

[<a id="01-01-09">01:01:09</a>]  We need to go right and left to go in circles.

[<a id="01-01-14">01:01:14</a>]  And so I so weirdly, I think going to the show somehow made it easy for me and it's

[<a id="01-01-19">01:01:19</a>]  okay to have those emotions like weirdly, it wasn't just educating me about show business

[<a id="01-01-24">01:01:24</a>]  and a great culture and art and in which it was by watching the show.

[<a id="01-01-28">01:01:28</a>]  Some of the shows really hit deep, you know, and I didn't see him in person, but one of

[<a id="01-01-33">01:01:33</a>]  my favorite one-man show performer was Baldwin Gray and he did a thing called Swimming in

[<a id="01-01-40">01:01:40</a>]  Cambodia.

[<a id="01-01-41">01:01:41</a>]  It's one of the greatest one-man show and you name it from Colin Quinn to Louis CK to

[<a id="01-01-48">01:01:48</a>]  John Mulaney anybody who has any sort of like thoughtful show very familiar with him sadly,

[<a id="01-01-53">01:01:53</a>]  you know, he when I saw Mulaney first time in person within like 10 feet, weirdly that

[<a id="01-02-00">01:02:00</a>]  week was the 20th anniversary of Spalding Gray killing himself.

[<a id="01-02-04">01:02:04</a>]  He jumped out of ship in New York or something, but that one-man show I mean done like half

[<a id="01-02-10">01:02:10</a>]  a dozen of them incredible and Spalding Gray.

[<a id="01-02-14">01:02:14</a>]  I know a lot of people don't know this.

[<a id="01-02-15">01:02:15</a>]  He actually did some porn scenes when he was younger.

[<a id="01-02-18">01:02:18</a>]  Well, you're a shit.

[<a id="01-02-19">01:02:19</a>]  That's a perfect closing.

[<a id="01-02-20">01:02:20</a>]  I got a perfect wrap-up.

[<a id="01-02-21">01:02:21</a>]  Yeah.

[<a id="01-02-22">01:02:22</a>]  You're going to be doing a one-man show one day.

[<a id="01-02-26">01:02:26</a>]  I can see it.

[<a id="01-02-27">01:02:27</a>]  It'll just be you and no audience.

[<a id="01-02-31">01:02:31</a>]  What a fucking piece of shit.

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  That's really funny.

[<a id="01-02-35">01:02:35</a>]  I never thought of that way.

[<a id="01-02-37">01:02:37</a>]  That's cool.

[<a id="01-02-38">01:02:38</a>]  Hi, guys.

[<a id="01-02-39">01:02:39</a>]  Hello.

[<a id="01-02-40">01:02:40</a>]  Nice to be here.

[<a id="01-02-41">01:02:41</a>]  Can I get someone to drink before?

[<a id="01-02-42">01:02:42</a>]  Yes, of course you can.

[<a id="01-02-43">01:02:43</a>]  Harry, the reason I ask you because I'm afraid to learn to make that, but may I have coffee
