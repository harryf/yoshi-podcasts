[<a id="00-03-27">00:03:27</a>]  you okay so you went over to Athens and since we since we were last recording

[<a id="00-03-32">00:03:32</a>]  which do we remember when when I left I'm trying to make sense out of I'm

[<a id="00-03-36">00:03:36</a>]  trying to all right so wait you left yeah you came and went and then we did I

[<a id="00-03-43">00:03:43</a>]  remember now I left December 2nd and I come back for a day then I left and I've

[<a id="00-03-48">00:03:48</a>]  just come back this morning 3 a.m. I left December 2nd and you came back

[<a id="00-03-57">00:03:57</a>]  on the 17th that's correct and I was here for 17 and I left on 18th and here

[<a id="00-04-06">00:04:06</a>]  I am in 22nd that's right so first you first you went over to Athens you know I

[<a id="00-04-13">00:04:13</a>]  went to Serbia for like 18 hour layover oh yeah yeah in Hades or someplace like

[<a id="00-04-19">00:04:19</a>]  this in the devil's hostel yeah that's right for some reason you think it's

[<a id="00-04-24">00:04:24</a>]  funny El Diablo but the guy running the place was really funny he's clearly gay

[<a id="00-04-29">00:04:29</a>]  and when I saw him like one in the morning and there's a cat there's a

[<a id="00-04-34">00:04:34</a>]  black cat running around me around the youth hostel he goes welcome to my

[<a id="00-04-39">00:04:39</a>]  humble abode and check out my familiar which is like which which reference you

[<a id="00-04-44">00:04:44</a>]  know he was really funny and he has that typical Serbian name Drago there's

[<a id="00-04-51">00:04:51</a>]  almost like a dragon sounding names you know it's really cool one of the night

[<a id="00-04-56">00:04:56</a>]  I used to play for Miami Heat had the similar kind of name but yeah so I was

[<a id="00-05-02">00:05:02</a>]  there for like about a day I guess then I flew into Athens and I was there for

[<a id="00-05-07">00:05:07</a>]  almost two weeks it's always great I'm all I did was spending money but I saw

[<a id="00-05-14">00:05:14</a>]  all my friends there and it's the same thing that Russell Peters been doing it

[<a id="00-05-20">00:05:20</a>]  for 20 years being generous with me but every time I go to Athens even a little

[<a id="00-05-24">00:05:24</a>]  bit of trinket buy them small stuff you know so this is this is correct me if I

[<a id="00-05-32">00:05:32</a>]  wrong it's a bunch of ladies the I think it's like 60 40 because I have plenty of

[<a id="00-05-38">00:05:38</a>]  friends like dirt didn't know they were never like six workers and stuff like

[<a id="00-05-41">00:05:41</a>]  that you know and I'll buy them little trinkets or whatever wait so who I mean

[<a id="00-05-47">00:05:47</a>]  they're a Greek or they were some of them are Greeks but a lot of Slavic

[<a id="00-05-55">00:05:55</a>]  people living down there I didn't make a connection until like 2017 I have a

[<a id="00-06-01">00:06:01</a>]  friend in my go Gunderson he's Danish I met him like close to 10 years because

[<a id="00-06-08">00:06:08</a>]  he was working harm reduction in Denmark so there was a thing called illegal

[<a id="00-06-13">00:06:13</a>]  magazine they used to they still make this magazine illegal magazine in

[<a id="00-06-17">00:06:17</a>]  Copenhagen magazines and written and worked on by many former drug addicts I

[<a id="00-06-25">00:06:25</a>]  mean I've even written a couple articles I'm one of the few wasn't an addict they

[<a id="00-06-31">00:06:31</a>]  make this magazine they go down the street they sell the magazine and when

[<a id="00-06-36">00:06:36</a>]  they get the cash they keep the half the money and they use the other half to buy

[<a id="00-06-40">00:06:40</a>]  more magazine but the money that they make they turn around by drugs okay and

[<a id="00-06-45">00:06:45</a>]  it's a harm reduction program that was starting in Copenhagen so I met a lot of

[<a id="00-06-51">00:06:51</a>]  people there and when I go Gunderson I go I made him in the States through a

[<a id="00-07-04">00:07:04</a>]  mutual friend from the magazine and when he told me like hey you know if you ever

[<a id="00-07-09">00:07:09</a>]  come to Greece I'm in the Greece now I'm working at the refugee camp so at that

[<a id="00-07-12">00:07:12</a>]  point until 2017 I've never been to Greece and ever since 2017 I think

[<a id="00-07-20">00:07:20</a>]  that's the place I've been the most in Europe you know because I met people down

[<a id="00-07-23">00:07:23</a>]  there and changed my life for better and so I've been I have friends down there

[<a id="00-07-32">00:07:32</a>]  you know so it's great it's great that I get a chance to get down there in what

[<a id="00-07-38">00:07:38</a>]  way like change your life for better I'll probably talk more about it in the

[<a id="00-07-46">00:07:46</a>]  show but I was buying a gift for one of my friend's kid I went to this local I

[<a id="00-07-55">00:07:55</a>]  don't know what you call him there's a good story right not too far from here

[<a id="00-08-01">00:08:01</a>]  there's a manga anime and games and shit they have another chef but like they

[<a id="00-08-06">00:08:06</a>]  have a bunch of that kind of stuff so I went one of those place in Athens and

[<a id="00-08-11">00:08:11</a>]  looking for something to buy for my friend's kid and there's this little

[<a id="00-08-15">00:08:15</a>]  girl I mean she's 30 now but when I made hers I think she was 26 or 27 it's one

[<a id="00-08-25">00:08:25</a>]  of the few times where they had a Wi-Fi it in my phone works and I get a phone

[<a id="00-08-28">00:08:28</a>]  call and I'm talking to somebody from Japan afterwards she walked up and goes

[<a id="00-08-31">00:08:31</a>]  Japan Japan Japan Japan Japan because she doesn't speak English all that well

[<a id="00-08-36">00:08:36</a>]  well she only speak Greek and I guess Russian or something like that yeah and

[<a id="00-08-43">00:08:43</a>]  I got to know this kid and in the span of last I don't know for four years she

[<a id="00-08-49">00:08:49</a>]  became like a my kid you know grew up in refugee camp and there's nothing remotely

[<a id="00-08-59">00:08:59</a>]  feminine about her she's just obsessed with like toys and anime and stuff like

[<a id="00-09-04">00:09:04</a>]  that because I guess she didn't really grow up with a lot of stuff like that so

[<a id="00-09-09">00:09:09</a>]  yeah so I just buy stuff like that you know and you get I think this is

[<a id="00-09-14">00:09:14</a>]  probably true because you have two kids you just you know that story when I tell

[<a id="00-09-19">00:09:19</a>]  everyone I lost my friend's cat yeah and afterwards I all of a sudden noticing

[<a id="00-09-27">00:09:27</a>]  those help signs missing dogs and cats whatever I never noticed it before but

[<a id="00-09-33">00:09:33</a>]  once I went through losing the cat and I was just like panicking and looking for

[<a id="00-09-37">00:09:37</a>]  the cat all of a sudden I noticed all those signs now and I never had a kid

[<a id="00-09-42">00:09:42</a>]  obviously but not now that now that I've been seeing this kid make sure she's

[<a id="00-09-49">00:09:49</a>]  doing all right now I understand when you say things like yeah I'd like to go

[<a id="00-09-56">00:09:56</a>]  and do those shows but I gotta stay you know X number of days per week make sure

[<a id="00-10-02">00:10:02</a>]  my kids are all right now I kind of get it okay you know like I didn't understand

[<a id="00-10-09">00:10:09</a>]  what dimension does to people until my cousin was dealing with his mom my aunt I

[<a id="00-10-14">00:10:14</a>]  mean I understood intellectually but you don't have a really emotional connection

[<a id="00-10-19">00:10:19</a>]  to stuff like that you only have like I mean I don't want to make him I don't

[<a id="00-10-23">00:10:23</a>]  want to make a ridiculous comparison but watching sports games is nothing on this

[<a id="00-10-28">00:10:28</a>]  you know I have a little bit of money on it there's no stake in in the game right

[<a id="00-10-32">00:10:32</a>]  okay yeah I don't I understand dementia is a problem I have friends with problem

[<a id="00-10-38">00:10:38</a>]  but you really don't know until it's really close to you you know what I'm

[<a id="00-10-41">00:10:41</a>]  saying yeah so I think coming to Athens really change because I've been going to

[<a id="00-10-45">00:10:45</a>]  most like Northern Europe there's not a lot of nice people but it's weird man I

[<a id="00-10-51">00:10:51</a>]  don't know how to explain it everything south of Switzerland down people have a

[<a id="00-10-56">00:10:56</a>]  great personality and like the emotional stuff but their economy shit yeah and

[<a id="00-11-01">00:11:01</a>]  everything above is like economy is great great living standards whatnot but

[<a id="00-11-07">00:11:07</a>]  emotionally I don't know very reserved I'm sure they're nice people but you

[<a id="00-11-12">00:11:12</a>]  know what I'm saying they're not yeah outgoing you know and I found something

[<a id="00-11-17">00:11:17</a>]  I've never really had growing up I mean I don't have as this many people are

[<a id="00-11-22">00:11:22</a>]  happy to see me okay and then and they really changed me in a good way you know

[<a id="00-11-27">00:11:27</a>]  and very grateful because I gotta tell you 2019 was a really difficult time and

[<a id="00-11-33">00:11:33</a>]  they really helped me well I mean 2019 you know a couple things you know I mean

[<a id="00-11-42">00:11:42</a>]  I talked about it on the show I mean 2019 you know my friend Brody

[<a id="00-11-49">00:11:49</a>]  Steven and my friend Brandon iron Brad aka Brandon hurdle they killed themselves

[<a id="00-11-55">00:11:55</a>]  similar way my dad did it I also turned 50 so that's already like a really weird

[<a id="00-12-02">00:12:02</a>]  you know you processing like what does this mean you know yeah and I think I

[<a id="00-12-07">00:12:07</a>]  was having pretty rough time processing whole thing and I think I don't think I

[<a id="00-12-17">00:12:17</a>]  was in a good place I think that suicide two in a row really kind of shocked me

[<a id="00-12-22">00:12:22</a>]  you know because when my dad assuming they was suicide within a month my

[<a id="00-12-29">00:12:29</a>]  cousin did killed himself too you know so I had to deal with to suicide that

[<a id="00-12-34">00:12:34</a>]  2003 then 16 years later I had to deal with both and I turned 50 and things

[<a id="00-12-42">00:12:42</a>]  were not looking great you know luckily I know it's very strange to say but

[<a id="00-12-47">00:12:47</a>]  COVID started that really actually kind of helped I think yeah because my friend

[<a id="00-12-51">00:12:51</a>]  Stan Chan and Karen Chan they were kind enough I was ready to leave Phoenix

[<a id="00-12-55">00:12:55</a>]  beginning of COVID ready to go to New York and they just said why don't you

[<a id="00-13-00">00:13:00</a>]  stay here and they let me stay with him for four months so at that point I think

[<a id="00-13-06">00:13:06</a>]  that was like the first time in like a year or two where I actually had a place

[<a id="00-13-09">00:13:09</a>]  to stay straight that was the first time I think in 20 years I actually had a

[<a id="00-13-16">00:13:16</a>]  whole building to myself and nobody come over interfere with me you know so I

[<a id="00-13-22">00:13:22</a>]  think that really helped me a lot and I think I mean just sleeping in your own

[<a id="00-13-28">00:13:28</a>]  bed yeah cuz you know I haven't had like full-time job until 2012 so I'm

[<a id="00-13-38">00:13:38</a>]  couchsurfing or I'm going to friends places whatnot and actually having a

[<a id="00-13-44">00:13:44</a>]  really nice building because they have a house small house behind the house main

[<a id="00-13-50">00:13:50</a>]  house so I was able to kind of recover you know I think that really helped and

[<a id="00-13-54">00:13:54</a>]  then when I finally left July of 2020 man I did some tons of travels there

[<a id="00-14-03">00:14:03</a>]  was unimaginable you know because when I was traveling 2020 summer of I think a

[<a id="00-14-10">00:14:10</a>]  lot of people still so afraid that's that's when I see a bargain that's like

[<a id="00-14-16">00:14:16</a>]  that's I always love when there's a plane crash I mean it's not cool for the

[<a id="00-14-19">00:14:19</a>]  people that got killed but I always go to the airlines it's not trying to see

[<a id="00-14-23">00:14:23</a>]  cheap tickets right away because the prices dropped like tremendously you

[<a id="00-14-28">00:14:28</a>]  know so it makes sense it makes sense I mean also well I mean whenever there's a

[<a id="00-14-34">00:14:34</a>]  bloodbath in Wall Street that's the time to buy right yeah you don't let panic

[<a id="00-14-39">00:14:39</a>]  grabs grab you never use it never Winston Churchill never miss out on a

[<a id="00-14-45">00:14:45</a>]  good crisis or something and I think JP Morgan even had it you know that the

[<a id="00-14-50">00:14:50</a>]  Wall Street bloodbath is actually a buying opportunity yeah but people panic

[<a id="00-14-55">00:14:55</a>]  you know so yeah going to Athens it I got close with them because you know I

[<a id="00-15-09">00:15:09</a>]  do that joke about going to those brothels you pick a girl do you like

[<a id="00-15-17">00:15:17</a>]  she's busy so you got to stay in your room waiting your turn and quite often

[<a id="00-15-22">00:15:22</a>]  they have TV monitor and you're playing porn and this particular time you're

[<a id="00-15-27">00:15:27</a>]  playing porn - I I work plan do you remember what the title was I think it

[<a id="00-15-34">00:15:34</a>]  might have been like service animal I don't know which number it was but my

[<a id="00-15-37">00:15:37</a>]  friend Brandon was in it you know I think it was Brandon no it was Brandon

[<a id="00-15-42">00:15:42</a>]  I think it was service animal by Joyce Rivera and you know that's first time I

[<a id="00-15-48">00:15:48</a>]  saw him perform in porn since he killed himself you know so I mean I could count

[<a id="00-15-59">00:15:59</a>]  last what 21 years I think I only cry like two times two or three times the

[<a id="00-16-11">00:16:11</a>]  Richie Toohey story brothel with Brandon and when my dad passed away I think so

[<a id="00-16-18">00:16:18</a>]  I'm not to make fun of that but then which is fine this woman comes back and

[<a id="00-16-25">00:16:25</a>]  you're the first person I've seen who's who's crying because of porn video did

[<a id="00-16-32">00:16:32</a>]  you did you explain it I explained to her and it's it's sad because two times

[<a id="00-16-49">00:16:49</a>]  where I was supposed to meet her in in Frankfurt and the last time I saw her

[<a id="00-16-55">00:16:55</a>]  was December 2021 three years ago we were supposed to travel across Europe

[<a id="00-17-06">00:17:06</a>]  back to her home in Modova but she couldn't leave her facility because

[<a id="00-17-13">00:17:13</a>]  somebody in the factory in Germany tested positive for kovat so she couldn't

[<a id="00-17-20">00:17:20</a>]  leave and I'm not even supposed to go into that town but I fucking sneaked in

[<a id="00-17-25">00:17:25</a>]  middle of the night and she's sneaking out of that house she's not supposed to

[<a id="00-17-28">00:17:28</a>]  so I saw her for maybe half an hour I didn't realize that was gonna be the

[<a id="00-17-33">00:17:33</a>]  last time I'm gonna see her you know and I haven't seen her but just let's touch

[<a id="00-17-41">00:17:41</a>]  something happened either either if I have to make a guess maybe either her or

[<a id="00-17-50">00:17:50</a>]  her family told her that that it's not a good idea to be somebody old even though

[<a id="00-17-56">00:17:56</a>]  she likes me whatever maybe she found a marriage proposal or something like that

[<a id="00-18-01">00:18:01</a>]  I just want to make sure she's alright you know but I didn't realize that was

[<a id="00-18-06">00:18:06</a>]  last time I saw her and it was crazy because we I sneak in that town and this

[<a id="00-18-16">00:18:16</a>]  town is so isolated close to the Dutch border when you buy a ticket from the

[<a id="00-18-20">00:18:20</a>]  train station they usually give English option didn't even have English option

[<a id="00-18-24">00:18:24</a>]  in Germany well yeah and saw her I'm glad I got to sell her and when I left I

[<a id="00-18-32">00:18:32</a>]  had a fucking headphones on was it too close

[<a id="00-18-35">00:18:35</a>]  that's right there and I wasn't paying attention and I was kind of walking

[<a id="00-18-45">00:18:45</a>]  through that the area where you stand for one train I was kind of fucking

[<a id="00-18-52">00:18:52</a>]  around cuz I'm getting on the floor because it's it's in the rural area you

[<a id="00-18-56">00:18:56</a>]  know and I didn't realize how close soon as I got out down and I got up five

[<a id="00-19-01">00:19:01</a>]  second letter train passed by I could have got hit by a train I wasn't in pay

[<a id="00-19-05">00:19:05</a>]  attention you know yeah but then yeah she comforted me you know she come from

[<a id="00-19-12">00:19:12</a>]  poor country she was a sex worker she doesn't do anymore I don't think I'm

[<a id="00-19-17">00:19:17</a>]  gonna get to see her ever again but the old lady who was her madam I still see

[<a id="00-19-22">00:19:22</a>]  her you know it was really nice to get to know them and I like I like seeing

[<a id="00-19-29">00:19:29</a>]  those girls what little things I could buy for them you know because I grew up

[<a id="00-19-34">00:19:34</a>]  in like area where there's a lot of like sex workers or people who practice what

[<a id="00-19-41">00:19:41</a>]  expert called survival sex they're so poor sometimes they have to give sex to

[<a id="00-19-47">00:19:47</a>]  survive you know so I grow up people like that these are for for a meal a meal or

[<a id="00-19-52">00:19:52</a>]  pay rent or some whatever you know it's desperate and it's very very common then

[<a id="00-19-58">00:19:58</a>]  people really realize you know and so these are the people that grow up and you

[<a id="00-20-05">00:20:05</a>]  would think they're bitter and mean but it's amazing how they're still able to

[<a id="00-20-08">00:20:08</a>]  see good good in people you know because I thought if you're a woman working that

[<a id="00-20-14">00:20:14</a>]  business because sometimes you have to deal with like terrible male customers

[<a id="00-20-19">00:20:19</a>]  that they would hate milk men in general I definitely think that way and I'm not a

[<a id="00-20-26">00:20:26</a>]  sex worker but quite often it's like they think 60% of men are good that's way

[<a id="00-20-33">00:20:33</a>]  higher than I thought it will be you know yeah I guess I mean look I guess a

[<a id="00-20-39">00:20:39</a>]  lot of people go like for like lack of human intimacy I mean in this like in

[<a id="00-20-45">00:20:45</a>]  this city I mean we're we're just basically at the end of the red light

[<a id="00-20-49">00:20:49</a>]  street here and you mean like red light district yeah the long shot so just up

[<a id="00-20-57">00:20:57</a>]  it's just pretty close to it yeah and I mean it's a really pushing the I mean I

[<a id="00-21-04">00:21:04</a>]  know there's people street walker work there but it's a very very lower case

[<a id="00-21-08">00:21:08</a>]  yeah red light district it's not it's not like Hamburg or you know

[<a id="00-21-13">00:21:13</a>]  Frankfurt or something or Amsterdam yeah but but but yeah I mean I mean the

[<a id="00-21-19">00:21:19</a>]  correlation between that and a kind of lack of lack of human intimacy I forget

[<a id="00-21-24">00:21:24</a>]  where I get that from some documentary yeah some woman she's a sex worker and

[<a id="00-21-29">00:21:29</a>]  she's saying a lot of guys just come here to talk because nobody listens to

[<a id="00-21-33">00:21:33</a>]  yeah and yeah well I mean I think I don't want to make up a percentage but I

[<a id="00-21-41">00:21:41</a>]  think I hate this I hate saying the word words white men in Europe because

[<a id="00-21-50">00:21:50</a>]  that's a strange notion in my opinion because you guys don't think we're white

[<a id="00-21-55">00:21:55</a>]  man usually like I'm French or German things like that this is like a very

[<a id="00-21-59">00:21:59</a>]  North American concept but yeah white men in North America I think the biggest

[<a id="00-22-06">00:22:06</a>]  percentage of people suffering from depression suicide is like there it is

[<a id="00-22-10">00:22:10</a>]  a white man in general you know it's very high suicide yeah so it's I mean

[<a id="00-22-20">00:22:20</a>]  this is like a tangent but this is one of the things watching Patrice O'Neill

[<a id="00-22-27">00:22:27</a>]  he's talking about at some point he was trying to do a show to understand white

[<a id="00-22-31">00:22:31</a>]  people yeah and it's this famous bit of his you find on YouTube of of why white

[<a id="00-22-39">00:22:39</a>]  people love Radiohead and this song like I'm a creep I'm a loser and where he's

[<a id="00-22-45">00:22:45</a>]  kind of like like I didn't own slaves but I feel terrible and it isn't it's a

[<a id="00-22-52">00:22:52</a>]  bizarre thing it's it's yeah it's it's it's this there's some everyone I'm not

[<a id="00-23-02">00:23:02</a>]  gonna start saying unprocessed trauma again but there's something there's

[<a id="00-23-07">00:23:07</a>]  something in this this European and I don't think Russians have this as much I

[<a id="00-23-14">00:23:14</a>]  think it's like like people that have this why why would why would they I mean

[<a id="00-23-19">00:23:19</a>]  they're slobs that literally mean slaves true and and and and the fact that one

[<a id="00-23-25">00:23:25</a>]  thing to treat because last time I saw him that was the first and last time I

[<a id="00-23-28">00:23:28</a>]  got an argument with him like he's very very funny but doesn't mean he's right

[<a id="00-23-33">00:23:33</a>]  about everything and - look this whole idea that trip Patrice being pimp it's

[<a id="00-23-43">00:23:43</a>]  not a pimp because if he was he wouldn't pay for six like losers like myself you

[<a id="00-23-48">00:23:48</a>]  know what I mean he's a big funny guy he was very eloquent but lack in self

[<a id="00-23-54">00:23:54</a>]  reflection right like why don't you stop blaming white people the problems look

[<a id="00-23-57">00:23:57</a>]  at yourself in the mirror there is a lot of problem within black community that

[<a id="00-24-00">00:24:00</a>]  they're just not capable of self reflect you know and how do I know that talk to

[<a id="00-24-07">00:24:07</a>]  any Africans live in America they talk shit about black people in America you

[<a id="00-24-10">00:24:10</a>]  know yeah and I got into that and no matter how much you say Asians were rude

[<a id="00-24-16">00:24:16</a>]  to him but like well what's worse worse like Asians being discriminatory against

[<a id="00-24-23">00:24:23</a>]  blacks or when blacks killed other black people that's even worse in my opinion

[<a id="00-24-27">00:24:27</a>]  you know yeah we got a big argument and sad that that was the first and last time

[<a id="00-24-31">00:24:31</a>]  I worked with him and he is great don't get me wrong but even he admitted to his

[<a id="00-24-37">00:24:37</a>]  manager at the time like why was so difficult working with the system you

[<a id="00-24-40">00:24:40</a>]  know I think at the tail end of it he kind of realized maybe he shouldn't have

[<a id="00-24-44">00:24:44</a>]  been so hard that he could have got stuff out of the so-called system that he

[<a id="00-24-49">00:24:49</a>]  dislike but it was too late by the time he realized that he was dead you know

[<a id="00-24-53">00:24:53</a>]  yeah it's a I mean it's so funny I mean I mean I mean in general this is a thing

[<a id="00-25-01">00:25:01</a>]  of like me as a young man if I think about that yeah absolute about principles

[<a id="00-25-08">00:25:08</a>]  or whatever and then and then and it's like if I do whatever the stuff you do

[<a id="00-25-16">00:25:16</a>]  to live your life yeah you know kiss your boss's ass because you need the

[<a id="00-25-21">00:25:21</a>]  money that you're that you're selling out somehow but but on the other hand

[<a id="00-25-27">00:25:27</a>]  like like when you get over that unless your name is Jesus Christ most people

[<a id="00-25-31">00:25:31</a>]  sell out I'm sorry you know yeah but believe me but also you know like like

[<a id="00-25-38">00:25:38</a>]  but but in to all its intents and purposes Jesus is like a fictional dude

[<a id="00-25-47">00:25:47</a>]  yes okay that is made up because the thing is is like is like this does when

[<a id="00-25-55">00:25:55</a>]  you learn to play the game yeah way you can play it in a way because it's a game

[<a id="00-26-01">00:26:01</a>]  the whole social construct whatever I hope we do podcast in January 14th what's

[<a id="00-26-06">00:26:06</a>]  happening January 14 it's hundred 100 universe 100 year anniversary of a guy

[<a id="00-26-11">00:26:11</a>]  named Yukio Mishima he's a great Japanese author Oh Mishima Yukio he

[<a id="00-26-17">00:26:17</a>]  turned 100 years that day and in November 25th of 1970 maybe I might be

[<a id="00-26-25">00:26:25</a>]  wrong by the year by you one year or a couple days yeah he can't commit a

[<a id="00-26-30">00:26:30</a>]  ritual suicide because he thought Japan was corrupt oh the general nice not a

[<a id="00-26-35">00:26:35</a>]  general he was a literary writer oh this wasn't the guy that took the

[<a id="00-26-39">00:26:39</a>]  government yeah and he he didn't compromise about that stuff you know and

[<a id="00-26-46">00:26:46</a>]  yeah I mean it's true like yeah I mean it's a there are people really serious

[<a id="00-26-54">00:26:54</a>]  about this kind of shit you know I absolutely yeah we call them crazy but

[<a id="00-26-59">00:26:59</a>]  like is it really that crazy when they really believe in something that

[<a id="00-27-02">00:27:02</a>]  principle you know just because we don't believe in anything well yeah I mean

[<a id="00-27-09">00:27:09</a>]  this discussion yeah I think but to me to me the thing is the moment I hear

[<a id="00-27-14">00:27:14</a>]  somebody say I believe this yeah I'm like yeah that means you've switched off

[<a id="00-27-19">00:27:19</a>]  your brain yeah because because questioning things is to me the religion

[<a id="00-27-26">00:27:26</a>]  it's like it's like somebody says believe in yeah I believe yeah the

[<a id="00-27-31">00:27:31</a>]  moment basically anytime somebody says I believe in X it's followed by now I'm

[<a id="00-27-36">00:27:36</a>]  gonna oppress some other motherfuckers who don't believe my shit and and yeah

[<a id="00-27-43">00:27:43</a>]  anyway I'm getting off track so apropos apropos dudes with absolute

[<a id="00-27-50">00:27:50</a>]  perspectives on life you just came back from Mars and that wasn't a very good

[<a id="00-27-54">00:27:54</a>]  segue but okay I went I went to Athens I took care of all those people then

[<a id="00-28-01">00:28:01</a>]  afterwards I went to Milan for three days and because I was taking that

[<a id="00-28-07">00:28:07</a>]  little kid Nelly for her 30th birthday and that idiot told me she's she could

[<a id="00-28-13">00:28:13</a>]  travel and of course when I get there oh I problem with my passport so I I paid

[<a id="00-28-21">00:28:21</a>]  for that trip already I didn't need to go to Milan I didn't have to stay in

[<a id="00-28-25">00:28:25</a>]  fancy place and of course I paid 140 bucks thinking like I'm gonna spend the

[<a id="00-28-30">00:28:30</a>]  whole time with her to fly up here which I didn't have to do I could have left

[<a id="00-28-33">00:28:33</a>]  earlier so the whole trip you know I don't know five six hundred bucks for no

[<a id="00-28-38">00:28:38</a>]  reason I mean it was nice it's nice place you know but flaky bitches man

[<a id="00-28-43">00:28:43</a>]  that's just coming up for like gate for ten people wasn't planned part of the

[<a id="00-28-48">00:28:48</a>]  plan but anyway so I was in Milan I went late Como like oh I get it now why

[<a id="00-28-54">00:28:54</a>]  there's so many rich people live up here yeah then I got back here for like a day

[<a id="00-28-59">00:28:59</a>]  that a show was great I enjoyed a lot I was wrong I wasn't really particularly

[<a id="00-29-05">00:29:05</a>]  keen to do a show at the front room I was wrong it was it turned out to be a

[<a id="00-29-09">00:29:09</a>]  really good room it's a good to a point where even the bartender was listening

[<a id="00-29-13">00:29:13</a>]  to the whole show you know yeah and the next day next I went the knees I did

[<a id="00-29-23">00:29:23</a>]  blah blah okay although although let's let's let's briefly tell it because I

[<a id="00-29-29">00:29:29</a>]  picked you up with my son in the airport yesterday three in the morning this morning

[<a id="00-29-34">00:29:34</a>]  yeah me and my son zombies you are psyched you know what's funny is that

[<a id="00-29-42">00:29:42</a>]  after after we drop you off my son said to me so you know the conversation I was

[<a id="00-29-46">00:29:46</a>]  expecting would have been like yeah I had a good journey yeah but instead he's

[<a id="00-29-51">00:29:51</a>]  like yeah there were a lot of rapists and and but okay we're getting to it but to

[<a id="00-30-00">00:30:00</a>]  me the fascinating can I do some there were a lot of rapists and and so let's

[<a id="00-30-04">00:30:04</a>]  get into this but what was fascinating to me is how psyched you were like you

[<a id="00-30-09">00:30:09</a>]  would there was something it was like it was like a boy that just opened a

[<a id="00-30-15">00:30:15</a>]  present at Christmas I mean I I don't know how I don't know how to process

[<a id="00-30-22">00:30:22</a>]  this whole thing can you hold on for second I'll be

[<a id="00-30-25">00:30:25</a>]  second second we take let's take a quick timeout can you do that I actually I

[<a id="00-30-30">00:30:30</a>]  don't know how to fucking do that so we'll just keep rolling

[<a id="00-30-45">00:30:45</a>]  alright so are we back on yeah yeah I just let it roll okay so I'm not sick

[<a id="00-31-04">00:31:04</a>]  but you know sometimes you have that feeling like little before you get sick

[<a id="00-31-09">00:31:09</a>]  you kind of feel in your throat I had a little bit of that but I didn't go

[<a id="00-31-14">00:31:14</a>]  through any sort of sickness and I could I could feel it in my throat like I've

[<a id="00-31-19">00:31:19</a>]  already gone through the recovery thing so like it's like a day before that come

[<a id="00-31-22">00:31:22</a>]  back okay so it's kind of time is great because I'll be here for a couple days

[<a id="00-31-26">00:31:26</a>]  you know so you caught you caught rape from these guys basically I think I was

[<a id="00-31-32">00:31:32</a>]  a little like scratchy already okay so you so you get in these you take a blah

[<a id="00-31-37">00:31:37</a>]  blah car well let's just so you well let's first let's first so you take this

[<a id="00-31-43">00:31:43</a>]  car from me she with a dude who's the dude you've taken down to it mother

[<a id="00-31-47">00:31:47</a>]  taking you down there well first of all I'm little better background why I went

[<a id="00-31-52">00:31:52</a>]  to France right France right so is it Mazan or Muzan I will no idea I just so

[<a id="00-32-03">00:32:03</a>]  Mazan and Muzan friend Muzan friends Muzan there is a gentleman Dominique

[<a id="00-32-11">00:32:11</a>]  Pitico he got caught September September 2020 a small market little away from

[<a id="00-32-20">00:32:20</a>]  Muzan where he was cut taking picture of upskirt pictures of women he got in

[<a id="00-32-26">00:32:26</a>]  trouble for that in fact he also got in trouble like in 2010 in Paris he had to

[<a id="00-32-32">00:32:32</a>]  pay like hundred euros that's good he got caught doing the same thing and you

[<a id="00-32-37">00:32:37</a>]  would think you catching him a little bit of you know slapping the wrist and

[<a id="00-32-41">00:32:41</a>]  move but the police actually did a good job searching his cell phone and laptop

[<a id="00-32-46">00:32:46</a>]  in it they found unconscious women a bunch of people having sex with her and

[<a id="00-32-53">00:32:53</a>]  happened to be his wife Giselle Pitico and I remember reading about this late

[<a id="00-33-02">00:33:02</a>]  2020 and I think well I need any time and like any sort of like six crime I'm

[<a id="00-33-11">00:33:11</a>]  kind of curious reading about it but I think any time when a woman is knocked

[<a id="00-33-17">00:33:17</a>]  out by drugs or something it piqued my interest because will bail Cosby and and

[<a id="00-33-24">00:33:24</a>]  and there was a case in Japan early 2000 guy named Giorgio Bara who was probably

[<a id="00-33-32">00:33:32</a>]  raped up to 400 women by knocking them out with drugs you know so and I think

[<a id="00-33-39">00:33:39</a>]  month and a half two month ago when I was Japan I actually went to the cave

[<a id="00-33-43">00:33:43</a>]  when he ended up getting this young women named Lucy Blackman from England

[<a id="00-33-48">00:33:48</a>]  killed he chopped her up in pieces and buried in this cave which later police

[<a id="00-33-54">00:33:54</a>]  discovered and removed the body but I always want to go and show some respect

[<a id="00-33-57">00:33:57</a>]  you know and my dad and I tried to do it to your 2000 we just couldn't find it of

[<a id="00-34-03">00:34:03</a>]  course with the power of Google map and stuff I was able to find it I went there

[<a id="00-34-07">00:34:07</a>]  so anyway it just piqued my interest four years ago and I was following the

[<a id="00-34-14">00:34:14</a>]  case I wasn't really planning to go but I just realized like maybe a month ago

[<a id="00-34-19">00:34:19</a>]  like reading like kind of timing like oh I'm gonna be there when the trial is

[<a id="00-34-23">00:34:23</a>]  gonna ending so I thought what do I know I was trying to figure out could I go

[<a id="00-34-28">00:34:28</a>]  down there could I afford and man it was like five six hundred euro of course I

[<a id="00-34-34">00:34:34</a>]  find a way to get down there really with the cheap you know and which I did so I

[<a id="00-34-40">00:34:40</a>]  was able to make it happen you know and okay once-in-a-lifetime experience to

[<a id="00-34-47">00:34:47</a>]  seeing something like that you know so let's let's this tell them a little bit

[<a id="00-34-52">00:34:52</a>]  chronological order so you're right you landed knees but plane yeah I should

[<a id="00-34-56">00:34:56</a>]  have flown to Marseille but I had my geography all fucked up and also I think

[<a id="00-35-02">00:35:02</a>]  flying Denise was really cheap yeah and so somebody picks you up in that blah

[<a id="00-35-07">00:35:07</a>]  blah blah I have to leave the airport go to this guy's house and exactly at the

[<a id="00-35-14">00:35:14</a>]  time he say he's gonna show up he come down out of the apartment there was

[<a id="00-35-18">00:35:18</a>]  another lady waiting next to me I wasn't sure if she was standing there for some

[<a id="00-35-22">00:35:22</a>]  other right we both follow him like couple block on in the vehicle and we

[<a id="00-35-28">00:35:28</a>]  start traveling westbound to direction of young and I never done it I've done

[<a id="00-35-37">00:35:37</a>]  uber and stuff live but like sharing right to other people I've never done

[<a id="00-35-40">00:35:40</a>]  that and so and he knows you're going to more so yeah she didn't know that but so

[<a id="00-35-48">00:35:48</a>]  how did that come to say did you talk about it with them like why you you're

[<a id="00-35-54">00:35:54</a>]  going there and why in the conversation just jump into by the way you know you

[<a id="00-35-58">00:35:58</a>]  know this thing blah blah it's really interesting because when you hear blah

[<a id="00-36-02">00:36:02</a>]  blah it sounds like budget givers stupid talk yeah it's completely opposite the

[<a id="00-36-06">00:36:06</a>]  boat twice I used it it was a really sweet meaningful and sometimes sad

[<a id="00-36-10">00:36:10</a>]  conversations you know I really enjoyed it yeah I think you're really paying for

[<a id="00-36-16">00:36:16</a>]  you it's almost like a prostitution yes you're paying for transportation but

[<a id="00-36-20">00:36:20</a>]  what you really paying for it is like short span of time having kind of

[<a id="00-36-25">00:36:25</a>]  meaningful connection with somebody you know and with no need for further

[<a id="00-36-30">00:36:30</a>]  commitment but they became kind of friends you know the lady spoke way

[<a id="00-36-37">00:36:37</a>]  better English because she her mom is American and she's have French and she's

[<a id="00-36-43">00:36:43</a>]  cut interest in true crime so everybody told reasons why they're leaving like

[<a id="00-36-47">00:36:47</a>]  that guy have to visit his family westbound she need to go see her husband

[<a id="00-36-51">00:36:51</a>]  and I think within an hour they pick up another guy who is a sports writer so I

[<a id="00-36-56">00:36:56</a>]  ended up talking for like 40 minutes before we dropped him off at the airport it

[<a id="00-37-00">00:37:00</a>]  was a really wonderful conversation but she was saying like oh yeah I follow

[<a id="00-37-04">00:37:04</a>]  that case and she was really interested I think I think they were all interested

[<a id="00-37-08">00:37:08</a>]  you know and that was a really fun conversation that I didn't expect that

[<a id="00-37-13">00:37:13</a>]  this is all accident because if I would have gone to Marseille I would have done

[<a id="00-37-17">00:37:17</a>]  public transportation straight out beyond no country you know and I this is

[<a id="00-37-24">00:37:24</a>]  my favorite part of traveling you know serendipity some unexpected thing

[<a id="00-37-30">00:37:30</a>]  happened that you didn't anticipate and and I don't know if you know that word

[<a id="00-37-36">00:37:36</a>]  serendipity comes from three Persian Prince name serendip where these three

[<a id="00-37-43">00:37:43</a>]  brothers or two brothers are traveling and they all this fantastical things

[<a id="00-37-47">00:37:47</a>]  happen hence the word serendipity you know okay so this is a wonderful part of

[<a id="00-37-51">00:37:51</a>]  travel so it's very much like very magical in a way you know yeah so that

[<a id="00-37-56">00:37:56</a>]  was great because last night when I get it right back

[<a id="00-38-00">00:38:00</a>]  Dominique he is executive at Airbus he sells helicopter and it's really

[<a id="00-38-09">00:38:09</a>]  interesting he was telling me all the business side of helicopter I didn't know

[<a id="00-38-12">00:38:12</a>]  anything about but there he had a daughter in the backseat very sweet girl

[<a id="00-38-16">00:38:16</a>]  she looked way younger than when he told me she was eight I guess I didn't really

[<a id="00-38-21">00:38:21</a>]  look at her carefully young girl she was well well behaved but yeah well she

[<a id="00-38-27">00:38:27</a>]  doesn't speak English so when he was talking to me she didn't know what we

[<a id="00-38-32">00:38:32</a>]  were talking about maybe a little bit but basically was saying like when he

[<a id="00-38-36">00:38:36</a>]  was living in Mexico City working for Airbus

[<a id="00-38-42">00:38:42</a>]  make his wife they got married they've moved to Europe and and then 2019 they

[<a id="00-38-48">00:38:48</a>]  flew back for vacation and something happened where his wife passed away so

[<a id="00-38-53">00:38:53</a>]  he's been taking care of the daughter and I don't know why it just kind of

[<a id="00-38-57">00:38:57</a>]  choked me up I didn't cry or anything but like it just made me sound like this

[<a id="00-39-00">00:39:00</a>]  little girl really didn't know her mom so I had one extra like a toy thing from

[<a id="00-39-04">00:39:04</a>]  Japan so I'll give it to her you know and that's why I always like buying all

[<a id="00-39-11">00:39:11</a>]  those stupid trinkets from Japan because in moments like that it's just nice to

[<a id="00-39-14">00:39:14</a>]  give shit away you know but I had a nice conversation and I fucked up I went to

[<a id="00-39-20">00:39:20</a>]  wrong pickup place he went out of his way to pick me up we had a conversation

[<a id="00-39-25">00:39:25</a>]  for like two and a half maybe three hours it was great then I was ready to

[<a id="00-39-30">00:39:30</a>]  stay at Airport and when he said okay my son and I will come and pick me up I

[<a id="00-39-34">00:39:34</a>]  didn't know he had a car which I did find out later he had a rental car and

[<a id="00-39-38">00:39:38</a>]  then it's really cool they did that for me because I'm used to that you know I

[<a id="00-39-42">00:39:42</a>]  was ready to sit there until like seven hours until you got up and meet up with

[<a id="00-39-46">00:39:46</a>]  you and get a key or whatever you know so that that was a great part of blah

[<a id="00-39-50">00:39:50</a>]  blah in and out of the place but when I finally made it to Avion I went to my

[<a id="00-40-03">00:40:03</a>]  Airbnb slept I think I slept from midnight until 4 a.m. on the sentencing

[<a id="00-40-10">00:40:10</a>]  day I got up early I went over there because I don't know how the system

[<a id="00-40-14">00:40:14</a>]  worked see in New York obviously you know how the case trust him I've been

[<a id="00-40-19">00:40:19</a>]  you're not more than no it's an Avion Mozart is so small you went you went

[<a id="00-40-25">00:40:25</a>]  there too of course I have to go there okay we don't tell us a bit about Mozart

[<a id="00-40-29">00:40:29</a>]  festival like what like when you say small well I went to those places day

[<a id="00-40-34">00:40:34</a>]  after that but if you want to hear it first that the day after the sentencing

[<a id="00-40-42">00:40:42</a>]  I went to those places when you say those places like more than and

[<a id="00-40-51">00:40:51</a>]  surrounding towns I forgot the main town where Dominic petticoat was caught

[<a id="00-40-58">00:40:58</a>]  taking picture of upskirt I went to that department store so I walked around like

[<a id="00-41-03">00:41:03</a>]  half an hour like I just put in myself in his shoes like okay he got caught but

[<a id="00-41-11">00:41:11</a>]  I'm sure that wasn't the first time he did it there he finally got caught while

[<a id="00-41-15">00:41:15</a>]  he was doing that so I went to like produce sections the meat section or the

[<a id="00-41-22">00:41:22</a>]  grocery store but the store is so big they have like gardening equipment TV

[<a id="00-41-28">00:41:28</a>]  you know you have like a little bit of everything there it's a really nice

[<a id="00-41-31">00:41:31</a>]  place huh this French French supermarket sounds like yeah it has a dot and I'll

[<a id="00-41-42">00:41:42</a>]  show you so I went there I walked around and what I thought was ironic as I'm

[<a id="00-41-49">00:41:49</a>]  walking through the store you know how then when you go by the cashiers they

[<a id="00-41-52">00:41:52</a>]  have all the stupid magazine newspaper people haven't stupid affairs or yeah

[<a id="00-41-58">00:41:58</a>]  did she have this aliens baby whatever they had the main newspaper showing his

[<a id="00-42-06">00:42:06</a>]  wife on the cover like the verdict and whatever I thought was so ironic because

[<a id="00-42-10">00:42:10</a>]  this is where he got caught that started the whole thing and I think a lot of

[<a id="00-42-15">00:42:15</a>]  people don't read so they're not really well aware like this is the place that

[<a id="00-42-19">00:42:19</a>]  really changed French history in a way because I don't think we understand

[<a id="00-42-24">00:42:24</a>]  reverberation of what this court case gonna do for rest of the French society

[<a id="00-42-28">00:42:28</a>]  you know what I mean they're gonna change laws and stuff because oh it's on

[<a id="00-42-34">00:42:34</a>]  my other phone so so I walked around like I thought I kind of figured out

[<a id="00-42-42">00:42:42</a>]  where he probably did it because what there's a second level so they have like

[<a id="00-42-47">00:42:47</a>]  a kind of the slope elevator kind of thing where you could put your cart so I

[<a id="00-42-52">00:42:52</a>]  bet I bet when he was standing behind a lady he probably took a picture whatever

[<a id="00-42-56">00:42:56</a>]  right so I'm walking the place trying to figure out how he did it you know just

[<a id="00-43-02">00:43:02</a>]  like when I went to Minneapolis like where George Floyd got killed I lay

[<a id="00-43-07">00:43:07</a>]  flat exactly we got choked and then I kind of imagine how that feels like then

[<a id="00-43-12">00:43:12</a>]  I got on top like I was a cop choking him some black lady yelled at me I wasn't I

[<a id="00-43-17">00:43:17</a>]  wasn't making fun I wasn't making fun I was just to imagine like what was

[<a id="00-43-21">00:43:21</a>]  thinking you know or when Michael Brown got killed in Ferguson I went to the

[<a id="00-43-25">00:43:25</a>]  very spot we got shot where the grocery store he went in that shoplifting and

[<a id="00-43-30">00:43:30</a>]  things like that or Brianna Brown when she was murdered in the apartment second

[<a id="00-43-35">00:43:35</a>]  floor and things like that because I want to I want to go to those places

[<a id="00-43-43">00:43:43</a>]  it's I don't know somebody saying like you know people do war reenactment I do

[<a id="00-43-49">00:43:49</a>]  like crime reenactment or sex crime reenactment you know I go and kind of

[<a id="00-43-54">00:43:54</a>]  check out thinking behind it and I know some people think this is crazy or

[<a id="00-43-59">00:43:59</a>]  ridiculous but I I mean how else are you gonna try to minimize something like

[<a id="00-44-03">00:44:03</a>]  this from happening if you don't understand why they did it and why they

[<a id="00-44-07">00:44:07</a>]  specifically paid certain victims you know this is a this this woman that

[<a id="00-44-12">00:44:12</a>]  really admire and Burgess who is the professor of Boston University she saw

[<a id="00-44-17">00:44:17</a>]  she was one of the Quintico's behavioral science unit person right yeah in fact

[<a id="00-44-23">00:44:23</a>]  if you watch mind hunter the main female characters based on and Burgess you know

[<a id="00-44-27">00:44:27</a>]  so so I go to those places and like what happened and when I went to Muzan after

[<a id="00-44-37">00:44:37</a>]  that supermarket because I have to take another bus because it's away from that

[<a id="00-44-41">00:44:41</a>]  even the mini town it's Muzan is so small it literally took me 50 minutes walk

[<a id="00-44-46">00:44:46</a>]  around the whole circle of town I walked through inside of it 15 like minutes

[<a id="00-44-52">00:44:52</a>]  Wow because a lot of these towns are shaped like circle I think because

[<a id="00-44-56">00:44:56</a>]  formerly they probably had a wall or something to protect the town yeah so

[<a id="00-45-01">00:45:01</a>]  it's small to think this lady gun raped by all these guys who probably live not

[<a id="00-45-10">00:45:10</a>]  too far from there possibly even a neighbor to think like when she go to

[<a id="00-45-14">00:45:14</a>]  grocery store she recognized some of them and they even like waved at her

[<a id="00-45-21">00:45:21</a>]  it's it's a little weird to think you know like for these guys to make

[<a id="00-45-26">00:45:26</a>]  argument that oh I think this was a fantasy and she was into it then how

[<a id="00-45-31">00:45:31</a>]  come when you saw her you don't say that oh my god I had a great time hopefully

[<a id="00-45-34">00:45:34</a>]  you had a great time too you know this whole fantasy thing that you would do

[<a id="00-45-38">00:45:38</a>]  with your wife whatever nobody ever did that they knew what they're doing was

[<a id="00-45-42">00:45:42</a>]  wrong they didn't give a shit you know it's I mean we can come to that this

[<a id="00-45-48">00:45:48</a>]  this the husband there was some website where they go men they have a chat room

[<a id="00-45-55">00:45:55</a>]  where they could discuss and I think some people even showed up and ended up

[<a id="00-46-02">00:46:02</a>]  now raping her but they were kind of shocked cuz I think they were curious

[<a id="00-46-05">00:46:05</a>]  maybe thought this was a joke and when they saw what they saw people did leave

[<a id="00-46-11">00:46:11</a>]  what's sad is these people never reported to the police you know I mean

[<a id="00-46-16">00:46:16</a>]  I think no one they kept their mouth shut this is amazing I think I did a

[<a id="00-46-19">00:46:19</a>]  little bit of intensive research yeah and read it comments yesterday so this

[<a id="00-46-24">00:46:24</a>]  is good never one of the things what I got about where he was doing this it was

[<a id="00-46-30">00:46:30</a>]  some forum where it was like he sold it as a fetish that she was into it somehow

[<a id="00-46-35">00:46:35</a>]  that's how he sold it and then and then the dudes that were on there of course

[<a id="00-46-42">00:46:42</a>]  they're ashamed to admit they're in this forum yeah they may they may by the way

[<a id="00-46-48">00:46:48</a>]  it is a fetish and if they have a concern of the lady it's not a problem

[<a id="00-46-52">00:46:52</a>]  yeah but but clearly they didn't have any this one yeah but presumably he

[<a id="00-47-00">00:47:00</a>]  convinced them that yeah like she she given consent but also and because one

[<a id="00-47-08">00:47:08</a>]  of the things that people were asking in this formula is like there were dudes in

[<a id="00-47-13">00:47:13</a>]  this forum that knew this was going on and did nothing yeah they didn't like

[<a id="00-47-18">00:47:18</a>]  participate but I would assume that basically because this is this is

[<a id="00-47-24">00:47:24</a>]  already an environment for people to kind of confess their sins about will be

[<a id="00-47-31">00:47:31</a>]  open about what they're what their fetches are that they it's not like you

[<a id="00-47-36">00:47:36</a>]  go from I don't know like I like fisting calm and then you say you go to the

[<a id="00-47-44">00:47:44</a>]  police station say hey I saw this conversation on I like fisting calm

[<a id="00-47-48">00:47:48</a>]  but first thing is not illegal though oh or whatever I'm just making out yeah yeah like I've yeah like I was on this

[<a id="00-47-56">00:47:56</a>]  website I've got an extremely strange fetish that's hard to explain calm you

[<a id="00-48-01">00:48:01</a>]  don't then go running to the police and say hey I saw maybe maybe this is not a

[<a id="00-48-05">00:48:05</a>]  symptom but the Penn State I think it's a Penn State they had a coach that was

[<a id="00-48-18">00:48:18</a>]  molesting underage kids oh yeah yeah and nobody said anything and one of the guys

[<a id="00-48-24">00:48:24</a>]  said like maybe he miss saw something you know and yeah I mean I mean that's

[<a id="00-48-32">00:48:32</a>]  a I mean it depends on the age of the people involved like like like for me

[<a id="00-48-39">00:48:39</a>]  now if I see something that fucked up going on and I can I can intervene on

[<a id="00-48-45">00:48:45</a>]  the street then I'm gonna do it but but you know when you're when you're like

[<a id="00-48-51">00:48:51</a>]  late teens early 20s yeah you don't have that that confidence to act necessarily

[<a id="00-49-00">00:49:00</a>]  yeah but okay all right anyway so just briefly described but yeah yes it's

[<a id="00-49-09">00:49:09</a>]  always difficult isn't it like even during like call of it I know we're

[<a id="00-49-14">00:49:14</a>]  getting off track yeah during call of it how many people turn against their

[<a id="00-49-21">00:49:21</a>]  friends and neighbors you know 100% yeah exactly it's just like but when I when I

[<a id="00-49-26">00:49:26</a>]  say this I'm saying I'm telling these people when they did that it's not that

[<a id="00-49-32">00:49:32</a>]  different to me during World War two in Europe how many of those people would

[<a id="00-49-36">00:49:36</a>]  have turned Jews in you know what I mean absolutely yeah they would they get

[<a id="00-49-39">00:49:39</a>]  offended by that but believe me I my position was it's never good to violate

[<a id="00-49-49">00:49:49</a>]  constitutional rights you know and and to say you can't question these things

[<a id="00-49-55">00:49:55</a>]  like I don't I don't agree with that shit at all and that the people who are

[<a id="00-49-59">00:49:59</a>]  acting terrible doing a bit they just wasn't we need to move on yeah like it's

[<a id="00-50-04">00:50:04</a>]  always easy for say people for people like that to say that because they were

[<a id="00-50-07">00:50:07</a>]  causing all kinds of fucking problems that's why they want to move on you know

[<a id="00-50-10">00:50:10</a>]  is that and I loathe that kind of people and let's go let's go back to Moore's

[<a id="00-50-16">00:50:16</a>]  and for a second yeah so so it's a tiny place yeah like you know roughly the

[<a id="00-50-21">00:50:21</a>]  population five thousand or less okay and so they're barely like maybe barely

[<a id="00-50-29">00:50:29</a>]  like ten businesses what so there's like a church there's a church in the center

[<a id="00-50-36">00:50:36</a>]  of the town which I walked by there is a couple of restaurants and post office

[<a id="00-50-42">00:50:42</a>]  maybe I mean it's so fucking small you just I can't believe how small it is for

[<a id="00-50-47">00:50:47</a>]  people to gather someplace moves on and they did this this lady you know maybe

[<a id="00-50-51">00:50:51</a>]  they're not from the town but they're not that far they travel I can imagine

[<a id="00-50-56">00:50:56</a>]  there's not a whole lot of parking spot and yeah this guy showed up and then it's

[<a id="00-51-04">00:51:04</a>]  anything you know and so you see some people wandering around them was I'm

[<a id="00-51-09">00:51:09</a>]  like yeah what like what are they are they just like oh it's another day no

[<a id="00-51-16">00:51:16</a>]  they're just quiet minding their own business because I think there's a

[<a id="00-51-21">00:51:21</a>]  fantastic movie just as I say this this movie called hot fuzz by I forgot this

[<a id="00-51-27">00:51:27</a>]  English comedian actor he did the Shaun of the Dead a funny zombie movie yeah

[<a id="00-51-33">00:51:33</a>]  this movie hot fuzz is set in this little town in northern England he's a

[<a id="00-51-38">00:51:38</a>]  super cop from London okay he thinks he's in the most boring place in the

[<a id="00-51-43">00:51:43</a>]  world and then it turns out that the elders running the village of this like

[<a id="00-51-49">00:51:49</a>]  like Illuminati cult who are murdering people I say having orgy I haven't seen

[<a id="00-51-54">00:51:54</a>]  it but it's a hilarious movie but it actually it makes me think of this is

[<a id="00-51-58">00:51:58</a>]  like like I grew up in a small town like that yeah it's happening that boring as

[<a id="00-52-03">00:52:03</a>]  fuck it's a beautiful place but it's so crazy to think there's such a beautiful

[<a id="00-52-09">00:52:09</a>]  little town with a little creek it's clean they have a like these little

[<a id="00-52-14">00:52:14</a>]  boutique shops to think in that town this is the same little town where

[<a id="00-52-18">00:52:18</a>]  carrot nightly got married ten eleven years ago who where who carrot nightly

[<a id="00-52-23">00:52:23</a>]  Oh Karen nightly yeah she got married there around the time she got married is

[<a id="00-52-28">00:52:28</a>]  around the time when Dominic star raping his wife I'm not saying they are

[<a id="00-52-31">00:52:31</a>]  connected each other anyway what why did you know why she chose to get married

[<a id="00-52-36">00:52:36</a>]  I think her husband's family is my bad part I think something has something

[<a id="00-52-40">00:52:40</a>]  like that there's like 10 11 people at the wedding but I think her husband's

[<a id="00-52-45">00:52:45</a>]  family from that area you're hitting me in my conspiracies theories because all

[<a id="00-52-53">00:52:53</a>]  right I just number one it's I think most of the fucked up sexual shit the

[<a id="00-52-59">00:52:59</a>]  Western people do a lot of it a lot of it in the modern form originated in

[<a id="00-53-04">00:53:04</a>]  France like there's a lot of fucking perverts and I'm not a conspiracy guy so

[<a id="00-53-09">00:53:09</a>]  I don't I don't know any of it and well the other thing is is look at look at the

[<a id="00-53-14">00:53:14</a>]  whole look at look at the diddy scenario yeah now the undercurrent of that is you

[<a id="00-53-22">00:53:22</a>]  don't get to be a worldwide Hollywood superstar unless you went through some

[<a id="00-53-28">00:53:28</a>]  of that shit and I beg you if we look into Karen on this story there's some

[<a id="00-53-32">00:53:32</a>]  shit there and that she happens to marry a dude from a town where fucking

[<a id="00-53-39">00:53:39</a>]  everyone's a rapist it's like it's one of these kind of withers smokers I don't

[<a id="00-53-44">00:53:44</a>]  think there's anything related maybe no maybe no but it's just I only brought up

[<a id="00-53-49">00:53:49</a>]  because that's the only thing I know about that a place that she got married

[<a id="00-53-54">00:53:54</a>]  there just like a beyond is very famous for the French first or one of the

[<a id="00-53-58">00:53:58</a>]  performance thing once a year there it's a famous one in France but every time I

[<a id="00-54-03">00:54:03</a>]  think about beyond now nothing is going to be more dramatic than rape case and

[<a id="00-54-07">00:54:07</a>]  you know those you know those French crazy performance arts whatever I mean

[<a id="00-54-12">00:54:12</a>]  it must at least be crazy looking at the wedding photos now what did what did the

[<a id="00-54-19">00:54:19</a>]  Dominique what was his job wait but but the reason I brought her name also

[<a id="00-54-25">00:54:25</a>]  because I was finished watching the her show on Netflix right now black dopes

[<a id="00-54-29">00:54:29</a>]  which was great I literally finished watching the laughs episode when I was

[<a id="00-54-33">00:54:33</a>]  there because I was taking all that train to the area buses to my son and

[<a id="00-54-38">00:54:38</a>]  things like that but yeah that's how my brain works like only thing I know at

[<a id="00-54-42">00:54:42</a>]  this place is that she got married there and they just happen to be watching their

[<a id="00-54-46">00:54:46</a>]  shows and these little fucking town where you see commercials promoting

[<a id="00-54-52">00:54:52</a>]  French tourism was on look like one of the perfect place for that to think for

[<a id="00-54-57">00:54:57</a>]  ten years there's this massive rape shit was going on it's just like and it's

[<a id="00-55-02">00:55:02</a>]  crazy I mean I just for me it'd be funny if he not only was taking up the pictures

[<a id="00-55-08">00:55:08</a>]  but he was also a wedding photographer that will be that will be very funny

[<a id="00-55-14">00:55:14</a>]  well it says what electrician or something and then I think she worked

[<a id="00-55-19">00:55:19</a>]  for like something to do with logistic however they were retired which is it

[<a id="00-55-23">00:55:23</a>]  which is another funny they got married got divorced because there's a marital

[<a id="00-55-27">00:55:27</a>]  problem but they stayed divorced for seven eight years because tax reason or

[<a id="00-55-31">00:55:31</a>]  something and they got remarried you know and but the bit that I can't get

[<a id="00-55-36">00:55:36</a>]  over and maybe I'm just like too simple in the head is is the whole thing of him

[<a id="00-55-43">00:55:43</a>]  inviting dudes ran to rape her yeah began she was 61 yeah now to me like if

[<a id="00-55-51">00:55:51</a>]  you can find in a small town if you can find two people that want to fuck an

[<a id="00-56-00">00:56:00</a>]  unconscious old woman well old like retired woman then okay I could kind of

[<a id="00-56-08">00:56:08</a>]  understand that but that you can find 50 dudes because it's 80 it's not like this

[<a id="00-56-13">00:56:13</a>]  is this is not like a it's yeah it's like it's like fucking your grandmother or

[<a id="00-56-20">00:56:20</a>]  something it's like what yeah but people are into that yeah as some percentage

[<a id="00-56-26">00:56:26</a>]  but like like as you know there's five to six seven how many billions people

[<a id="00-56-30">00:56:30</a>]  that's that's enough pools of people where yeah but it happens that there's a

[<a id="00-56-35">00:56:35</a>]  massive cluster of them yeah in this tiny town I mean maybe maybe you look

[<a id="00-56-41">00:56:41</a>]  just overlooking the part that maybe she's older lady but she I mean I thought

[<a id="00-56-45">00:56:45</a>]  for somebody who's in 70 she I thought she was a very attractive and dignified

[<a id="00-56-50">00:56:50</a>]  you know but I don't think it's even even that just I idea of this violating

[<a id="00-56-56">00:56:56</a>]  somebody you know it's a turnoff for somebody kind of a power or I don't know

[<a id="00-57-01">00:57:01</a>]  there's some people just into that I mean so maybe we just fucking the warning and

[<a id="00-57-06">00:57:06</a>]  they did it but it was like over 80 people I think there's like 20 or 30

[<a id="00-57-11">00:57:11</a>]  that they can identify so one guy died before they could try him to you so

[<a id="00-57-16">00:57:16</a>]  let's get so there's 51 of them so you get to okay let's jump back in time a

[<a id="00-57-21">00:57:21</a>]  bit you get to Avenue on you you I got there a little before midnight 4 a.m. I

[<a id="00-57-28">00:57:28</a>]  got up I got there like close to 5 445 almost 5 a.m. thinking like it's a New

[<a id="00-57-35">00:57:35</a>]  York system where if you stand in line early enough you get to go in for the

[<a id="00-57-42">00:57:42</a>]  open to public that wasn't the case so there was nobody there so I come back

[<a id="00-57-48">00:57:48</a>]  two hours later by the time I come back at two hours later it's packed a lot of

[<a id="00-57-52">00:57:52</a>]  people clustering by the entrance so I went there stood took a bunch of

[<a id="00-57-57">00:57:57</a>]  pictures and stood in line nobody talked to me they're all talking French I think

[<a id="00-58-01">00:58:01</a>]  a lot of them are journalists you know eventually when they open the gates they

[<a id="00-58-06">00:58:06</a>]  start going in but they were checking credentials so what I tried to do what I

[<a id="00-58-11">00:58:11</a>]  tried to do is I tried to walk in like too busy looking the cell phone tried to

[<a id="00-58-14">00:58:14</a>]  sneak in the cop just saw exactly what I was saying he's like so I turned around

[<a id="00-58-21">00:58:21</a>]  and didn't go in so I took a bunch of pictures and waited around and there's

[<a id="00-58-27">00:58:27</a>]  other reporters who decide to stay out there's a bunch of feminists who they're

[<a id="00-58-31">00:58:31</a>]  outside so I kind of decided to stay there because I really want to see her

[<a id="00-58-36">00:58:36</a>]  in person I think two hours later yeah I think two hours later I finally there's

[<a id="00-58-46">00:58:46</a>]  a big commotion I've seen that movement before all that camera guys are running

[<a id="00-58-50">00:58:50</a>]  one direction something's up you know it's like a it's like a frenzy in ocean

[<a id="00-58-57">00:58:57</a>]  where shouts will go when there's a blood so when they start running I

[<a id="00-59-01">00:59:01</a>]  start following them and what I saw was three of victims kids you know flooring

[<a id="00-59-10">00:59:10</a>]  is that how you say it

[<a id="00-59-13">00:59:13</a>]  David and I forgot the daughter's name but they were walking and they look very

[<a id="00-59-18">00:59:18</a>]  dignified look serious they've been doing this since September third you

[<a id="00-59-23">00:59:23</a>]  know so and I shouldn't laugh but what while we were taking pictures two other

[<a id="00-59-30">00:59:30</a>]  camera guide fell down each other they got top of it so that simply have to

[<a id="00-59-35">00:59:35</a>]  stop a second and then they got up and continue on so they went in and I think

[<a id="00-59-39">00:59:39</a>]  that we still wait another 40 minutes maybe close to our finally Giselle

[<a id="00-59-44">00:59:44</a>]  showed up you know and typical French just classy dress dignifying and I like

[<a id="00-59-54">00:59:54</a>]  these women that they don't do surgery and stuff they do dignified makeup you

[<a id="00-59-59">00:59:59</a>]  know the confidence is the sexy you know and she looks dignified strong and

[<a id="01-00-04">01:00:04</a>]  determined and she took three months of abuse from defense attorneys asking all

[<a id="01-00-09">01:00:09</a>]  kinds of personal questions and attacks you know but in between all the rapists

[<a id="01-00-16">01:00:16</a>]  are sneaking like a little cockroaches that they were you know because when

[<a id="01-00-19">01:00:19</a>]  they're walking in I finally saw somebody speaking English like we're

[<a id="01-00-23">01:00:23</a>]  talking a little bit and I said oh look look at these guys they look like a

[<a id="01-00-27">01:00:27</a>]  rapist and the lady goes yeah they're there's a rapist so you know they got a

[<a id="01-00-33">01:00:33</a>]  hoodie on usually they got like COVID masking kind of thing going sometimes

[<a id="01-00-37">01:00:37</a>]  they have dark sunglasses they're being accompanied by police so they're not

[<a id="01-00-41">01:00:41</a>]  necessarily they're just walking in but they have to be at the trial for their

[<a id="01-00-46">01:00:46</a>]  sentencing or who's getting sentenced all those rapists that thing wow okay so

[<a id="01-00-52">01:00:52</a>]  they were coming in sometimes they come in parents sometime by myself and all

[<a id="01-00-56">01:00:56</a>]  those French people especially the French feminists they're sitting on like

[<a id="01-00-59">01:00:59</a>]  a fence on top of it and they're like perching from the the fence the way

[<a id="01-01-07">01:01:07</a>]  Japanese crow so like stand by a big fence and if you piss Japanese crow they

[<a id="01-01-13">01:01:13</a>]  kind of cackle and like mock you well they're jeering at these guys and I

[<a id="01-01-18">01:01:18</a>]  don't speak French whatever they were saying it must have been really mean and

[<a id="01-01-23">01:01:23</a>]  hilarious you know just talking shit to them and I thought holy shit there's a

[<a id="01-01-30">01:01:30</a>]  rapist and you know when I used to work at taboo video in Seattle there's a

[<a id="01-01-34">01:01:34</a>]  spots in the store where you could assault this shelf lifting customers and

[<a id="01-01-38">01:01:38</a>]  you won't be you won't be seen by camera so sometimes they'll do something bad

[<a id="01-01-45">01:01:45</a>]  I'll get a baseball bat and kind of hit those guys all of a sudden you see these

[<a id="01-01-49">01:01:49</a>]  crack heads flying across the room but you don't know why right so I've done

[<a id="01-01-54">01:01:54</a>]  plenty of that so I know what's up and and I told you this morning one of my

[<a id="01-02-00">01:02:00</a>]  favorite movie black rain when Michael Douglas character hit this Japanese mob

[<a id="01-02-05">01:02:05</a>]  guy in the face because he's acting like an asshole when they're flying back from

[<a id="01-02-09">01:02:09</a>]  New York to Osaka Japan he kind of you know kind of relaxing shoulder and next

[<a id="01-02-15">01:02:15</a>]  thing he just over that guy in the face so I did that twice so I kind of look

[<a id="01-02-21">01:02:21</a>]  over that he's coming out I kind of timed it like oh like that I got a I

[<a id="01-02-25">01:02:25</a>]  didn't hit him hard as I could because you I don't want to get in trouble for

[<a id="01-02-29">01:02:29</a>]  assault it's hard enough like it looked like an accident but it's just hard

[<a id="01-02-34">01:02:34</a>]  enough like aggravating kind of head so but you're in a crowd oh my god there's

[<a id="01-02-39">01:02:39</a>]  so many people yeah I'll show the video later on so I did it twice and there's a

[<a id="01-02-47">01:02:47</a>]  couple people saw me exactly there and they kind of wait kind of smile because

[<a id="01-02-50">01:02:50</a>]  they're kind of for what so I got guy I think guy in the face a little bit

[<a id="01-02-55">01:02:55</a>]  another guy in the chest unfortunately I stopped after third one because I thought

[<a id="01-03-00">01:03:00</a>]  I timed it right I ended up hitting a lady with big tits in the chest really

[<a id="01-03-05">01:03:05</a>]  hard I didn't mean to and I was talking to my friend Japan like what I just keep

[<a id="01-03-11">01:03:11</a>]  doing and like no because can you imagine I I hit two more people two more

[<a id="01-03-17">01:03:17</a>]  women accidentally so it looked like I'm at the rape trial hitting women I don't

[<a id="01-03-21">01:03:21</a>]  want to do that so I like okay one is enough like I said sorry she knew it I

[<a id="01-03-27">01:03:27</a>]  think she knew it was like because in this narrow alleyway kind of the fence

[<a id="01-03-32">01:03:32</a>]  is so packed with people right it's just pack and so after third one I stop you

[<a id="01-03-41">01:03:41</a>]  know because I mean I kind of technically sexually physical assault a

[<a id="01-03-44">01:03:44</a>]  lady at that thing so so so it's like two steps forward one back two and two so

[<a id="01-03-51">01:03:51</a>]  it's kind of wash so Giselle showed up she went in and we waited and waited and

[<a id="01-03-57">01:03:57</a>]  waited and I wasn't feeling that well so I left for about an hour and while I was

[<a id="01-04-06">01:04:06</a>]  home eating lunch and after shower I was kind of laid down the 10-minute nap they

[<a id="01-04-12">01:04:12</a>]  they order to deliver a decision which is kind of shocking how fast it is

[<a id="01-04-16">01:04:16</a>]  because in the States it takes so many hours before they have like they drag

[<a id="01-04-20">01:04:20</a>]  that shit for a long time so I put my clothes on I got back luckily by the

[<a id="01-04-26">01:04:26</a>]  time I got back she still didn't come out in fact I got back it took another

[<a id="01-04-29">01:04:29</a>]  two hours before she finally come out of the court you know and they cheer but in

[<a id="01-04-35">01:04:35</a>]  between when she showed up all this rapists are just sneaking out of there

[<a id="01-04-39">01:04:39</a>]  and they're getting jeered from people one of the feminists hit couple the guy

[<a id="01-04-45">01:04:45</a>]  in the face the cops really didn't do anything I mean what are you gonna do

[<a id="01-04-48">01:04:48</a>]  arrest her the place gonna go crazy and get mad at cops you know but one of the

[<a id="01-04-55">01:04:55</a>]  rapists he didn't cover his face he didn't give a shit he was like this

[<a id="01-04-58">01:04:58</a>]  that's right I fucking rape I think that's what he was saying something like

[<a id="01-05-02">01:05:02</a>]  that in French but he was like this like I don't give a shit yeah he wasn't that

[<a id="01-05-07">01:05:07</a>]  not even remorseful at all like I've seen character like that the movie to

[<a id="01-05-11">01:05:11</a>]  see it to see in person like holy fuck you know like that shit is real like

[<a id="01-05-17">01:05:17</a>]  there are people like that yeah look we know we all have like terrible ideas in

[<a id="01-05-24">01:05:24</a>]  your head you have like sexual urges and stuff that's okay just don't act on you

[<a id="01-05-31">01:05:31</a>]  know there's times I'm gonna kill people yeah don't murder people you know what I

[<a id="01-05-36">01:05:36</a>]  mean but these guys crossed the line you know and yeah I think the public were

[<a id="01-05-42">01:05:42</a>]  mad because I think they're getting between 3 to 18 years I don't know who's

[<a id="01-05-46">01:05:46</a>]  getting what but I still don't understand like if they're convicted

[<a id="01-05-49">01:05:49</a>]  they're gonna get sentenced why are they allowed to just leave like that you know

[<a id="01-05-53">01:05:53</a>]  I don't understand that at all because the husband they kept in the jail for

[<a id="01-05-58">01:05:58</a>]  whole time you know I don't know I don't know how work in France but all 51

[<a id="01-06-04">01:06:04</a>]  people were convicted you know that's why I like that makes sense there's no

[<a id="01-06-09">01:06:09</a>]  space because in addition to each rapist they have a legal cancelling to you so

[<a id="01-06-14">01:06:14</a>]  there's so many lawyers helping this rapist you on top of it victims family

[<a id="01-06-21">01:06:21</a>]  on top of it reporters so I was naive to think I had a chance to sneak in there I

[<a id="01-06-26">01:06:26</a>]  mean I don't speak French so like you know I mean I I didn't see Dominique or

[<a id="01-06-32">01:06:32</a>]  maybe I saw him but I didn't recognize him you know because there's just so

[<a id="01-06-36">01:06:36</a>]  many people walking in you know what I mean but as we really want as she was

[<a id="01-06-42">01:06:42</a>]  leaving and what kind of ages were these guys the rapist thing I can't tell

[<a id="01-06-48">01:06:48</a>]  because their face is covered the one the one that uncovered or like that guy

[<a id="01-06-52">01:06:52</a>]  must been I mean he could be between late 30 to 60 but I and he wasn't aging

[<a id="01-07-01">01:07:01</a>]  particularly well so like I couldn't tell what he's aged but he was taller

[<a id="01-07-04">01:07:04</a>]  than myself heavier and sick guy he was like what the fuck what are you gonna do

[<a id="01-07-08">01:07:08</a>]  you know he was like that mannerism and how was he dressed just like a guy of

[<a id="01-07-13">01:07:13</a>]  his age like a guy in the late 40s 30s 40s regular guy you know nothing

[<a id="01-07-19">01:07:19</a>]  fashionable but these women man night okay I got I could kind of see why

[<a id="01-07-25">01:07:25</a>]  radical famous are just angry about this stuff because even like as shameless as

[<a id="01-07-30">01:07:30</a>]  I am like I can't believe not these guys are not remorseful at all at all it's

[<a id="01-07-37">01:07:37</a>]  just it's just shocking to me I mean there's certainly you they don't think

[<a id="01-07-41">01:07:41</a>]  they did anything wrong but you must have met people in your life where I mean

[<a id="01-07-46">01:07:46</a>]  it's one thing is like I met people that kill people you know but you must have

[<a id="01-07-51">01:07:51</a>]  met people where you you just feel this is this person is pure evil it's like

[<a id="01-07-57">01:07:57</a>]  yeah and yeah I mean I guess some people it's like yeah this is who I am and I

[<a id="01-08-03">01:08:03</a>]  don't give a fuck yeah probably the ones covering up a bit more ashamed of what

[<a id="01-08-08">01:08:08</a>]  they've done but I met people like that but what's worse you know that people

[<a id="01-08-15">01:08:15</a>]  who are in position of power and getting people killed every day like this

[<a id="01-08-21">01:08:21</a>]  insurance thing that we were talking about deny insurance help so people are

[<a id="01-08-26">01:08:26</a>]  getting killed I mean these guys are murderous to you it's just that they

[<a id="01-08-31">01:08:31</a>]  don't they're not stabbing to them to death you know yeah yeah I mean but they

[<a id="01-08-35">01:08:35</a>]  could justify because they're in market and it's a corporate entity they're

[<a id="01-08-41">01:08:41</a>]  doing their job and that's their job to make money so they could justify it but

[<a id="01-08-46">01:08:46</a>]  I mean to me you see the thing the thing I get out of this is from this story

[<a id="01-08-57">01:08:57</a>]  yeah is is there must be a lot fucking more of this shit going on in France I

[<a id="01-09-04">01:09:04</a>]  mean probably across everywhere but I think everywhere yeah but but it's I

[<a id="01-09-11">01:09:11</a>]  mean I've run into from time to time I went to into this like speed dating

[<a id="01-09-16">01:09:16</a>]  thing and I still regret that I didn't I didn't go after this dude because we we

[<a id="01-09-22">01:09:22</a>]  had this this kind of evening where we did some stuff and then we then we went

[<a id="01-09-26">01:09:26</a>]  to have drinks together yeah and I was just in a good mood I was getting on

[<a id="01-09-31">01:09:31</a>]  with these ladies and you know yeah that's boosting my ego a little bit but

[<a id="01-09-35">01:09:35</a>]  then there's this guy who's just got a creepy vibe and I'm like yeah this guy

[<a id="01-09-39">01:09:39</a>]  he's he's acting to his vibe is too creepy these women don't want to talk to

[<a id="01-09-44">01:09:44</a>]  him yeah and then he goes why do you like that he then wanted to talk to me

[<a id="01-09-50">01:09:50</a>]  and within the first two sentences he made a joke about roofing like a roofie

[<a id="01-09-59">01:09:59</a>]  joke yeah it wasn't it was it was just something like now we're at the bar now

[<a id="01-10-05">01:10:05</a>]  we have now we have to be careful about roofies yeah and I'm like dude we've

[<a id="01-10-10">01:10:10</a>]  never spoken and that's your second sentence yeah and it's only afterwards I

[<a id="01-10-15">01:10:15</a>]  realized this motherfucker was one of those people and that shit drives me

[<a id="01-10-20">01:10:20</a>]  fucking wild to be honest because but isn't it weird because if the guy was

[<a id="01-10-24">01:10:24</a>]  really good-looking and young and charismatic you wouldn't get mad at that

[<a id="01-10-27">01:10:27</a>]  person you know sure but but in well yeah but also I mean fucking it's one

[<a id="01-10-36">01:10:36</a>]  thing of like crime of passion but but there's crime of premeditation because

[<a id="01-10-44">01:10:44</a>]  yeah because if you're like like to roofie someone you have to fucking plan

[<a id="01-10-50">01:10:50</a>]  that shit you have to get the drugs you have to be like oh tonight it's roofie

[<a id="01-10-55">01:10:55</a>]  night let me bring my roofies with me and yes by the way I'm just like you I'm

[<a id="01-10-59">01:10:59</a>]  against it but it's I'm also saying that it's really weird some people could say

[<a id="01-11-04">01:11:04</a>]  that stuff and people laugh at being charming you know like depends on who's

[<a id="01-11-08">01:11:08</a>]  saying it you know a guy looking like me saying it doesn't look great but

[<a id="01-11-12">01:11:12</a>]  somebody that looked like John Mulaney or Matt Rife saying it the women's like

[<a id="01-11-16">01:11:16</a>]  oh you've been so silly I'm just saying it's true yeah it's true like crime

[<a id="01-11-23">01:11:23</a>]  example yeah Bill Cosby when he was young good-looking dude and he I mean he

[<a id="01-11-28">01:11:28</a>]  fucking on what's the famous episode where he's saying I put some of that

[<a id="01-11-33">01:11:33</a>]  funny stuff in the barbecue yeah and everyone's ah and it's like and then we

[<a id="01-11-39">01:11:39</a>]  find out he's he's a it's like a kaisei sosei mood right like all along the

[<a id="01-11-44">01:11:44</a>]  things that they're saying is actually what they're exactly thinking they're

[<a id="01-11-48">01:11:48</a>]  also there's tons of that yeah because it's also exactly we talk about a lot of

[<a id="01-11-53">01:11:53</a>]  masturbation to have a long fucking time before he got caught you know I mean got

[<a id="01-11-56">01:11:56</a>]  in trouble for it and it's just pretty consistent you know because I think

[<a id="01-12-00">01:12:00</a>]  there's there's two sides so there's a one of you a desire to confess but then

[<a id="01-12-05">01:12:05</a>]  also there's also a desire to make people complicit in what you're doing

[<a id="01-12-11">01:12:11</a>]  because if a man that's true if you tell them what you're doing but in such a way

[<a id="01-12-17">01:12:17</a>]  they love instead of going like that's fucked up they've given implicit then

[<a id="01-12-22">01:12:22</a>]  you always said that one of the biggest guy who used to do that in England you

[<a id="01-12-26">01:12:26</a>]  know who that is I can I grew up with that dude Jimmy Saba yes because he

[<a id="01-12-32">01:12:32</a>]  never lied he always deflect by telling a joke but he was saying that kind of

[<a id="01-12-36">01:12:36</a>]  stuff all the fucking time exactly it's like kaisei sosei now after he passed

[<a id="01-12-40">01:12:40</a>]  away they look all the thing he said like he was kind of admitting that he

[<a id="01-12-43">01:12:43</a>]  was doing that and everyone went along with it and it I mean Louis Thoreau

[<a id="01-12-47">01:12:47</a>]  really feel bad because all along he couldn't ask a tougher question but he

[<a id="01-12-53">01:12:53</a>]  didn't do it because it was so unfathomable that somebody that famous

[<a id="01-12-57">01:12:57</a>]  could be doing that but he was doing it and I mean the guy that I went to

[<a id="01-13-00">01:13:00</a>]  brought more by the way walked around the guy I have respect for it if you

[<a id="01-13-05">01:13:05</a>]  know this John Lydon of the Sex Pistols because he said early on that he was

[<a id="01-13-10">01:13:10</a>]  raping kids he's right well he said it on the BBC and he got the Sex Pistols

[<a id="01-13-15">01:13:15</a>]  ban that they were never allowed on TV on because he said that because he's

[<a id="01-13-19">01:13:19</a>]  because he was on an interview and he goes yeah yeah we know what Jimmy Savile

[<a id="01-13-24">01:13:24</a>]  does he's a bit of a creepy guy isn't he and he's like at this point he's what

[<a id="01-13-28">01:13:28</a>]  20 maybe and and I mean this is the thing that this is where I am a not

[<a id="01-13-36">01:13:36</a>]  conspiracy theorist I've seen enough to know this shit's going on and and the

[<a id="01-13-42">01:13:42</a>]  Jimmy Savile case it's it's always you want to explain to listener because some

[<a id="01-13-47">01:13:47</a>]  people don't know what you're talking about so first of all yeah it's all

[<a id="01-13-51">01:13:51</a>]  right we'll go off on a tangent on this because so Jimmy Savile was this guy

[<a id="01-13-56">01:13:56</a>]  he's one of the can you explain because as an American I still don't know he's

[<a id="01-14-00">01:14:00</a>]  like a radio DJ TV presenter yeah it's it's even hard to say what he was when I

[<a id="01-14-04">01:14:04</a>]  grew up he was a guy who's on TV yeah so we had the chart shows called Top of the

[<a id="01-14-09">01:14:09</a>]  Pops he would be on that a lot he'd been a radio DJ yeah he had this program for

[<a id="01-14-15">01:14:15</a>]  kids called Jim or fix it yeah it's the most fun in retrospect there was a girl

[<a id="01-14-22">01:14:22</a>]  at my school actually went on this you would write in letters to Jimmy we'd

[<a id="01-14-27">01:14:27</a>]  hear in Cisco and you and there was a format all the kids are dear Jimmy can

[<a id="01-14-33">01:14:33</a>]  you fix it yeah now there's a specific term in fucking pedophile networks

[<a id="01-14-39">01:14:39</a>]  called being a fixer yeah and part of that is in the name of his show Jim or

[<a id="01-14-45">01:14:45</a>]  fix it yeah so anyway this one if I could get little letters from the kids I

[<a id="01-14-49">01:14:49</a>]  grew up I would see him every Sunday yeah you're fucking loved we do we like

[<a id="01-14-54">01:14:54</a>]  I'd go into school I'm like 7 8 years old everyone's taking me be fair for a

[<a id="01-14-58">01:14:58</a>]  second he was a great entertainer no question about yeah yeah it gets

[<a id="01-15-03">01:15:03</a>]  crazier than that because I mean I like to make this joke because I because I

[<a id="01-15-09">01:15:09</a>]  really made me question it when this thing came out of like fuck I saw this

[<a id="01-15-15">01:15:15</a>]  this guy I grew up with yes and he's got the most bizarre said about Michael

[<a id="01-15-21">01:15:21</a>]  Jackson but go ahead yeah but even more so than Michael Jackson so here's one

[<a id="01-15-26">01:15:26</a>]  little Jimmy fact I like to call them Jimmy facts a lot of people don't know

[<a id="01-15-30">01:15:30</a>]  he was the first guy ever to put to play non live music in a nightclub he was the

[<a id="01-15-37">01:15:37</a>]  first DJ he took records to a nightclub and started playing those instead of

[<a id="01-15-41">01:15:41</a>]  having a live band wow so he is the father of fucking everything that people

[<a id="01-15-48">01:15:48</a>]  listen to in a nightclub and I always made jokes he could say Jimmy kind of

[<a id="01-15-52">01:15:52</a>]  touched all of us and and then another thing is he used to be a wrestler so in

[<a id="01-15-58">01:15:58</a>]  English wrestling it was like like the shitty kind of WAF or whatever yeah but

[<a id="01-16-06">01:16:06</a>]  he was a wrestler on that and then he gets into like being a DJ and blah blah

[<a id="01-16-11">01:16:11</a>]  blah and another thing he used to do these

[<a id="01-16-14">01:16:14</a>]  charity runs yeah so he raised he made a big deal out of fact how much he raised

[<a id="01-16-20">01:16:20</a>]  money for children's hospitals yes he'd do these charity runs and he was always

[<a id="01-16-26">01:16:26</a>]  crossed the line with a cigar yeah and what he used to do is he is the London

[<a id="01-16-32">01:16:32</a>]  Marathon his big marathon he would just show up near the end someone would hand

[<a id="01-16-36">01:16:36</a>]  him a cigar and he crossed the line go there I just ran the thing and I raised

[<a id="01-16-40">01:16:40</a>]  all the money anything didn't even fucking run the race but if you look

[<a id="01-16-46">01:16:46</a>]  back at the stuff there's like videos of him molesting girls on camera atop of

[<a id="01-16-52">01:16:52</a>]  the pubs yeah okay and they say I was a different time you know it was okay for

[<a id="01-16-56">01:16:56</a>]  guys to grab girls assets but then there's another way so much money for

[<a id="01-17-00">01:17:00</a>]  hospital that sometime he had a private keys and office post places like

[<a id="01-17-04">01:17:04</a>]  Broadmoor and he'd go in middle of the night he'll molest kids and nobody would

[<a id="01-17-09">01:17:09</a>]  believe those kids there's been cases where he'll take couple of girls in the

[<a id="01-17-13">01:17:13</a>]  vehicle and if you want to get something I'll be on the TV you got to do

[<a id="01-17-17">01:17:17</a>]  something so he'll molest them I have them give them a blowjob and shit like

[<a id="01-17-20">01:17:20</a>]  that this went up for years nobody believed them there's a lot to that I

[<a id="01-17-25">01:17:25</a>]  know I like I went down a rabbit hole in this stuff because there's a bunch of

[<a id="01-17-29">01:17:29</a>]  stuff about this which because with all these things it's like first of all

[<a id="01-17-34">01:17:34</a>]  ever the BBC knew what he was doing and there are a lot of people that knew

[<a id="01-17-39">01:17:39</a>]  about it now there's knowing about it and then

[<a id="01-17-43">01:17:43</a>]  there's actually being involved in it and to me that's the part that's not

[<a id="01-17-48">01:17:48</a>]  being talked about you don't get to be like the guy raped over like two or

[<a id="01-17-55">01:17:55</a>]  three thousand there's two or three thousand reported cases and it's

[<a id="01-17-58">01:17:58</a>]  probably a lot more than that and but he was such a big figure that he was friend

[<a id="01-18-02">01:18:02</a>]  of the royal family as well you know also yeah if you search for Prince

[<a id="01-18-08">01:18:08</a>]  Charles Jimmy Saville there's pictures of them going back 30 years and the guy

[<a id="01-18-13">01:18:13</a>]  that Charles turned to when he's having trouble with Diana is fucking Jimmy

[<a id="01-18-17">01:18:17</a>]  Saville to convince to be fair it wasn't within the imagination that something

[<a id="01-18-22">01:18:22</a>]  like that was happening I don't think they knew they were that pretty naive

[<a id="01-18-25">01:18:25</a>]  yeah I don't think he was like yes keep molesting kids okay so let's let's let's

[<a id="01-18-30">01:18:30</a>]  get into this because on the one hand okay so you've got it's good buddy Jimmy

[<a id="01-18-36">01:18:36</a>]  who fucking is a massive paedophile then you have Prince Charles's brother Andrew

[<a id="01-18-41">01:18:41</a>]  who's on Epstein's Island yes then there's another guy if you watch the

[<a id="01-18-47">01:18:47</a>]  crown TV series there's this character called Lord Mountbatten and this is why

[<a id="01-18-51">01:18:51</a>]  I get into this because I grew up literally outside Lord Mountbatten's

[<a id="01-18-56">01:18:56</a>]  stately home in England and me and a buddy we used to sneak into the grounds

[<a id="01-19-01">01:19:01</a>]  because it was like this big forest that we could yeah when we were kids and so

[<a id="01-19-09">01:19:09</a>]  Lord Mountbatten the CIA you you got to search for Irish Times Lord Mountbatten

[<a id="01-19-14">01:19:14</a>]  paedophile or something the CIA released files on Lord Mountbatten and his wife

[<a id="01-19-21">01:19:21</a>]  and even the CIA were horrified by what degenerate paedophiles these guys were

[<a id="01-19-26">01:19:26</a>]  so this is his this is Prince Charles's I don't understand why the CIA have

[<a id="01-19-30">01:19:30</a>]  anything to do with like doing research about some paedophiles because the

[<a id="01-19-34">01:19:34</a>]  CIA is keeping I'm not I'm not I'm not questioning you but because the CIA is

[<a id="01-19-39">01:19:39</a>]  keeping files on everyone because that's like part of their job as foreign

[<a id="01-19-43">01:19:43</a>]  service you gotta have the Intel influential people yeah and and you know

[<a id="01-19-50">01:19:50</a>]  like it's well known it came out also with WikiLeaks but or everybody's spying

[<a id="01-19-55">01:19:55</a>]  on each other I wait so why do we jump into Jimmy Swag I mean I'm not Jimmy

[<a id="01-20-00">01:20:00</a>]  Swagger Jimmy Swaggle what do we jump into that one from Mazan I forgot let's

[<a id="01-20-08">01:20:08</a>]  get back to Mazan no no but I don't remember why I brought it up anyway yeah

[<a id="01-20-15">01:20:15</a>]  so I went to the case I know I know why I know why because I was trying to make

[<a id="01-20-21">01:20:21</a>]  the argument is is we always pretend oh it was just this one-off oh yeah and I'm

[<a id="01-20-29">01:20:29</a>]  like no like this shit is this shit is far more pervasive I think and and and

[<a id="01-20-40">01:20:40</a>]  it's the places it's like the same thing it's like people that pretend to be

[<a id="01-20-45">01:20:45</a>]  super nice like so Mazan looks like this perfect place and there's this she does

[<a id="01-20-50">01:20:50</a>]  look perfect place yeah and that's where you should be worried yeah that's my

[<a id="01-20-55">01:20:55</a>]  hypothesis and I bet and and that's the scene from David Lynch's blue velvet in

[<a id="01-21-01">01:21:01</a>]  the beginning you see this idyllic place in America it's beautiful it's a

[<a id="01-21-06">01:21:06</a>]  beautiful shot of this town and the cameras go down to the town to the house

[<a id="01-21-12">01:21:12</a>]  of the guy watering the lawn kids are having wonderful time and going down it

[<a id="01-21-17">01:21:17</a>]  goes underground to the ground where all this creepy crawly slimy insects are

[<a id="01-21-22">01:21:22</a>]  going going crazy that I think the whole idea in that scene was it might be a

[<a id="01-21-28">01:21:28</a>]  perfect place but underneath there is dark creepy shits are going on you know

[<a id="01-21-32">01:21:32</a>]  is that because I mean human especially in a place to me at least in cities

[<a id="01-21-38">01:21:38</a>]  there's entertainment yeah inversely when I went to war-torn place like

[<a id="01-21-42">01:21:42</a>]  Afghanistan where even the poorest places people are very gentle and like

[<a id="01-21-46">01:21:46</a>]  offering little food that they have yeah I was really moving because they don't

[<a id="01-21-50">01:21:50</a>]  have shit there you know so but I mean it's just like it's like the the human

[<a id="01-21-58">01:21:58</a>]  nature without struggle it gets bored and wants to do dumb shit yes now you

[<a id="01-22-02">01:22:02</a>]  go to Berlin you've got like the KitKat Club where you can just go there and

[<a id="01-22-07">01:22:07</a>]  consensually have sex of random people or whatever crazy shit you want to do

[<a id="01-22-12">01:22:12</a>]  and in a way people go oh that's kind of weird and gross but that is more honest

[<a id="01-22-19">01:22:19</a>]  than what's going on and they're adults too yeah like with with the the sex

[<a id="01-22-24">01:22:24</a>]  dungeon of Mozart it turns out it was in this ladies echo very well be only like

[<a id="01-22-29">01:22:29</a>]  one off there's only one guy who was doing the rest of the town just normal

[<a id="01-22-33">01:22:33</a>]  you know but it's it's also like you know it's like the per capita rapist

[<a id="01-22-41">01:22:41</a>]  per capita like me the number of rapists but thousand people this is basically

[<a id="01-22-47">01:22:47</a>]  saying like like with a hundred dudes that means that means one in every every

[<a id="01-22-53">01:22:53</a>]  ten dudes is in on this shit and I don't know I don't know the stats but I just

[<a id="01-22-58">01:22:58</a>]  know that to think like if he never got caught he will continue on his wife or

[<a id="01-23-04">01:23:04</a>]  just wondering what's wrong with her there was a period where she thought she

[<a id="01-23-08">01:23:08</a>]  was suffering from Alzheimer's and maybe she was getting all because her body's

[<a id="01-23-12">01:23:12</a>]  aching all the time and over the weekend she's always sleepy because all he's

[<a id="01-23-16">01:23:16</a>]  always kind of knocking her out and once she received prescription for that

[<a id="01-23-23">01:23:23</a>]  sleeping pill or whatever the pill to knock her out her husband found a legal

[<a id="01-23-28">01:23:28</a>]  way to keep getting refill and he had like hundreds and hundreds of those

[<a id="01-23-33">01:23:33</a>]  fucking pills and knock her out you know and I just because I guess it's just

[<a id="01-23-42">01:23:42</a>]  amazing because he was like mentor you know he's almost like a Sith road Lord

[<a id="01-23-49">01:23:49</a>]  who's training these training guy because sometimes one of the guys got in

[<a id="01-23-52">01:23:52</a>]  trouble not raping his wife he asked Dominique to help him knock his wife and

[<a id="01-23-57">01:23:57</a>]  help him rape his own wife who are knocked out you know and and it's like

[<a id="01-24-05">01:24:05</a>]  the food dummies version so he was doing that so my question is I don't know the

[<a id="01-24-11">01:24:11</a>]  legal situation friends but what I hear from the critic and feminist their lives

[<a id="01-24-18">01:24:18</a>]  really relaxed and not taking sex crime seriously compared to other countries

[<a id="01-24-23">01:24:23</a>]  maybe it's pretty relaxed in Switzerland as well I mean yeah and my question is I

[<a id="01-24-29">01:24:29</a>]  mean I'm not gonna be wrong I'll be dead by then but I'm kind of curious what

[<a id="01-24-32">01:24:32</a>]  what the France gonna look like 50 years from now how big of an impact this

[<a id="01-24-38">01:24:38</a>]  case gonna have I'm kind of curious is this like a one-time thing they will

[<a id="01-24-41">01:24:41</a>]  forget or they're gonna use this to actually hopefully take this thing

[<a id="01-24-46">01:24:46</a>]  seriously because I mean thank God for those police because if they just cut

[<a id="01-24-51">01:24:51</a>]  him up skirt and give him a small fine and they didn't do anything beyond that

[<a id="01-24-55">01:24:55</a>]  you ever just continue on you know keep doing it I mean I guess the question is

[<a id="01-25-01">01:25:01</a>]  is how how deep they're willing to dig into this and if because because this is

[<a id="01-25-07">01:25:07</a>]  where like there's been in this painting there's some kind of conspiracy look at

[<a id="01-25-12">01:25:12</a>]  you know about the true case in in Belgium this guy marked the truth he was

[<a id="01-25-18">01:25:18</a>]  this guy he was kidnapping girls and raping them having them in a dungeon and

[<a id="01-25-25">01:25:25</a>]  then murder and buried them right yeah and his wife was helping him yeah but

[<a id="01-25-30">01:25:30</a>]  then that was a really shocking one because one time he could get hard so

[<a id="01-25-34">01:25:34</a>]  what she did was she gave him a blow job he got hard so he was able to rape this

[<a id="01-25-40">01:25:40</a>]  young girl that they murder her so she was complicit the whole time yeah and

[<a id="01-25-45">01:25:45</a>]  and then but but the thing is you know how that took down the Belgian government

[<a id="01-25-49">01:25:49</a>]  oh that I didn't know they had this there was this particular demonstration

[<a id="01-25-57">01:25:57</a>]  I had like a million Belgium's is called the white white revolution or something

[<a id="01-26-02">01:26:02</a>]  yeah because the Belgian government tried to cover it up and why were they

[<a id="01-26-07">01:26:07</a>]  trying to cover up because this guy he was another fixer but he was in he's an

[<a id="01-26-12">01:26:12</a>]  idiot he was procuring kids for wealthy people and that way so in addition to he

[<a id="01-26-18">01:26:18</a>]  because maybe I'm remembering wrong but I remember sometimes you drive like our

[<a id="01-26-23">01:26:23</a>]  two hours away from his home kidnap a girl driver all the way to his estate

[<a id="01-26-28">01:26:28</a>]  and and I remember the reason why they have money because they had a buddy who

[<a id="01-26-34">01:26:34</a>]  were criminals stole money they're supposed to hold on to it it's supposed

[<a id="01-26-38">01:26:38</a>]  to stole the money and that that you know it's the same guy right the guy

[<a id="01-26-42">01:26:42</a>]  with the money it was the guy that's the connection to all that like there was

[<a id="01-26-47">01:26:47</a>]  some like a criminal aristocrats these some of these kids were okay so he took

[<a id="01-26-52">01:26:52</a>]  the money about a state and now he had a big facility you know this joke I it's

[<a id="01-26-57">01:26:57</a>]  kind of the funny thing I talk about and like something somebody asked me hey how

[<a id="01-27-01">01:27:01</a>]  come we don't have as many serial killers in America it's because the

[<a id="01-27-05">01:27:05</a>]  young serial killers can afford to have their own place to murder people they

[<a id="01-27-10">01:27:10</a>]  don't have the backyard to bury places you know yeah you need to have a place

[<a id="01-27-17">01:27:17</a>]  to do that you know a very least apartment like Jeffrey Dahmer so they

[<a id="01-27-23">01:27:23</a>]  have this money they they had access to some illegal money that they got it from

[<a id="01-27-28">01:27:28</a>]  another criminal or something he bought this biggest day so he used to hide all

[<a id="01-27-32">01:27:32</a>]  those bodies throughout that place you know but it's a little bit the thing the

[<a id="01-27-37">01:27:37</a>]  thing is this is like that it's it's what was what was his name again

[<a id="01-27-42">01:27:42</a>]  mark do true that's right it's fairly well documented at this point there are

[<a id="01-27-48">01:27:48</a>]  enough victims that came out and linked him to various powerful people imagine

[<a id="01-27-53">01:27:53</a>]  it took down the Belgian government and when I moved to Switzerland yeah that

[<a id="01-27-58">01:27:58</a>]  case was spreading all over Europe because other politicians were getting

[<a id="01-28-03">01:28:03</a>]  fingered and then suddenly it vanished from the news can I also tell you a

[<a id="01-28-08">01:28:08</a>]  counter-argument not a car argument but sometimes they use child abuse to get

[<a id="01-28-14">01:28:14</a>]  rid of opponents when they're completely innocent - you know yeah or they would I

[<a id="01-28-19">01:28:19</a>]  don't know how you do it but you sneak into somebody's account and put a child

[<a id="01-28-22">01:28:22</a>]  porn in there and all of a sudden that guy's a chopper pornographer or whatever

[<a id="01-28-25">01:28:25</a>]  yeah yeah but but the thing is I mean this is it's not conspiracy theories is

[<a id="01-28-30">01:28:30</a>]  it actually isn't and this is the point where I get a little annoyed with people

[<a id="01-28-35">01:28:35</a>]  in general because you say oh there was this one freak who did this thing it was

[<a id="01-28-41">01:28:41</a>]  a complete freak like ah it's like no like Jimmy Savile was fucking best

[<a id="01-28-48">01:28:48</a>]  friends with Prince Charles whose uncle and brother are also massive pedophiles

[<a id="01-28-53">01:28:53</a>]  like that's one example and it reflects on the fact is that confirmed that

[<a id="01-28-58">01:28:58</a>]  they're pedophiles you know Prince Andrew he's got trouble he got in trouble he

[<a id="01-29-04">01:29:04</a>]  definitely like he's he well he paid off you got to be careful when you say stuff

[<a id="01-29-10">01:29:10</a>]  like this he paid off the 14 year old that he fucked and are you sure about

[<a id="01-29-16">01:29:16</a>]  this you have the name and I know but I can go and dig it up and prove the thing

[<a id="01-29-21">01:29:21</a>]  I mean he's and so you know we may have to edit this because saying it publicly

[<a id="01-29-27">01:29:27</a>]  but George Stefanopoulos just got in trouble with ABC and they had to pay

[<a id="01-29-33">01:29:33</a>]  think Trump's President Trump but that's 10 or 15 million dollars for saying but

[<a id="01-29-38">01:29:38</a>]  that's exactly the point you got arrested for rape because because you're I mean I

[<a id="01-29-43">01:29:43</a>]  mean that's exactly the point I think oh now I have to be careful about what I

[<a id="01-29-46">01:29:46</a>]  say the point the point is no no I'm just saying that if you're gonna say

[<a id="01-29-50">01:29:50</a>]  make sure you have you've got your back you gotta have your facts right that's

[<a id="01-29-53">01:29:53</a>]  all but but the thing is it is like I bet you that if you we look into this

[<a id="01-30-00">01:30:00</a>]  Maldon case close enough yeah there's more going on to this shit minimum you

[<a id="01-30-05">01:30:05</a>]  could say is that is that the health insurance company the doctor who's

[<a id="01-30-10">01:30:10</a>]  providing these drugs but can I can I also tell you like you could make all

[<a id="01-30-13">01:30:13</a>]  kinds of conspiracy because you made a good point to me because I go to so many

[<a id="01-30-17">01:30:17</a>]  these places right so for somebody gonna adventure saying like hey have you

[<a id="01-30-21">01:30:21</a>]  noticed Asian guy did you see him at the Glen Maskell thing they see it did you

[<a id="01-30-28">01:30:28</a>]  see him at the men in this case I was there there's a family did you see him

[<a id="01-30-33">01:30:33</a>]  at Mazda rape case yeah so yeah old son you could make a claim like I have some

[<a id="01-30-42">01:30:42</a>]  I don't have anything to do with any of them except I got up okay but I

[<a id="01-30-46">01:30:46</a>]  understand because that kind of stuff happened to me before like somebody

[<a id="01-30-49">01:30:49</a>]  accused me or something you'd have a very hard time defending it because also

[<a id="01-30-53">01:30:53</a>]  but no because what's the press gonna do and in court they're gonna say and he

[<a id="01-30-57">01:30:57</a>]  used to work for evil angel and look at him see he was here for the Gillette

[<a id="01-31-02">01:31:02</a>]  Maxwell case look he's at SPF Elizabeth home President Trump moose daddy

[<a id="01-31-10">01:31:10</a>]  Massachusetts Harvey Weinstein on and on yeah yeah you can make all kinds of

[<a id="01-31-17">01:31:17</a>]  claim doesn't make it true but well you gotta okay I will say this is that the

[<a id="01-31-22">01:31:22</a>]  as far as I'm concerned oh no maybe nobody believes me I have not raped

[<a id="01-31-27">01:31:27</a>]  anyone but and I'm not planning to rape anyone to answer your question like

[<a id="01-31-31">01:31:31</a>]  with yeah it's could could be in 50 years this be true case if you dig into

[<a id="01-31-36">01:31:36</a>]  that one and a lot of it's documentary yeah it's like that thing is was the

[<a id="01-31-43">01:31:43</a>]  starting point of a lot of desert there's a path from there yeah to the

[<a id="01-31-48">01:31:48</a>]  exposure of Jimmy Savile and to some of the Epstein stuff is that it gradually

[<a id="01-31-55">01:31:55</a>]  started to wake people up to the fact that this shit is going on now with with

[<a id="01-32-00">01:32:00</a>]  what's happening in Mozart is that I think that's a good thing that may also

[<a id="01-32-05">01:32:05</a>]  lead to a waking up so you know like like I just think it's very very hard

[<a id="01-32-12">01:32:12</a>]  for average good person because they're good they can't imagine that someone

[<a id="01-32-18">01:32:18</a>]  could do something like that and clearly vast majority do not do that but when

[<a id="01-32-25">01:32:25</a>]  you have six or seven billion people one million but one percent is still a lot

[<a id="01-32-29">01:32:29</a>]  of people doing that kind of shit you know and there's still enough of it

[<a id="01-32-35">01:32:35</a>]  it's just that I don't know enough of that conspiracy part you know and the

[<a id="01-32-39">01:32:39</a>]  reason why I get a little cautious because some people need conspiracy

[<a id="01-32-48">01:32:48</a>]  because it makes sense out of oh yeah it makes sense in the crazy world

[<a id="01-32-57">01:32:57</a>]  conspiracy make things explanation yeah but I'm just saying sometimes there's

[<a id="01-33-03">01:33:03</a>]  things in life that like it makes no sense at all it's not it's not on

[<a id="01-33-07">01:33:07</a>]  purpose it just makes no sense you know but but between those two ideas they're

[<a id="01-33-13">01:33:13</a>]  not they're actually not mutually exclusive yeah because you can you know

[<a id="01-33-17">01:33:17</a>]  you can you can have a bunch of people yeah fucking some dude's wife and never

[<a id="01-33-22">01:33:22</a>]  talking about yes one time yeah and that is a conspiracy yeah a conspiracy is two

[<a id="01-33-29">01:33:29</a>]  or more people doing something I don't know what's the legal definition but is

[<a id="01-33-34">01:33:34</a>]  that and and yeah so what's your what's out of it's it's that thing Alan Moore

[<a id="01-33-43">01:33:43</a>]  talk about conspiracy and I don't remember exactly the quote but it's

[<a id="01-33-49">01:33:49</a>]  terrifying to people that that that they have to have a conspiracy knowing that

[<a id="01-33-54">01:33:54</a>]  there's some exterior power doing all this terrible things it gives them

[<a id="01-33-58">01:33:58</a>]  little bit of relief because at least they know that there is something causing

[<a id="01-34-03">01:34:03</a>]  all these things yeah Alan Moore counter by saying no we live in a rudderless

[<a id="01-34-09">01:34:09</a>]  world where it's just rained by chaos which is more terrifying because to

[<a id="01-34-16">01:34:16</a>]  think that life have no meaning and it's just chaotic it's it's more terrifying

[<a id="01-34-21">01:34:21</a>]  than having a conspiracy where it gives sense like an order to a world it's a

[<a id="01-34-26">01:34:26</a>]  terrible order but there's a explanation why some terrible things happen and I

[<a id="01-34-30">01:34:30</a>]  kind of like what Alan Moore said it's more terrifying to think that none of it

[<a id="01-34-35">01:34:35</a>]  ever makes sense you know obey or but let me flip that back on itself is or

[<a id="01-34-42">01:34:42</a>]  isn't it better to have a nice explanation about why human beings you

[<a id="01-34-49">01:34:49</a>]  know like one conspiracies but we can dismiss it so that nobody actually goes

[<a id="01-34-55">01:34:55</a>]  and looks what the fuck yeah I'm not saying there's any conspiracy there

[<a id="01-34-59">01:34:59</a>]  clearly is conspiracies it's just that I don't believe everything yeah yeah and I

[<a id="01-35-05">01:35:05</a>]  don't know a lot of it you know sometimes I get teased and criticized by

[<a id="01-35-10">01:35:10</a>]  someone like Sam Tripoli because he knows so much Joe Rogan or so much I

[<a id="01-35-14">01:35:14</a>]  don't I just don't know I'm not against it I've just it just never had an

[<a id="01-35-17">01:35:17</a>]  interest in them you know I think the interesting part for me is he's saying

[<a id="01-35-21">01:35:21</a>]  about like how normal people how can you process and handle this I think the

[<a id="01-35-26">01:35:26</a>]  biggest straw I mean I have a hard time too sometimes yeah and and I follow this

[<a id="01-35-32">01:35:32</a>]  shit I think this part of the struggle is yeah being able to acknowledge how far

[<a id="01-35-39">01:35:39</a>]  you can relate to something so so for example fucking everybody's looked at

[<a id="01-35-46">01:35:46</a>]  porn everybody's yeah some porn that they don't want to go and tell their mom

[<a id="01-35-52">01:35:52</a>]  about oh sure I mean when you see beautiful women sleeping like that of

[<a id="01-35-56">01:35:56</a>]  course your mind go places they shouldn't go and but nevertheless I still think

[<a id="01-36-00">01:36:00</a>]  that's okay to think like that just don't act on it yeah yeah but but it's

[<a id="01-36-04">01:36:04</a>]  it's I think for a lot of people they they're not willing to even entertain

[<a id="01-36-10">01:36:10</a>]  the possibility that it's it's come somehow a scale from you looking at

[<a id="01-36-15">01:36:15</a>]  milk porn to somebody actually fucking somebody's drugged mom yeah and I'll

[<a id="01-36-22">01:36:22</a>]  drug anyone you know drug anyone and that and that this is kind of the

[<a id="01-36-27">01:36:27</a>]  ultimate fear is a fear of fear of acknowledging your own shit yes and and

[<a id="01-36-34">01:36:34</a>]  then and that makes you think like when you tell someone about the easiest thing

[<a id="01-36-40">01:36:40</a>]  is to make this guy and these these 80 others to call them all monsters well

[<a id="01-36-46">01:36:46</a>]  our good friend who used to live here in Switzerland Carl Jung had a quote I

[<a id="01-36-51">01:36:51</a>]  don't exactly how that go but like something about so it's like a tree the

[<a id="01-36-55">01:36:55</a>]  top of the trees aiming for the sky the ideal idealism right but the roots are

[<a id="01-37-02">01:37:02</a>]  rooted into hell yeah so you there's part of you you have a good and a bad you

[<a id="01-37-08">01:37:08</a>]  have a bit of a struggle you know you cannot do good unless you choose to do

[<a id="01-37-12">01:37:12</a>]  good over all the terrible things that we hope we all have a little bit of good

[<a id="01-37-17">01:37:17</a>]  and bad in us you know and you got a struggle and hopefully you do more good

[<a id="01-37-22">01:37:22</a>]  than bad obviously but you you I joke around keep saying like ethical pervert

[<a id="01-37-32">01:37:32</a>]  because I think you know right after 9/11 Tom Freeman who writes for New York

[<a id="01-37-37">01:37:37</a>]  Time like the reason why something like that happened because most people can

[<a id="01-37-41">01:37:41</a>]  imagine something like that happened and people in position of power protecting

[<a id="01-37-45">01:37:45</a>]  us you have evil imagination right like how do you prevent something bad from

[<a id="01-37-50">01:37:50</a>]  happening if you can't even imagine that happened first place yeah right so you

[<a id="01-37-54">01:37:54</a>]  have to have that a little bit of the imagination something bad in you to

[<a id="01-37-58">01:37:58</a>]  prevent something from happening I think that's why a lot of times cops think

[<a id="01-38-02">01:38:02</a>]  everybody's lying because they deal with too many people lying to them right so

[<a id="01-38-06">01:38:06</a>]  they can be hard-ass but maybe they have to be hard-ass because they're also

[<a id="01-38-09">01:38:09</a>]  protecting us too you know I mean how do you make the balance like you wanted to

[<a id="01-38-14">01:38:14</a>]  do good but you can't be too naive either yeah you know what I mean and it

[<a id="01-38-18">01:38:18</a>]  can be too cynical so you got to do a balancing act about the good and bad and

[<a id="01-38-23">01:38:23</a>]  then hopefully we could prevent something from this happening like I

[<a id="01-38-28">01:38:28</a>]  remember the cases in states where these three high school kids raped this girl

[<a id="01-38-33">01:38:33</a>]  dragged out they filmed it and they're all talking neighborhood eventually

[<a id="01-38-37">01:38:37</a>]  they were convicted you know and that there's a young kid made terrible

[<a id="01-38-42">01:38:42</a>]  decision and the parents of those kids are upset because their son's lives are

[<a id="01-38-48">01:38:48</a>]  ruined but she can't take account like you raised somebody who raped a young

[<a id="01-38-53">01:38:53</a>]  girl who was yes she was drunk yeah but it didn't warrant rape either you know

[<a id="01-39-00">01:39:00</a>]  we should like that I was I that's a prime example is I want to go and look

[<a id="01-39-06">01:39:06</a>]  at exactly what's happening in that home yeah and who is around those kids and

[<a id="01-39-12">01:39:12</a>]  sometimes they could be completely good kids and sometimes people ended up doing

[<a id="01-39-16">01:39:16</a>]  because situational thing you know yeah like there are plenty of us I mean I

[<a id="01-39-23">01:39:23</a>]  think Amber you said it or maybe somebody like that experts and like

[<a id="01-39-27">01:39:27</a>]  their situational rapist they're not really rapist but sometimes given the

[<a id="01-39-31">01:39:31</a>]  wrong situations the opportunity they do stuff like that you know well no comment

[<a id="01-39-40">01:39:40</a>]  but so I just said that was a moment of but cases like this really will make me

[<a id="01-39-48">01:39:48</a>]  think about Japanese during those Japanese soldiers during World War two

[<a id="01-39-54">01:39:54</a>]  they rape and murder all those Chinese people now King and I think if you talk

[<a id="01-39-58">01:39:58</a>]  to if you had a chance to talk to those perpetrator that the rapist if you talk

[<a id="01-40-04">01:40:04</a>]  to them I mean they're dead now but imagine if I had an opportunity to talk

[<a id="01-40-08">01:40:08</a>]  to them I bet you a lot of them probably came from average household like where

[<a id="01-40-12">01:40:12</a>]  the rape was encouraged you know but something about group thinking and if

[<a id="01-40-18">01:40:18</a>]  one see somebody doing also everybody think it's okay sure I mean Germans are

[<a id="01-40-24">01:40:24</a>]  very sophisticated group well educated they have a high standard of education

[<a id="01-40-28">01:40:28</a>]  they're more more or less and they live under Church Catholic Church Reformation

[<a id="01-40-36">01:40:36</a>]  these are sophisticated civilization morality and what what you what happened

[<a id="01-40-41">01:40:41</a>]  they did terrible terrible things and it's a very small percentage of course

[<a id="01-40-44">01:40:44</a>]  but why does stuff like this happen you know finality of evil as one of the

[<a id="01-40-50">01:40:50</a>]  experts will talk about and I don't know you know why it happened it did happen

[<a id="01-40-55">01:40:55</a>]  and Japanese did it too you know so but but this rape thing kind of think me

[<a id="01-41-02">01:41:02</a>]  like why does this happen and and when I hear situations like this it does make

[<a id="01-41-08">01:41:08</a>]  me think why do they abuse kids because I think one of the conspiracy things I

[<a id="01-41-14">01:41:14</a>]  keep thinking about powerful people want to maintain power and when people get in

[<a id="01-41-19">01:41:19</a>]  their way they will use necessary means to stop them and if you have a group of

[<a id="01-41-24">01:41:24</a>]  people who are willing to do anything and anybody who murder and rape kids

[<a id="01-41-30">01:41:30</a>]  once they cross that line they're capable of doing anything sure for the

[<a id="01-41-35">01:41:35</a>]  powerful people you know like once you rape a kid or murder a kid you I mean

[<a id="01-41-41">01:41:41</a>]  you've really gone to places where yeah you really got to the place where I mean

[<a id="01-41-47">01:41:47</a>]  I think they've just reprobate I mean I know Christian people think they could

[<a id="01-41-51">01:41:51</a>]  provide salvation to people like that but I don't know I don't know about that

[<a id="01-41-55">01:41:55</a>]  but okay so now this episode just going everywhere but but so let's try and wrap

[<a id="01-42-02">01:42:02</a>]  it up so it I know it's early you just got back yeah but what's like what's

[<a id="01-42-09">01:42:09</a>]  what's the thing that you take away from having gone to see this trial oh like is

[<a id="01-42-16">01:42:16</a>]  it is there some insight or something yeah I mean it is incredible this Giselle

[<a id="01-42-29">01:42:29</a>]  Petticoe I hope I'm pronouncing name right I think she's incredible lady I

[<a id="01-42-34">01:42:34</a>]  think she's so dignified and I think she was more worried about her kids feelings

[<a id="01-42-41">01:42:41</a>]  more than anything but I think she really is an icon you know because she

[<a id="01-42-47">01:42:47</a>]  could have had this private court case where nobody saw what happened to her

[<a id="01-42-51">01:42:51</a>]  these guys were probably got same kind of punishment but she said no let let

[<a id="01-42-56">01:42:56</a>]  the whole world know what happened to her and anybody who were in that room

[<a id="01-43-00">01:43:00</a>]  courtroom for those 90 days from September 3rd they saw every clip when

[<a id="01-43-05">01:43:05</a>]  she was getting raped supposedly you know she didn't hide and she exposed

[<a id="01-43-11">01:43:11</a>]  these rapists like the cockroach that they are you know light to the world you

[<a id="01-43-15">01:43:15</a>]  know how when you put a light all the coverage just run away because they're

[<a id="01-43-18">01:43:18</a>]  cowards and I hope people take away see how brave and because I'm not like a

[<a id="01-43-26">01:43:26</a>]  bleeding liver or anything like that but I'm just stunned by her dignity in the

[<a id="01-43-33">01:43:33</a>]  whole thing and I think she wasn't just thinking about her I really think she

[<a id="01-43-37">01:43:37</a>]  was thinking on behalf of all others who are getting raped doesn't know what

[<a id="01-43-42">01:43:42</a>]  happened to them all the victims both men and women she didn't show any sort

[<a id="01-43-46">01:43:46</a>]  of sign like she hates men and I mean you should see all this radical feminist

[<a id="01-43-52">01:43:52</a>]  and anybody who supported their date they adore her they cheer for her and how

[<a id="01-44-00">01:44:00</a>]  magnificent she is you know she was just so dignified you know and I think in my

[<a id="01-44-05">01:44:05</a>]  lifetime I've seen a lot of amazing people but really I really have to think

[<a id="01-44-12">01:44:12</a>]  but two women that I've seen in person that is just like blow me away like

[<a id="01-44-19">01:44:19</a>]  there's just so incredible in my opinion was Angela Merkel and this lady from the

[<a id="01-44-26">01:44:26</a>]  Amazon they're just a they're a woman yeah they're serious people and there's

[<a id="01-44-35">01:44:35</a>]  nothing trivial about these people you know they're just a pretty amazing

[<a id="01-44-39">01:44:39</a>]  serious women and like someone like Angela Merkel I just think that's a

[<a id="01-44-47">01:44:47</a>]  tough lady you know engineer major for Eastern Europe she went through shit to

[<a id="01-44-54">01:44:54</a>]  able to run a country that powerful most powerful country in Europe with a

[<a id="01-44-58">01:44:58</a>]  dignity and respect and I think she did an outstanding job I think people have a

[<a id="01-45-03">01:45:03</a>]  lot of respect for her and Giselle I think a lot of people have respect for

[<a id="01-45-07">01:45:07</a>]  her too you know but yeah to get a jujitsu move on this fucking rapist and

[<a id="01-45-12">01:45:12</a>]  expose them I hope this will have a positive impact in Europe and rest of

[<a id="01-45-17">01:45:17</a>]  the world you know because I think I'm glad I got I got to see her in person

[<a id="01-45-22">01:45:22</a>]  because I think that's probably the first and last time you know to see I've

[<a id="01-45-26">01:45:26</a>]  got to see her multiple times on that same day I'm curious what what what

[<a id="01-45-32">01:45:32</a>]  does this mean and you thanked her yeah I don't think she heard me but I like

[<a id="01-45-38">01:45:38</a>]  this kind of historical dates where when I went October 31st 2017 that town in

[<a id="01-45-44">01:45:44</a>]  Germany for the 500 year anniversary of Reformation I like going to these kind

[<a id="01-45-48">01:45:48</a>]  of event you know because it kind of means something when you meet people I

[<a id="01-45-53">01:45:53</a>]  have a surprise how many Americans show for that both Christian and even like

[<a id="01-45-59">01:45:59</a>]  Muslims showed up kind of show respect for that I kind of like that did that

[<a id="01-46-03">01:46:03</a>]  little bit of a reverence you know I think so 500 years from now this this

[<a id="01-46-10">01:46:10</a>]  case and then they might make her like a secular saint in a way I think and

[<a id="01-46-17">01:46:17</a>]  there's just this little photo with this like yeah there's a lot of picture of me

[<a id="01-46-22">01:46:22</a>]  taking picture and some historian yeah yeah and should we wrap there yeah I

[<a id="01-46-29">01:46:29</a>]  think we should wrap it I'm still kind of I think I'm trying to process in the

[<a id="01-46-36">01:46:36</a>]  whole thing because I'm really glad I'm with because I think I think she means

[<a id="01-46-42">01:46:42</a>]  something I really do yeah a couple of my female friends were kind of all by me

[<a id="01-46-49">01:46:49</a>]  showing up especially with my background working for porno company of the fourth

[<a id="01-46-52">01:46:52</a>]  circle you know like to be that part I'm a pervert too but like I'm a you and I

[<a id="01-46-59">01:46:59</a>]  we're like pervert with the cap a lowercase P these motherfuck I mean I just

[<a id="01-47-06">01:47:06</a>]  couldn't imagine there is a chat room where people talk and do this kind of

[<a id="01-47-10">01:47:10</a>]  shit you know I mean yeah I don't I don't I really don't do a lot of online

[<a id="01-47-16">01:47:16</a>]  chicks of like print Instagram picture listen to podcast anything beyond I

[<a id="01-47-20">01:47:20</a>]  really don't do it I'm an Asian but there's a lot of technical shape that I

[<a id="01-47-25">01:47:25</a>]  don't know how to do you know but I'm glad I went I learned something and I

[<a id="01-47-31">01:47:31</a>]  hope I could incorporate this knowledge to share with others you know and I mean

[<a id="01-47-39">01:47:39</a>]  a serious note you have a daughter you want to protect her so you know you you

[<a id="01-47-44">01:47:44</a>]  want to talk to her and have a conversation there are many good men

[<a id="01-47-48">01:47:48</a>]  there's many bad men and you want to help her make sure you know I mean

[<a id="01-47-54">01:47:54</a>]  assuming she's heterosexual and if she's not she had to pick the right lady or

[<a id="01-47-58">01:47:58</a>]  whatever but you want to prepare your kids for the world and there are people

[<a id="01-48-02">01:48:02</a>]  like that out there you know and I think it's good to have a conversation when

[<a id="01-48-07">01:48:07</a>]  something like this happened you know it's scary and terrible and awful it is

[<a id="01-48-12">01:48:12</a>]  I think it's important to talk and something is every time I mention it vast

[<a id="01-48-17">01:48:17</a>]  majority of people still don't know because they don't follow news you know

[<a id="01-48-20">01:48:20</a>]  yeah when I told my friend I was an avion for miles on rape case they asked me oh

[<a id="01-48-26">01:48:26</a>]  is that a play because it's an avion because it's a big theater event place

[<a id="01-48-31">01:48:31</a>]  who knows maybe it will become a prize no no it's it's definitely somebody's

[<a id="01-48-36">01:48:36</a>]  gonna do a play somebody it's gonna be a TV series for sure 100% and I'm

[<a id="01-48-44">01:48:44</a>]  guaranteed it's gonna be movie or TV series 100% guarantee it's gonna happen

[<a id="01-48-49">01:48:49</a>]  because that way will attract more information out there but I'm glad I

[<a id="01-48-55">01:48:55</a>]  went because this will prepare for me for Diddy May 5th 2025 you know and I

[<a id="01-49-03">01:49:03</a>]  think after Diddy I'm coming closing I think after Diddy if I go and get in and

[<a id="01-49-08">01:49:08</a>]  see it it might be like one of the last thing I do because I'm not gonna lie

[<a id="01-49-12">01:49:12</a>]  this trial it took me a lot out of me because to see those guys and how yeah

[<a id="01-49-20">01:49:20</a>]  it really took something out of me man like this is really disappointing people

[<a id="01-49-26">01:49:26</a>]  behaving that way yeah but every time I see that I go blah blah there's a there

[<a id="01-49-32">01:49:32</a>]  are a lot of good people too you know I gotta I gotta balance things thing by

[<a id="01-49-37">01:49:37</a>]  good and bad yeah that's so that's definitely a thing like you yeah because

[<a id="01-49-44">01:49:44</a>]  because nobody knows how what percentage of everything people are like this and

[<a id="01-49-51">01:49:51</a>]  if you put too much on if you spend all your time reading about serial killers

[<a id="01-49-56">01:49:56</a>]  you think everyone there's a serial killer yeah yeah I don't want I don't

[<a id="01-50-00">01:50:00</a>]  want to do that because vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists no I'm

[<a id="01-50-05">01:50:05</a>]  telling you that is a fact but we start thinking like that alright how long was

[<a id="01-50-13">01:50:13</a>]  that I didn't like an hour and 40 but some of it was I think the subject

[<a id="01-50-24">01:50:24</a>]  matter made me a little tired you might take a break and do another one or

[<a id="01-50-27">01:50:27</a>]  tomorrow I gotta go I'll see you okay
