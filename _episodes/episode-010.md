In this episode, Yoshi sit down with Ben (Harry's son) for an insightful conversation that spans generational divides, reflecting on how Gen Zâ€™s worldview differs from previous generations like Gen X. They explore the impact of social media, the influence of early exposure to adult content, and the blurred lines between fantasy and reality in modern media. Ben shares his perspectives on growing up in Switzerland, the challenges young people face today, and the pressures of materialism, while the hosts delve into their own experiences navigating comedy, masculinity, and shifting cultural norms. The episode offers candid reflections on topics ranging from happiness and personal identity to feminism, social change, and the evolving concept of masculinity in a rapidly changing world.
