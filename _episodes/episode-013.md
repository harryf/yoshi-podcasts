Seventh episode with Yoshi, Christian and Harry.

Seems like we failed to record sound on the camcorder for this one.

This episode takes listeners on a thought-provoking journey through a mix of humor, philosophy, and social commentary. The hosts dive into the world of sports betting, financial speculation, and the addictive nature of risk, drawing parallels between gambling and comedy. They discuss media influence, political ideologies in modern education, and the evolution of activism, critiquing the certainty of youth-driven movements. A deep dive into Ted Kaczynski’s life and manifesto raises ethical and philosophical questions about technology, individualism, and control. Along the way, they touch on Breaking Bad, MKUltra, and even Lenin’s Swiss connections, all wrapped in their signature irreverent humor.
