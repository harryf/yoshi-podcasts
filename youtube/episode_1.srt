00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,159
that day we were we were in taxi and the

40
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,079
guy was driving us and we they freaking

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,600
around and then we had he parked and my

42
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,360
walked out and walked into this building

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
wasn't sure if if it's the right

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,000
apartment and a guy said and my brother

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,959
was way too young something something

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,480
something was it this and in Japan this

just took myself and my younger brother

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,760
before he figured out that we were

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,480
completely out of the

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,799

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,120
procedure when you assault somebody just

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,159

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,760

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,920
are you saying like so you attacked your

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,400
aunt no no no no um different things so

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,799
the first time like when I was 10 or

94
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,000
11 you know my mother kidnapped us we

95
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,239
were living with

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,120
my mother's second oldest sister and she

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,079
was with her boyfriend John we called

98
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,360

working at the

102
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,320
I could do math so I did Fast

103
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,560
calculation change and stuff you know so

104
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,600
he would just like scan all the stuff

105
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,000
and a guy walked in one time he I think

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,280
he was trying to buy something small put

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,680
$5 on the counter so I was I did it um

108
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,759
the T and I was ready to get change and

109
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,680
I think my uncle was trying to put it

110
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,440
back all of a sudden he punched my uncle

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,520
in the face reach over and tried to grab

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,560
cash out of the register you know and

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,800
you're yeah and you're you're 10 at this

114
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,320
point 10 or 11 okay and then uh I mean I

115
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,080
didn't even hesitate I grabbed the gun

116
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,479
and and and try tried to shoot the guy

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,960
of course I missed and it was so close

118
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,440
it was just kind of embarrassing like

119
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,039
I'm anti- John Wick you know like I I

120
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,080
can't even

121
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,319
hit so my uncle's bleeding and because

122
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,919
the recoil I hit myself in the face I'm

123
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,360
bleeding the guy is scared he doesn't

124
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,960
would he loses

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,319
$5 and it it was just it was it's like a

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,160
US politic just mess there's no way

127
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,960
the whole thing you know so he just ran

128
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,880
he just ran but um the reason I'm

129
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
telling you the story because you

130
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,919
thought it was funny my aunt was mad

131
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,280
because missed the guy you see how crazy

132
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,199
that is like most adults say like thank

133
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,840
God you didn't kill kill the man like

134
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,880
longterm she doesn't give a [ __ ] she

135
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,160
just said like she basically said what

136
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,039
what are you [ __ ] [ __ ] like you

137
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
can't even shoot the guy in the face and

138
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,400
she pointed to him going back and forth

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,919
like this is how you do it all right

140
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,080
like take that black guy take that black

141
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,840
guy white guy black guy Mex no no Becca

142
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,240
take it black guy Mexican I don't know

143
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,599
why she keeps saying blacks and Mexicans

144
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,080
even though it was a white guy punching

145
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,800
my uncle and there's no mexic in that

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,039
area maybe some

147
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,639
blacks but uh six years later when she

148
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,960
had a grow bar down in La she got robbed

149
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,080
by bunch of Mexicans she was like see I

150
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,160
told you maybe that's payback though for

151
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,160
her karma but yeah it was

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,440
like my mother's father was a rich man

153
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,360
in

154
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,919
and when he passed away

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,800
supposedly his younger brother and

156
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,680
sister took everything left my

157
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,039
grandmother with nothing with like four

158
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,599
daughters and a son maybe five I can't I

159
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,520
don't know how many aunts I have in that

160
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,160
side so I think they became very

161
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,120
desperate and you

162
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,639
know I don't think my aunt was like that

163
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,080
because based on what other people told

164
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
but like all the failures and and

165
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,800
trusting people losing money I think it

166
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,680
kind of turned her into kind of hard

167
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,120
person you know right so um but at least

168
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,440
she tried you know and she gave it a red

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,759
hot go but well you but but you know

170
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,800
what's funny is like out of all the

171
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,840
women who raised us she probably was the

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,599
best person how come because I think she

173
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,800
was fair you know she she makes sure I

174
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,479
went to school make sure I did my

175
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
homework my mom did none of that [ __ ]

176
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,160
man I think she was just depressed the

177
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,840
whole time she I don't know

178
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,879
um if I there's a y Mama choke in there

179
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,680
somewhere yeah I think think I think

180
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,919
because she was kind of I'm not saying

181
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,400
they put a gun to her head but I think

182
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,039
she ended up marrying the person she

183
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,080
didn't want to marri and difficult

184
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,400
family

185
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,039
circumstance and she so she she just

186
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,159
like I was saying like that show I did

187
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,960
for you Tuesday where I was being

188
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:51,919
sincere and hoping to get some empathy

189
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,720
and saying well imagine you know every

190
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,919
morning when my mother see my face it's

191
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,479
a reminder of her unhappiness and I was

192
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,800
expecting a sympathy if the whole

193
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,440
[ __ ] room laugh that I was like oh

194
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,680
okay well I wasn't expecting a laughter

195
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,520
at that spot so people always surpris

196
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,360
you you know first time I saw

197
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,680
pornography my parents are fighting and

198
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,919
U it's really bad cuz my dad my mom

199
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,759
didn't want to Mar my mom she was kind

200
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,319
of for it's like a range maror so she

201
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,440
was very resentful so every time she

202
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,759
used to see my face my face kind of

203
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,039
remind her unhappiness you know

204
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,039
and you know what's so interesting I

205
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:32,599
didn't expect laughter in that part um

206
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,760
cuz most Americans feel bad for me

207
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:38,640
but that's a that's a new one okay um I

208
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,519
wasn't trying to be funny but okay um I

209
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
think there's there's something there

210
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,440
and I can't I can't express there's

211
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,640
something Swiss there yeah because

212
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,320
because if for her it must be weird

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,519
looking at the little Asian kid because

214
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,920
don't they all look the same oh yes yes

215
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,920
no I don't I don't mean that there uh I

216
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,200
mean it is true but go

217
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,000
ahead sometime I can can't even tell my

218
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,079
mother mother of my kids used to call

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,800
call a many s she's like these Swiss

220
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:13,320
Amazons and there's like the the the

221
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,360
mother the matriarch of Swiss families

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,600
is something to be studied because you

223
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,160
look at this city like the men are not

224
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,120
men the men are here pretty weak in

225
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,800
terms of their attitude and it's the

226
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,920
it's the women you watch with the kids

227
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,480
and the whole families out who's running

228
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,000
the show there's something there and

229
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,360
it's it's uh yeah and there's also this

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,120
thing of um I don't know like like this

231
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,640
City's full of of people that have been

232
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,839
academic

233
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,000
overachievers and there's there's a role

234
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
that mothers play there as well so I'm

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320
glad I'm glad you said this because I

236
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,000
think I might be a little wrong to think

237
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,640
everyone that lives in zurk is a

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
representative the whole country because

239
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,959
if I go out in farms I think you have a

240
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,519
pretty sturdy hearty men who does a hard

241
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,279
[ __ ] different very different people

242
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,680
out there yeah and you know I mean they

243
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,320
were doing all kinds of [ __ ] that's not

244
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,240
PC these days you know yeah yeah for

245
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,680
sure but hold on say so and back in

246
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,200
before like before the kidnapping yeah

247
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,360
what is I mean I call it kidnapping but

248
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't I don't know I guess that's

249
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
normal in Japan I don't know how that

250
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,160
works buts just [ __ ] off but I mean what

251
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,640
like so you're going to school what what

252
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,160
else do you like how what your daily

253
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,600
life like you doing a paper round are

254
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,600
you are you earning money some how you

255
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,240
sports sports

256
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,279
yeah well when I was living with my dad

257
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,440
what a what a i me just like a dumb kid

258
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,160
wasn't really good in school um had

259
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,920
friends

260
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,800
and oh you know one one thing was

261
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,399
peculiar for sure is

262
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,160
um

263
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,760
um I I'm I'm always the kid who walk

264
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,399
furthest distance away from home like I

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,639
don't think most of these parents these

266
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,839
days were allow some kid

267
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:08,320
just walk

268
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,920
away long distance you know yeah yeah I

269
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,760
think that's kind of gone now like I

270
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,639
don't think that people walk to school

271
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,600
anymore in Japan right

272
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,360
now right it's shocking to me because

273
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,560
reverse culture shock right like I grew

274
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,000
up in Japan but I've been way so long so

275
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,959
when I went back recently there's things

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,560
that they do in Japan that is so weird

277
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
or like I can't believe it like five or

278
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,680
six year old kids will get on bus and

279
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,760
sub way go someplace really far away by

280
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,959
themselves you could never allow that in

281
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,399
state somebody's going to catch them

282
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,120
murder them you know or do something

283
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,320
Weir but that [ __ ] doesn't happen in

284
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,240
Japan anymore no they they still let

285
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,839
them do that no like but the the the the

286
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,920
murdering [ __ ] oh yeah yeah uh we don't

287
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,240

321
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,760
yeah so so I had people like that in the

322
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,440
neighborhood like you didn't know what

323
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,560
they did but they didn't they didn't

324
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,320
look regular job like my my dad actually

325
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,680
worked for company you know like wear

326
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,600
suit and [ __ ] like that what did he do

327
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,399
work for insurance

328
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,199
company I don't know what I just

329
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,920
remember he worked for insurance company

330
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:25,920
and boring

331
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,480
job and there's nothing dangerous about

332
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,560
his life you know he was always very

333
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,000
careful with everything he didn't like

334
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,480
the way he grew up with his um dad being

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,639
like a laborer so in a really bad

336
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,720
neighborhood so he wanted to climb the

337
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,800
ladder socially somehow I guess did he

338
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,959
uh was he one of those guys that

339
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,440
wouldn't come home at night after work

340
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,560
because they were too shitfaced because

341
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,320
they were drinking with the boss did

342
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,880
that already happen to him I I think

343
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,920
that's like mandatory for a lot of

344
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,720
people working for um in Japanese work

345
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,120
for companies Kisha so when you work for

346
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,199
Kisha that's kind of common thing do you

347
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,560
have to do and so that happened to him

348
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,320
too despite being very especially back

349
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,600
those days when the Japan was recovering

350
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,639
economy was great yeah yeah and but uh

351
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,519
but then then money must have been

352
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
flowing in in some sense like he had a

353
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,959
decent

354
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,160
job I never thought we were definitely

355
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,880
not rich my mom's father was a very

356
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,240
wealthy person but when my mother's

357
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,880
father my grandfather passed away he had

358
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,519
a manufacturing company they were rich I

359
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:34,079
think my dad my mother's father's

360
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,959
siblings took over everything and and

361
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,839
and my grand grandmother ended up with

362
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,959
nothing oh wow and that's why I think

363
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,519
the struggle kind of started from that

364
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,759
point on and I think my mom was was kind

365
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,279
of forced to marry my dad you know yeah

366
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,680
back then you have uh too many I mean I

367
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,440
think my mom had like four or five

368
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,800
sisters and one brother or something

369
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,560
like that so they could they just have

370
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,800
to get start getting rid of the kids you

371
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,800
know couldn't afford that but she

372
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,800
she married the wrong guy you know just

373
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,720
he was a nice guy but just um they were

374
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,360
not compatible you know so that's that's

375
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,240
the thing like whenever I think um my

376
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,240
friends or me things doesn't work about

377
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,880
the opposite sex like it's better that

378
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,959
end and like uh not drag it you know oh

379
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,600
my God yes it's not fun it's not fun but

380
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:24,720
but it's the other the other side is

381
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,000
horrible like string it out and then

382
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,600
then weird [ __ ] happen so but okay let's

383
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,319
go to the first kidnapping

384
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,240
then so second

385
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:38,279
grade she says to grab oil Stu we got in

386
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,639
taxi we went to this

387
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,040
apartment within a couple

388
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,800
days I'm going to a different school I

389
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,839
have no idea where the [ __ ] we are and

390
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,560
uh so she could just do that she could

391
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,000
just put you in a different school every

392
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,040
year in Japan um I don't know I forgot

393
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,519
the word but it's something like

394
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,800
Vanishing there's people in Japan under

395
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,800
pressure or they're in a really bad Sons

396
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,079
or they owe money they literally

397
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,399
disappear change their name reappear

398
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,240
someplace else in

399
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,160
Japan the guy who made the show Tokyo

400
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,639
Vice he had a podcast go Vanishing or

401
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,720
something like that talk about that and

402
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,079
Japan is not a large com country and

403
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,720
it's amazing that you could do that but

404
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:21,560
people do that all the time you know so

405
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,880
for whatever reason they disappeared

406
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,319
that's crazy so it's kind of socially

407
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,839
accepted kind of like I don't know if

408
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,800
it's socially accepting but socially

409
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,600
known to happen you know and uh um yeah

410
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,519
so

411
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,759
I she did she did that and eventually

412
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,560
you know with you and your brother yeah

413
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,360
and I think within a month or two old

414
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,040
son okay you're going to see your father

415
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,360

416
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,519
someplace else and I see Dad you know

417
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,480

418
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,480
like how come Dad we move here what

419
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,880
happened to her dad she she doesn't say

420
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,399
you know Asian parents are all [ __ ]

421
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,440
Liars they never tell you what's going

422
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,679

425
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,160
movie because couple

426
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,480
things Chinese grandparents are okay

427
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,480
with their grandkids being homosexual

428
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,199
what po of planet do you live in that's

429
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,240
like homosexual Jews in Hollywood think

430
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,120
that's normal you

431
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,400
know do you honestly that's going to be

432
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,120
okay I'll tell you what most likely it's

433
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,240
going to happen the gay grandson

434
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,400
daughter is sleeping in middle of the

435
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,039
night some people walk in the room with

436
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,520
a [ __ ] big wooden Mallet beating the

437
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,760
[ __ ] out of that person or do something

438
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,440
horrendous and at the end of the movie

439
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,919
Asian parents apologizing their Asian

440
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,280
kids yeah there's a limit for SC uh

441
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,200
fantasy and science fiction and there's

442
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,159
a limit to that and that's never going

443
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,840
to happen I was that this is the most

444
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:01,360
stupidest movie ever you know it's only

445
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,919
Jews and this homosexual make this

446
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,360
fantasy that Asian parents apologize to

447
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,960
their kids this never happened but

448
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,080
there's something about I wish that

449
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,120
movie in a cinema and there was this

450
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,840
it's a it's a great actor whatever I

451
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,640
understand non- Asian people like it but

452
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,240
I was watching like but there's a this

453
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
is a fantasy they're not going to poy

454
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,720
their kids I love the fact that that

455
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,120
you're say you're boiling down that

456
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,400
movie to Asian parents never apologize

457
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,400
to their kids and that's the fanty maybe

458
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,919
never hang on because they had a woman

459
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,720
in there with sausage fingers yeah now

460
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,039
it clearly was a fantasy like you know

461
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,960
I've been to places like Hiroshima

462
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,120
Nagasaki I've seen people with sausage

463
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:45,159
fingers oh [ __ ] so that wasn't really

464
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,320
that unusual to me in fact I saw people

465
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:50,320
from surviving that I'm old enough to

466
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,559
remember I call them bacon face I called

467
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,919
them okonomiyaki face like a Japanese

468
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,919
pizza face because the residue of the

469
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
burn I remember seeing their faces and

470
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,440
of course I'm insens of kid I just

471
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,600
started laughing at their faces holy

472
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,080
[ __ ] but I didn't understand the World

473
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,280
War II and I didn't I thought I thought

474
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,039
they look like that because they did

475
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,520
something bad which clearly they did

476
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,720
because they bombed Pro

477
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,600
harvor you know that French writer uh

478
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,520
Marcel PR am I saying his the name

479
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
remembers the things pass of course I

480
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,200
didn't read it because it's such a

481
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,039
massive volumes of books but there was a

482
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,120
couple passages where it's interesting

483
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,720
it's huge books right like so so but I

484
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,760
remember

485
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,000
um something that we had to read in

486
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,679
class where there's

487
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,880
something either it was like a flower or

488
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,240
or cooking or something anyway that main

489
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,440
protagonist smell something and that

490
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,159
trigger certain memories that is very

491
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,880
true when I went back to that

492
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,960
neighborhood grow up certain food

493
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,120
certain smell certain buildings it did

494
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,080
bring a lot of stuff back you know right

495
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,840
so but did did you

496
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,320
remember being there when you oh of

497
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,480
course you you remember being there that

498
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,919
some of the ladies I knew the

499
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,120
neighborhood was clearly hookers looking

500
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,320
back right but you didn't know that at

501
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,840
the time no I remember like one of the

502
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,320
ladies that could you go me something I

503
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:23,000
did and when I came back she showed me

504
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:26,000
her tits so that was payment yeah but

505
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,960
see good tids it was really weird when

506
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,880
she did that because if you're young

507
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,840
enough you go a public

508
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,360
bath and so if you went with your dad as

509
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,360
a kid like we have a bath at home but I

510
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,640
think we were having some kind

511
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,520
of problem they're fixing the bathroom

512
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,600
or something so they they took me to

513
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,200
public bath I remember going with my dad

514
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,480
so if you're young enough you you go

515
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,080
because I'm a boy so you go with Dad and

516
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,159
because I'm short soon as I walk in I'm

517
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,280
at the dick level so all this men's dick

518
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,320
you know I'm walking in dicks are coming

519
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,159
at you you like remember in Star Wars

520
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,600
when uh Millennium Falon asteroid the

521
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,640
[ __ ] are coming at me right but if

522
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,480
you're young enough you could go with

523
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,480
your mom and I've seen naked people

524
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,279
ladies right so I've seen naked and and

525
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,120
because I didn't grow up in the west

526
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,679
there was never like Shame about bodies

527
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,919
and stuff okay I'm going to do this were

528
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,400
they all pixeled the dicks still I had

529
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,840
to squint really

530
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,600
hard I could see the

531
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,360
future but so she's so this this woman

532
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,279
shows you his his payments and you're

533
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,200
just like whatever basically you know

534
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,600
what well or you or you went it it was a

535
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,720
little different with that because you

536
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,039
know you know that joke um it's not I

537
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,039
don't know if it's joke but David T

538
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,960
talked about this one time he was

539
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,640
talking about how weird it is when you

540
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,880
go to New York City like a low man like

541
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,039
a really nice Soho and places like that

542
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,080
I don't remember the joke how he said it

543
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:55,600
but he was funny that um you know

544
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,240
sometime these rich people have a really

545
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,159
pedigree dogs and they have a sweater on

546
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,720

sticking out of the dog like you don't

549
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:09,919
put a sweater on it looks normal but

550
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,120
soon as you put a sweater on it just

551
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,400
looked like it looked like your

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,880

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,720
this made it more special for some

560
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,919
reason but I didn't I couldn't

like maybe even younger because okay the

572
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,080
thing I'm going to tell you right now is

573
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,480
one of the the thing I tell beginning

574
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:12,240
the show that I did in Scotland and uh

575
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,799
um so it was one of like a typical night

576
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,520
they're arguing I'm sleeping all of time

577
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,279
I wake up because they're screaming and

578
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,320
my brother run in tried to stop my

579
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,600
parents from fighting uhhuh and I hate

580
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,960
seen that

581
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,480
[ __ ] I usually put a blanket over my

582
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,159
head just ignore it's not happening but

583
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,799
that particular day I I got so sick of I

584
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,760
went down

585
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,919
downstairs to that room like on the

586
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,880
office and

587
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,320
um my dad had a bunch of books in there

588
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
and these are like a really big books

589
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,000
you know and like I don't know why I did

590
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,720
it but I usually pile all this friend

591
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,279
books to pile them up trying to make

592
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,240
like a

593
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,360
castle so I could go and kind of hide so

594
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,520
I piled up and they were just screaming

595
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,320
arguing for so long so I piled it up I

596
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,799
need a couple more books to finish so I

597
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,240
could be inside in Clos and hide and I

598
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,400
ran out of book books and I used all the

599
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,960
books until I noticed on the top shelf

600
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,960
there's a couple books up there so I put

601
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,880
a chair climb up got those books and I

602
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,360
never noticed before that but but these

603
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,200
are special books and and they're

604
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,279
basically nude pictures and people are

605
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,159
engaged in Sex and um and they're not

606
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,960
Asian people they're like Europeans I I

607
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:24,559
think my dad I don't know it's one of

608
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,919
those fancy Ary sex books you know

609
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,640
basically French something French I

610
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,360
think yeah so I was confused because I

611
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,279
look at them a couple things happened

612
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,440
that was confusing to me

613
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:39,159
one one of them was magazine rest of the

614
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,960
books one of the magazine you know how

615
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:45,919
in the 6070 80s porn they put stars in

616
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,960
their genitalia yeah oh yeah yep

617
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,679
okay I thought these white people had

618
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,679
Stars

619
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,760
permanently I thought they were aliens

620
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,720
right cuz I've never seen white people

621
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,039
before

622
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,600
so the young younger listeners it's it

623
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,919
put a start because they're censoring

624
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,320
that but I didn't I thought the

625
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,279
these white I've never seen why people

626
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
have stars as dicks yeah so I thought

627
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,159
they're alien because that's why they

628
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,320
have stars whatever right right but the

629
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,159
most bizarre part the part that made me

630
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,960
I think years looking back this was the

631
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,039
first

632
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,440
thing clearly put me in the

633
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,760
path is that they were doing something

634
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,360
that I've never seen before so there

635
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,720
scenes of of course they engage in sex

636
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,960
but I don't know what that was that

637
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,080
that's not the part that interested me

638
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,600
there was a other parts where they were

639
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,200
hugging and kissing each other it's

640
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,240
something I never saw my parents do holy

641
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,440
[ __ ] so I didn't know what this

642
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,679
was so you saw a hog in a book The First

643
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,880
Time In po well I mean Asian people

644
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
don't do that in generally speaking no

645
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,640
they don't actually they don't do that

646
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,320
so I didn't I didn't the new thing

647
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,880
didn't bother me cuz I grew up public B

648
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,159
I've seen people naked so I don't have I

649
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,120
didn't grow up like somebody telling me

650
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,039
nudity is bad or right much l sex

651
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,360
because I didn't even know what that was

652
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,720
but this is the first time I saw like I

653
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,480
don't know what this

654
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,000
is but they seem to like each other they

655
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,799
seem to be very

656
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,240
sweet something that my parents don't do

657
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,520
I don't know what this is but this seems

658
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,760
like it's a wonderful thing and we could

659
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,960
use more of this in the world and this

660
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,919
this this what's my introduction to

661
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,799
pornography really this is the first

662
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,320
porn you've ever seen

663
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,240
on your dad's bookshelf and a lady

664
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,279
because because they were fighting and I

665
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,279
need a book to cover and h i and then I

666
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,520
used those to kind of cover the I just

667
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:45,039
head there you know yeah so

668
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,440
um and of course when you get

669
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,840
older must been that must been when I

670
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,120
was like six or seven years

671
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,640
old and I I it was probably another 3 or

672
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,520
4 years before my mom kidnapped us for

673
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,840
the second and the permanent time where

674
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,320
we went to USA right but so after the

675
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,559
first kidnapping yeah you did go and see

676
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,559
your dad we were allowed to see him

677
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,880
maybe once a month or every other week

678
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:13,520
or something like that right but you

679
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,640
never moved back in together did you

680
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,360
well um funny you say that cuz I

681
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,240
think maybe little over a year maybe

682
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,080
year and a half there was a knock on the

683
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:28,480
apartment door and there's my dad and

684
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,960
his best friend and my mom's like [ __ ]

685
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,679
they found us yeah cuz every time we

686
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,799
would see my dad my mom would use

687
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:40,559
multiple different routes taxi bus and

688
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,000
uh you know secret agent [ __ ] yeah so

689
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,919
and and is your mom has she got a

690
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,760
boyfriend or something

691
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:51,720
or no I never saw that maybe she did but

692
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,640
I don't know but um but how so was she

693
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,760
living off like while you're in this

694
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,760
other flat okay so in in Osaka um

695
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,240
there's a thing term called Miss mu

696
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,960
showby Mizu is water showby means

697
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,080
business it literally means water

698
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,440
business and the reason why it's called

699
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,720
that cuz uh anybody who works nighttime

700
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,159
whether restaurant or uh performance

701
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,600
artist or maybe even escort they're all

702
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,559
under one category called music Shai and

703
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,840
it's why it's called water business

704
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,640
because a lot of those kinds of

705
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,799
businesses by by uh canal with the light

706
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,720
they have a shimmering like a

707
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:32,480
otherworldly quality to it oh hence the

708
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,480
water show by you know so my mom was

709
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,360
pouring alcohol in those bars and stuff

710
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,360
and the reason I know that cuz one time

711
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,760
so imagine your second grade your Mom

712
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,760
leaves you middle of the night there's

713
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,159
no babysitter yeah that's how we lived

714
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,360
you know for like second and third grade

715
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,760
and sometime you have to explain

716
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,640
yourself you know but I couldn't believe

717
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,399
doing that to a kid these days like okay

718
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,679
your second grade your brother's barely

719
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,760
kindergarten I'm leaving I'll be back in

720
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,559
the morning or whatever so she did night

721
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,080
shifts at the bar

722
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,200
those working at those Club yeah and

723
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,840
just leaving us you know holy [ __ ] but

724
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,919
she's so I mean she's basically because

725
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,840
your dad's beating her up or something

726
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,559
no no my dad never did that if anything

727
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,679
my my dad will get hit by my mom my

728
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,799
dad's never been a violent guy it's

729
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,840
always my mom hitting my dad okay so but

730
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,080
so she just wanted to get away like so

731
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,080
what why why was he so

732
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,640
repellent he had multiple sister telling

733
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:34,240
him what to do

734
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,679
and he's not willing to do what uh my

735
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,080
mom was telling him to do maybe he

736
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:43,799
wasn't successful enough and um

737
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,480
also my mom always remind me that

738
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:49,480
character from FL Bears Madam baly she

739
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,640
had this fantasy world where she

740
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,440
envisioned living a better life maybe in

741
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,720
entertainment singing cuz she was an

742
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,559
excellent singer and a cook and she

743
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,799
wanted

744
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,360
life better she was a bit artsy I don't

745
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,200
know she's artsy but she like attention

746
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,360
and things like that you know okay and

747
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,440
my dad was

748
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,279
not it well I mean she just that's not

749
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,559
that's not within his personality you

750
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,240
know you work in insurance company

751
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:19,399
you're a risk averse person you

752
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,120
know so I know for whatever reason it

753
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,120
didn't work out so but then if so in a

754
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,360
way what she's doing is she's escaping a

755
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,159
role she has to play so she's got to

756
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,600
play the role of the mother of the

757
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,240
family she she hat she hated my dad she

758
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,120
hated my dad's family she didn't like

759
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,760
the circumstan although she probably

760
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,760
liked Liv in Japan better than Korea

761
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,159
because Japan was doing economically way

762
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,799
better incredibly well compared to Korea

763
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,559
as an upgrade to them be working in bars

764
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,880
that's like that's kind of economic she

765
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:53,000
rather work and live on her own than

766
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,120
have this guy that she just didn't want

767
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,360
to be with you know that's inter joke so

768
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,840
I mean that yeah for a fantasy if like

769
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,519
her dream is to be some kind of

770
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,799
performer like this oppression of this I

771
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,360
I don't I don't know because I'm just

772
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,679
trying to understand I'm trying to

773
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,080
understand too but uh these people even

774
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,760
even if you ask my I even if my dad was

775
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,799
alive he just W answer that he just

776
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:22,279
won't say anything quite you know and

777
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:24,799
then uh man of a few words I

778
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:28,039
mean he just he just wasn't very

779
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:31,039
talkative and uh he doesn't say anything

780
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,440
revealing yeah and my mom even she's

781
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,960
stealing something I don't I don't know

782
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,399
if I should believe that you know so

783
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,360
anyway it's a bad marriage let's go to

784
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:42,919
the second kidnapping then so the first

785
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,600
kidnapping happened your eventually my

786
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,679
dad found the place found the place she

787
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,519
decided to move back with my

788
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,120
dad and so that's weird and that was

789
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,039
really weird because when we moved back

790
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,919
to the old home did you change school

791
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:59,200
again of course yeah yeah and how come

792
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,000
comfortable my mom was lying to

793
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,840
neighbors like what were you do hold on

794
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,760
oh I took my kids we went to America my

795
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,120
mom was sick some [ __ ] like I'm so

796
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,080
like that's not true like you know I'm

797
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,360
open my [ __ ] mouth you know but

798
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,880
um so we we were living with my dad but

799
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:23,120
that didn't last really long because one

800
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,840
night we we summer of

801
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,919
79 we visited our relatives in USA my

802
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,360
grand was was dying and I think winter

803
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,200
was fall of 79 like a couple months

804
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,440
after we return maybe four months it's a

805
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,720
little before

806
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,360
1980 we got a phone call and my mom

807
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,960
started crying I just assumed my

808
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,840
grandmother passed away MH and to me

809
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,880
that

810
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,639
was the beginning of the end cuz I think

811
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,760
when I when we visit the USA for the

812
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:53,559
first time Sumer 79 I thought okay we're

813
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,279
back living with that things are going

814
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:58,799
well we're doing vacationing so I

815
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:02,279
thought things were okay and I was

816
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,919
really really wrong in fact 79 when uh

817
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,760
we were in Hawaii cuz it's a midpoint

818
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,080
between USA Contin us was in Japan and

819
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,639
when we went pro

820
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,000
Harbor and the trip was going well the

821
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:16,039
whole time I thought oh everything's

822
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,039
taken care of everything's going to be

823
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:20,880
okay and we're going to live like a

824
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,519
family again and not not realizing we

825
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,799
were basically two three four months

826
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,399
away from receiving phone call where my

827
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,360
mom decided to get divorced

828
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,600
and leave because I I think even for her

829
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,000
she didn't want to get a divorce when

830
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:42,519
her mom was alive right

831
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:46,000
so I just remember March 13

832
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:49,639
1980 um my mom said we're going to get

833
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,360
on the plane you're you're how old 55 no

834
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:55,279
but how old were you at that um I think

835
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,760
I was 10 years old okay I'm a couple

836
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,440
months away from turning 11 I think

837
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,240
we're going to get on plane we're going

838
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,159
to fly from Osa Japan we're flying to

839
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,880
Tokyo and I was like what why don't we

840
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,760
just take shinan in which is like bullet

841
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,000
train real and then like whatever we got

842
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,040
on playing we woke up next morning we're

843
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,079
back in Hawaii for the second time

844
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,639
because that's when my mom told us um

845
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,800
they're divorced and we we're living in

846
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,079
states there was always a bit of a

847
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,520
disorient feeling with my family and

848
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,760
then the way I grew up I think that's it

849
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,839
feels like semi on purpose in a in a way

850
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,200
it's just like let's not just talk about

851
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,240
[ __ ] let's just did there are some

852
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,079
parents do something weird to prepare

853
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,960
their kids that's not why they did it

854
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,599
they just don't give a [ __ ] yeah they're

855
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,119
smoking cigarette drinking beer think

856
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,240
it's funny you know it's that kind of

857
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,879
[ __ ] yeah that's that's the that's the

858
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,200
environment I grow up you know they're

859
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,399
just yellow trash if there's white trash

860
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,760
there's yellow trash I grow up they're

861
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,520
all yellow trash I'm telling you that's

862
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,640
what I call this episode in a way like

863
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,160
you're there as a for of entertainment

864
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,400
for them they're like I really was a

865
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,040
monkey to to my

866
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,160
momce so it was a lot of that stuff but

867
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,200
I think because of that I think I was

868
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,730
more tolerant of different kinds of

869
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:19,119
people and different ideas you know

870
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,119
